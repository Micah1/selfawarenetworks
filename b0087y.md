Oscillator Memory Pings

00:00

I suspect that the oscillation kind of in and in the brain of the power band, like our power band and it might form something like a both Einstein condensate. But regardless of whether it does or doesn't, it's some, it's operating as a single band perceptive band affairs, feel that can see And observer inside the man or the woman or the person.

One memory pings, another memory one memory sends out a ping. It's electric signal. Second also champ channel and that pings other related memories to expect that they might fire next. So if the memory record sheets around your brain painting other parts of the brain. And if they're expecting suffice was the best part, then they start to get ready.

01:14

They can alert entire sequences of the brain like long-term sequences about what to expect because it actually everywhere it gets repeated. 

01:48

So you have to your two or more complete in the whole, distinct memories that will interact with. This one will thing the other constantly.

02:42

So long-term oscillating memories

02:50

Of VP. So, memory sticks around for a long time. I just it just. All right there. I have to learn the mechanism of playback. Is it seems like if you learn a memory, the next day, they said, is that once it's that you can have a memory that's learned, let's becomes synaptic change, and that affects the future firing.

03:24

That's synaptic change. Ensures, that what happened before is likely is more likely to happen again. So, if you get a memory that triggers a similar synaptic change,

03:46

It's going to eventually.

03:54

Effect that oscillator and update the update. The, the memory weights that oscillator and if it happens enough times, then,

04:10

The memory that keeps oscillating because of the synaptic changes conversions. With the new memory that also is oscillating at a different time of day and in a way that affects the similar area and causes long-term awesome letter change there. But memories are essentially, the replay of memory is essentially.

04:50

Sort of like a, I would guess it's sort of like, a random simulation of a cortical area and not random. But what makes it non-random, is that the

05:15

The neurons that fired previously are the ones that are going to play back because their paths, were the ones. Who, who is the past that were taken? Are the ones that

05:39

Are more likely to be taken again because things change. The other sounds of excitement and channels of inhibition. You had receptivity growing during the challenge of activation. And inhibition going during the, in the direction of inhibitor circuits. Chinese a little bit more about how they have campers, replace memories.

06:17

So previous memories will create a tractors for their own recurrence because the whole thing is an oscillator. So, they'll just create a curve over time of shaping that they're likely heard of the timing of their firing, the reshaping, the timing of the network.
