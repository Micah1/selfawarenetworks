This is about how the sensory bulbs collect information in neural ganglia arrays, and then pass information throughout the brain, it’s also about how each sensory organ is creating a 3D + 1D representation of whatever sensory information it is receiving, because with each iteration of time, the front most sensor array is collecting a 2D sensor grid of information in a valid sense.
But the brain is taking multiple snapshots of the world, from different perspectives, with each sensory organ, and correlating what each 2D sensory data has in common, with coincidence detection. Similar to how the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem works, or similar to how Tomography works, if you take multiple images around a 3D object, a computer can analyze what those images have in common, and reconstruct a 3D model from those 2D images. It does this because it can figure out the perspective a photo was taken from, by lining up what different photos of the same object from different perspectives have in common, in other words the computer is computing a 3D image from 2D images by noticing all the correlations or commonalities or coincidences, neurons basically excel at coincidence detection, so every sensory organ in the human body from eyes, ears, smell, taste, skin, and inner sense detection is collecting many samples of data with essentially 2D sensor arrays and then tomographically constructing a 3D representation of incoming sensory data through neural coincidence detection, and also regular cellular coincidence detection. These signals are then passed from the first array of ganglia neurons in the sensory organs to many more sequences of essentially 2D dimensional neural arrays that flow from the sensory organs along sensory pathways to the thalami, the central brain areas, and then throughout the neocortex in circular feedback loops that eventually result in signal changes to the motor output pathways, leading to voice moments, eye movements, hand, finger and feet movements as well as other body movements.

# Virtual Reality field of view +

Light Field, Low Latency, Low Persistence John Carmack: Why I think he went from VR to AI, meaning that I think of how a VR headset works as a possible building block for understanding that the human mind has to create representations of reality, sort of like a game engine, for your eyes to see in the VR headset. The analogy of what a VR set is doing, rendering your perspective, based on your head position, gives us something to think about, in terms of how the rendering in our minds has to change with our head & eye position.

This next article connects to VR & Carmack, because they are talking about eye images having a stable rendering (without using the word rendering) when you rotate your head, that is what VR does it renders the image based on your head position & head orientation with low latency, and low persistence, so your vision of the world seems to be stable as you move your head, but for that to happen the image rendered in the organisms brain needs to be updated with the eye position

"Object representation in a gravitational reference frame" "Gravitational tuning depended on vestibular/somatosensory but also visual cues, consistent with previous evidence that IT processes scene cues for gravity’s orientation. In addition to stability across image rotations, an internal gravitational reference frame is important for physical understanding of a world where object position, posture, structure, shape, movement, and behavior interact critically with gravity."

What is interesting is that if you combine the idea that your brain is doing gravitational reference frames with the book "A Thousand Brains" that suggests that every cortical column in the brain is creating reference frames to manage the spatial position & orientation of every 3D semantically segmented objected in your ecosystem, including everything you are seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, feeling, tasting, or balancing on, then you have to imagine the possibility that a gravitational reference frame is either calculated in each cortical column, or transmitted to each cortical column involved in processing your environment.
