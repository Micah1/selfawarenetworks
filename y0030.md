# SciSummary:
**Key Points**

1. The paper discusses the concept of consciousness and focuses on the role of temporally and spatially oscillating information in the brain.

2. It introduces the idea of a live rendering within the brain where language, math, and visualization processes occur in a volumetric theater, characterized by real-time transmission and reception of signals within the brain.

3. The paper suggests that this live rendering and temporal-spatial reactivity are indicative of consciousness in a computer system or organism, allowing for reactions to new information in real time, potentially leading to novel thinking, choices, and deeper strategizing.

**Synopsis**

The research paper focuses on the concept of consciousness and the role of temporally and spatially oscillating information in the brain. The author discusses the idea of a live rendering within the brain, where language, math, and visualization processes occur in a volumetric theater. This live rendering is different from existing neural networks and is characterized by the real-time transmission and reception of signals within the brain, allowing for reactions to new information in real time. The paper suggests that this live rendering and temporal-spatial reactivity are hallmarks of consciousness in a computer system or organism. The system's ability to react to new and novel information surrounding it indicates conscious operation. The paper also mentions the potential for novel thinking and choices as well as deeper strategizing in systems with this live rendering capability.

 Part of what makes information conscious is that it's temporally and spatially oscillating across the volumetric matrix or tensor field that is your brain.

 And imagine that you have a sort of like live... imagine that your brain has the language model and you have the ability to do diffusion rendering images and even short movies like you can like I feel like I am getting good at like i feel like i am getting good at imagining topological transformations really complex ones that only can numbers help me visualize math uh and um This is, you know, you can imagine math as a series of shapes, right? And imagine moving those shapes around to do calculations.

 Imagine numbers, right? The shapes represent numbers, you move them around, you transform them, and they represent new numbers.

 Anyway, so this is an idea that, you know, hey wait a second, let me give a link.

 The part of your brain that's good with language, math, and visualization.

 And we're doing all that live in a volumetric theater.

 All the different representations are combined in the same arena.

 So, it's multi-modal, but specifically it's different from existing neural networks because it's a sort of live rendering.

 The rendering is happening internally and the rendering represents to the organism or to the computer system its own representations, its own transformations of the incoming signal data and the remembered or learned information and self-generated knowledge self-generated knowledge.

 So yeah so I'm not saying that this is all that's required for consciousness but that is part of one of the indicators of consciousness, detecting consciousness in a computer system, is that there is a sort of tensor field of signals that are in real time being transmitted and being read by the same system over space and time over space and time and it's being generated by itself and read to itself and these are hallmarks or earmarks of what a conscious system is.

 A way to identify whether a system is operating consciously.

 It has a live or running time.

 Yeah and so the signal and the thing is like so the signals signals are constantly reactive to the environment so they're running in a temporal spatial the internal signals reactivate so they're running at a temporal spatial rate that allows them to be to react in real time to new and novel information surrounding the organism or system.

 You have, if you don't have this, all of our computer programs are not... you'd have to basically... to achieve this in a computer you might run a computer much more slowly than computers run to maintain a sort of like live circuit I mean it doesn't have to... it's sort of like a live circuit that's constantly being transformed by perturbations from sensory apparati plugged into it so that its information information transforms are somewhat at the pace of the environment and to the degree that it exceeds the pace of the environment it will have novel thinking, novel choices.

 It will be able to plan ahead more deeply to strategize.
