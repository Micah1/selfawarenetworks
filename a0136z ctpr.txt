Neural Array-Projection Tomography
I am suggesting that a neuron is projecting its phase to an array of neurons connected to its exit terminal, and those exit terminal receiving neurons are simultaneously receiving phases from other neurons via other synapses, the neurons learn new patterns by adjusting their synapses, some synapses are told to speed up, slow down, fire, or become inhibited from firing, and they pass on one of each of these four signals to each branch of their exit terminal. Each neuron in the receiving array now represents how much of the pattern that it was receptive to was received by sending a phase that represents some indicator of how much it has seen.

How do two neurons that are not connected form a connection after each of them has fired? It's not that they wire together, its that synchrononous firing, or firing within some window that might be a few milliseconds causes neurons to oscillate together, it's not that they are wired together, its that the synaptic tree that connects them aligns itself so that they will fire together when they both detect a pattern that they have learned together, but this also allows an entire set of neurons to possibly be the one neuron to fire in response to a pattern that many have learned, it makes patterns invariant to any single synapse or any single neuron and any neural circuit inside a cortical column oscillator because the oscillator as oscillator as collective has learned to represent the pattern invariant to its original firing location, the pattern can be transmitted across the brain, to entrain other similar patterns, but also to vote with, correct, and fix the representations collected by other neural circuits but also add to them, like the display I described the oscillator as being had many layers, like photoshop layers, but these are layers of interlinked renderings, at different scales, representing different sections of the screen at different times depending on head position & orientation & incoming sensory data.

What is the survival advantage of fireflies oscillating together?
well they can become a sensor array effectively, since they are all timed the same they can all simultaneously observe through expectation when all of the others will fire because the light pattern is repetative, if one of them goes dark, because it was eaten by the tongue of a toad the entire group is aware of it instantenously and flies away rapidly from that location. If one of them finds food it begins to oscillate faster or brighter than the rest, and so they converge attracted literally by the excitement signals which are either brighter or more rapid or both.

When neurons oscillate together they become a sensory array that can represent patterns in 3D and in 4D, because they represent a phase field that has memory, that can observe its own decoherence & coherence.

So the array is an oscillating group of neurons, and that learns patterns that get stored in the synaptic connections and spines of each dendrite.

Each layer of neurons in an oscillating group, is compressing a detected pattern into a phase change that is adding one delta of detail, like a shade of color, or a touched edge, to a complex multi-dimensional sensory representation that is akin to the 3D model created by slides in the Fourier Projection Slice Theorem, except its a 4D model, playing out over time across the neocortex's oscillators, when we communicate with other people that is also


"Today I cut some topics from this book I'm writing, in some cases some of the ideas like the one about microtubules need perhaps months more time research.

What I think is that injecting neurotransmitters is going to excited some cells and depress others, this may cause both pleasure and or depression, it may cause excitement or inhibition, but basically it is stimulating cell firing activity, so it might improve your memory function, 

This book is about starting a conversation. I'm a journalist not a physicist, but sometimes I have what I consider to be interesting ideas, and I would like to ask a physicist what they think. So this book has some wild ideas, that I want to talk to the experts about, and then I want to share those conversations with everyone, and develop a second edition of this book next year that compiles what I have learned since the first edition of the book.
