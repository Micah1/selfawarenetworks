Infinitely, small functions, infinitely, small functions. Okay, so what that is? It's like imagine if you really looking at category theory, so a. So a if you do is a totally is a transformation for me to be some could be some, it could be, we could be talking about a differential transformation and anthropology through another component to another apology.

00:32

Right there could be several steps right? Could be a to be, but the point is that eventually it ends up with a if it goes a to be to see but within B there's in there there's an infinite number of possible. Variations on would be could be in the sense that like B could be B plus I mean B could be like X or Y or Z or N or B as long as a plus B equals C.

01:15

So that means you have different function as long as as long as the function resulted in see. All right, so if you do a transform, some data setters and topology to be and then then you go from B transform to describe another transformation of that data set and to see, right?

01:40

So, as long as you always end up with see then, then you can substitute any variation of B, as long as you get from a, to B, to C, right now. If you made like an infinitely small function, right, infinitely small. It's like it's like the smallest possible function.

02:07

It's so small, it's infinitely small right. We're going to never know how small it is because it's just infinitely small. So it's like it's like an infinity, right? So for the idea is that it is like a negative almost like a negative affinity, which is the idea. It's like what it's like saying.

02:37

There's a whole that goes on forever.

02:46

Yeah, but yeah, I don't know how that, how that could possibly exist. Maybe it's an impossible thing, but it's some and infinite number, and it's the smallest possible. Number. And so I'm not exactly sure what that is, or if it's even possible or maybe. Well, I'm not, I mean, I guess it is possible, right?

03:07

But can you have an infinite number? That's also the smallest possible number or wouldn't, if in a number would be larger than the smallest possible. Number as another question that I'm not sure about. All right, so, but the point is that it is. It's a smallest possible number. That's really the most important thing or as well as possible value or the smallest possible representation of a function.

03:36

Like is the function was just some sort of like, you know, multiply by this vector, right? If that was the smallest possible function that could transform, you know, a to be to see, right, whatever that middle factor is, as I was like. So if you just like imagine that, if you like, okay category, there is any number of functions of any of any length and enemy complexity as is if B could be in any number of functions.

04:12

Very length and any complexity as long as they to be to see as long as age is as long as a contrast form and to be in B can transform into C. Then B can be anything as long as it results in C from a, right. So there's there's different like there's different paths to go from a to be to see.

04:40

There's the alternate that's like, saying okay well, and first case we're gonna we're gonna take a and we're gonna subtract a number and we're gonna add number and for me, and then result to see and for for, for, for being multiplying. And then, we're going to divide, and we're gonna get sea.

05:06

And so, yeah. So any version of B is composable to any other and and effectively like A is. So if B is infinite infinitely, small, it's like it's almost as if A is causing C, right? Because it's like, okay. Well, if you get to the point where like, where if whatever A is pressing on results and see, right, then then you can you could say the ACRC even though a cars be and because C, because because you could you can, yeah.

05:57

If we can show that there's an infinite number of possible ways to prayer to be function, the transforms a functioning to a C function. Then and we can take the smallest representation of that and and just realize that like whatever kind of transformation does it's it can be a negligible transformation so it's just as if your a caused me so like many costly.

06:39

Because the causal, because the causal factor is

06:47

No matter how complex it is. I mean, I mean, I guess you could say well,

06:56

Is interesting because you wanted, you want to make an argument that somehow maybe be has a free actor that could have, you know, maybe there's something that can happen and be that could prevent C for happening and that and, you know, I guess that's possible.
