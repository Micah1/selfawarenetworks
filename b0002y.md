Note about the audio: I did not participate in this recording, at least not in this part of this recording. I saved it for two reasons.

1. The discussion of covalent bonding was useful to me to imagine how oscillatory synchronization of brainwave signal transmissions might serve as a temporary analogy of bonding, it's useful to think of our rendered & phenomenologically conscious qualia as kind of snapping together almost magnetically in a very stable way thanks to the physics of oscillation regulating our internal states, allowing our brainwaves to serve as attractors that bind or bring together distributed internal renderings in both space & time. The physics of our neurobiology snaps together a high level computationally rendered representation of reality that exists in a distributed way across the brain's network.

2. It helped me to think of how the surface of a sensor, or the surface of satellite dish is essentially a bunch of atoms oscillating in a similar or homogenous pattern across the entire surface, and this similarity helped me to think of the hive of fireflies (while reading the book Sync by Steven Strogatz) as single sensor array, because they were all synchronized together in the same oscillation. I don't think that author Steven Strogatz actually ever describes the group of synchronized fireflies as analogous to a sensor array, but it was what I was thinking when I read his book. It's because the tiny signals passed between fireflies continuously would cause them to eventually oscillate their light flashing together that I realized that if one firefly was captured by the tongue of a toad, or by a bug eating plant, or by some other predator, the omission of that fireflies signal would be felt by the entire collective because they were oscillating together, because their internal clocks were set to expect signals at a certain interval from their fellow fireflies. In such a way neurons that oscillate together could also be considered as a single sensor array, indeed the human body, with all of its cells, can be considered to be analogous to homogenous material, sort of like a satellite dish at the atomic scale, but closer to a hive of fireflies than a satellite dish, but either way I realized that the physics of oscillation allowed biological materials to magnify their functions. This is where I came with the idea of the entified Self in Self Aware Networks theory. In other words, cells are able to act as a single cell, because they replicate the same function, and that function magnifies with the area of its homogenous collaborators.

## 1: Overview of Chemical Bonding and its Importance in Life
Alec: Because there's tons of different types of physics, but describing chemistry, yeah, would
be anytime we start to invoke the making and breaking of bonds.
So electrons coming together to interact so that basically electrons can be shared between
different atoms.
So you have multiple atoms interacting to make bonds, so yeah, that's probably the best
way of describing it.

Memo: Also just before moving on, like I heard that electrons can be shared three different ways
between atoms, right?
One is to share one, right, and then one is to borrow one, and that's ionic bond or something.
Do you know about that?

Alec: Yeah.
There are kind of, okay, so what you're thinking of is like ionic and covalent bonding, right?
So there's like, there's different types of bonding where you can basically say, okay,
so the one you're describing, so ionic is probably the easiest to think about, right?
So you can say, all right, I've got an atom of sodium and an atom of chlorine, and because
one, basically there's what's called an electron affinity or how much does a certain atom want
to have its quantum levels filled.
There's an energy associated with, a stabilization energy that's associated with acquiring an
electron.

So for example, the chlorine is one electron away from having all of its quantum levels
filled, and so in order to stabilize it, it basically pulls an electron off of another
atom and then that electron fully gets pulled onto the chlorine.
So now the chlorine gets this additional electron.

The balance between the number of protons and the number of electrons is now unequal.
It's no longer a neutral atom, so the chlorine has gotten the minus charge and then the sodium
atom has a positive charge because, let's say, so the sodium atom has gotten an electron
removed and so basically because there's this complete delocalization or complete removal
of an electron from the other atom, we call that ionic bonding because now one has a charge
of a positive and the other has the charge of a negative and they become attracted through
electrostatic forces.

But the more common and complicated type of bonding that occurs in order to establish
life are bonds that are covalent and what that basically means is it's a little bit
hard to describe in classical terms, but the idea is that because the electron has particle
and wave-like properties, it actually becomes shared between multiple atoms so that if you
were to write down what is the probability that it's on one atom versus the other, it
would not be like it was in the sodium versus sodium chloride case where it's like the electron
is purely on the chloride and you basically get a massive charge on the sodium and a charge
on the chlorine that basically causes them to be electrostatically paired.
In the covalent case, you actually get energy stabilization through the fact that I've delocalized
this electron across being shared between the two atoms.

It's kind of a little bit more...

One way to think about it is also like saying kinetic energy is actually a way of stabilizing
so you have potential energy and kinetic energy and in some sense this is like a kinetic energy
acting as the major stabilizing force.

The fact that the electron moves freely over a larger area of space allows it to be shared
and then that's where you get these carbon-carbon bonds, carbon-hydrogen bonds that allow things
like amino acids and molecules to be basically paired together and then ultimately make the
biological macromolecules that we care about and the drugs that we care about.
Covalent bonding is the most, I shouldn't say the most ubiquitous, but it's the fundamental
bond that's necessary to build more complex molecules and then there's other types of
bonding that we can talk about that's a little bit more nuanced like hydrogen bonding which
is a little bit harder to explain and then there's metallic bonding which is really another
extreme where you have a bunch of metals coming together and then all the electrons really
act like a sea, they're more like a fluid.

So there are kind of these three different regimes.
One is that the electrons in the ionic case are completely split apart so they're definitely
on one atom or definitely on the other.
Then there's the covalent case where they're kind of shared in between and then there's
the metallic case where they're free flowing just like a fluid, they're wherever you want
them to be.

So that's a really kind of lame and gross description of all the types of bonding.

Memo: No, that's awesome, by the way, this showed up, I think you two never met, but this, Alec,
how are you?

## 2: Distinction Between Molecules Essential to Life and Others
Zunto: I'm doing good, I'm great, I'm glad to join this conversation, hi Alec.

Memo: Yeah, we kind of started, we dive right into it, we were just talking with each other,
atoms come together to form molecules and then that just kind of turns into chemistry.
Alec was explaining how some of the different bonds work, but Alec you said something that
you said some bonds, like some bonds between atoms are life, like you said, you said something
about life.
And then while I was reading, I also realized that there are some, like not all molecules
are made equal, right, that there are some that is more special to life.
So what's the difference?

Alec: Sure, so I guess probably the point that you picked up on is what I was saying that basically
covalent bonds we typically find in biological systems are where we associate with life and
the reason for that is that covalent bonds, because they're so strong, and because there's
this delocalization of electrons, allow us to make strings of molecules, meaning that
we were originally talking about like, well, what is the distinguishing feature between
physics and chemistry, right?
And I was saying, it's really hard to distinguish where physics stops because it doesn't, but
where would you start to say, okay, that's chemistry?
And the answer was, okay, whenever you start to see bonds, and then the question is what
type of, what is a bond and where do you see it?
And really that has to do with how electrons are shared between atoms.
And then there's many different ways that you can share electrons between atoms.
And one of those types is covalent bonding, where the electrons are shared or distributed
in almost an equal fashion between different atoms.
What this allows you to do is kind of chain link all a bunch of atoms together to make
things like polymers, which are basically, you can think of, you know, you have even
very simple multi-atom configurations like propane, ethane, butane, right, where there's
multiple carbons being strung together to make what's called a hydrocarbon.
Then you can turn into nitrogens and oxygens and all these different appendages on, and
because you can link all these different atoms together, you can make chains of all different
types of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon.
And these long chains of these composite, what we call organic atoms, as you basically
build them all together and you get this big string, that allows them then to fold into
complex structures.
And so depending on how the atoms are bonded together, they can make DNA, they can make
proteins, they can make RNA, and these different configurations all end up leading to different
strings, which all, because they're all arranged differently, lead to different 3D architectures.
And then it's those 3D architectures that actually allow all of these molecules, which
are made of the same types of atoms, to do their unique functions.
So one way I think about this is if you're standing at the edge of a harbor and you're
looking out at this harbor, you'll see yachts, you'll see sail ships, you'll see dinghies,
you'll see all different types of boats, and if I ask you, okay, well, what's very common
about all the boats?
And you say, okay, well, they're all made of the same composite material.
And so I would say, okay, yeah, like all of life really is made of the same like organic
atoms, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen.
But then you'd say, okay, well, what makes the ships different in terms of how they function?
And you would say, oh, well, how the ship is constructed, right?
Like how the engine is put in a particular position, how many stories it has, all of
the different things that come from the architecture and how the composite material is arranged
allows it to do that unique function.
So just like in life, in nature, nature arranges all of these different strings of atoms together,
even though they're all the same types of atoms, it's that arrangement of those atoms
in 3D that actually allows them to do complex functions.

## 3: Structure, Shape, and Function in Biological Molecules
Memo: So that's really interesting.
So the way I understood it, so as the atoms come together, they form some kind of a structure
first, and then there are the ends of the structures where kind of maybe let's say layman's
tundra is sticking out, and if any electron is available to form additional bonds at those
ends, then we could say literally that those are the business ends of the molecule.
Is that fair?

Alec: Yeah, maybe I'll just refine it a little bit, because what you're getting at is totally
right, right?
At the ends of the strings are at different areas where there are kind of different, what
I'll call potentials or abilities for the electrons to interact or form bonds.
Those are definitely the business ends.
Now because the business ends are not just the ends, meaning that they're not just the
ends, if I basically pulled, the way I kind of like to explain it is Legos, right?
If all of, like I was saying, all of these molecules, so every single molecule is a Lego,
I can basically build all the Lego pieces into complex structures, and then that structure
does something.
And I said, okay, let's say I build a Lego structure, and then I go, well, where's the
business end?
And you're right, you would say, well, like the edges.
That's definitely true, but it's a little bit more complicated than that in terms of
where we're actually going to form bonds, because like I was saying, the electrons in
covalent bonds can be distributed, meaning that they don't have to exist in a single
place, they can be delocalized.
And so depending on how the molecule folds up or how the Lego architecture is arranged,
the electrons could be heavily put in one end or the other, but more often than not,
these molecules actually form so that in the center of these systems, there's a high propensity
to make and form new bonds.
So yeah, it's a little tough to do without visuals, but one thing to say is basically,
you're right, you can always form bonds at the ends, but because these things can form
complex structures, sometimes the business ends can be somewhere else.
They can be buried in the middle, let's say, of the big Lego structure.
You could say like the inside of the Lego structure is actually hollow, and that's
where all the electrons are hiding.
And if molecules can get into that hollow part, then they can make bonds and form bonds
and stuff like this.

Memo: So the size and shape also plays a part in that.

## 4: Complexity and Dynamics in Biological Systems
Alec: Totally.
And this is really what allows biology to be so complex, because not only can I take
the same red Lego, blue Lego, green Lego, stack them all together, but I can change
their order.
And if I do that with hundreds of thousands of Legos, you can imagine that you get many,
many different permutations of sequence, and each unique sequence can actually fold into
a unique structure.
And then actually, what's really crazy is in some cases, the structure is actually dictated
by the environment, which means if I let the Lego sit, like if I took all of those Legos
in a particular order, like red, green, blue, red, green, blue, over and over again, it
would automatically fold into some big cylinder.
But then if I did the same thing in, let's say, oil, it'll fold into a totally different
structure.
So it's not only the fact that there's interactions between all of the Legos themselves, but it's
also the fact that they're in a cellular environment, in an environment that actually pushes them
into a structure.
And this structure then allows them to do a function, which is one of the most remarkable
things, that these things ultimately do fold into a structure time and time again, and
then they can do all of this chemistry that is necessary to promote biology.
All from the fact that it's governed purely by physical law, saying that it's of lower
energy cost to go down this hole to basically make a bond.
And then when you break a bond, you release a bunch of energy so you can do work somewhere
else.
So the principle of making and breaking bonds is all dictated by the energy that's described
by physics, but ultimately leads to this really complex life forms, obviously.

Memo: So just to conclude the whole group, what is so special about amino acids and proteins?
I know you almost literally kind of explained by saying it's the shape, but is there anything
else to say other than what you said to explain the properties of amino acids and how they
form proteins?

## 5: The Unique Role of Amino Acids and Proteins in Biology
Alec: Sure.
Sure.
So yeah, so I do have a tendency to rant or meander, so always feel free to just come
in.
But yeah, I mean, the real special property is that the protein, at least proteins, again,
they're not the only macromolecule that dictates life.
There's DNA, RNA.
There's also tons of small molecules that are more complicated or more simple, but they
do complicated things.
But proteins in particular are particularly masterful at moving protons and electrons
around in a very controlled manner.
And the reason that's important is because anytime you talk about energy, energy exchange,
energy motion, you think about it for your car, for like combustion, or you think about
solar energy, solar panels, or whatever the case may be.
The real question is how do you move energy from one place to another so that it can be
distributed and do work?
And really in biology, that comes down in many cases to how do you move the fundamental
units of charge, protons and electrons, and amino acids, and because they have the ability
to move electrons and protons around and their 3D architectures dictate how they can do that,
that type of control to make and form bonds is what makes them so powerful.
The fact that they can form into a structure and this structure allows them to do unique
reactions, meaning rearrange protons and electrons and move them around in a specific way to
either make new molecules or transfer energy that gives them this unique ability within
the biological, like in nature totally.
So it's this ability to do energy transfer and control how molecules are made and formed.

## 6: The Role of Protons and Their Movement in Biological Processes
Memo: Before seeing what Bess and Frank think about all this, I thought, so there are free flowing
protons?
I thought protons exist in the nucleus or-

Alec: No, no, no, no.
So protons are everywhere and you can think about it like water.
So on water, there's this property known as pH you're probably familiar with, so acidity.
So in your body, which basically has a way of buffering what is the acidity or the level
of acidity in your blood, for example, is all about the balance of how protons are controlled.
So on water, for example, we typically think of two protons, but you can also add a third
proton on and then you get what's called H3O plus.
This is known as a hydronium atom, or you can remove a proton so it's just an oxygen
and a hydrogen and now it's what's called a hydroxide.
And so protons can actually be exchanged, moved around, and many biological processes
are actually driven by the fact that in membranes on cells, there are these things called proton
pumps and what they do is they actually take protons off of molecules or off of water and
then drive protons from one side of the membrane to the other.
Because protons have this positive charge, then on one side of the membrane...

Memo: Actually, they don't take it from the nucleus, right?
Sorry, I...

Alec: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Well, the nucleus is a big and complicated thing, right?
Like in biology, the nucleus is filled with DNA and lots of different things.
No, so we're not talking about that.
We're just talking about water inside a cell, like you can think of it just like a...
The cell is a bag of water, which it's definitely not, it's way more complicated than that,
but you can think about just inside the cell and outside the cell, there's water, right?
And then you can basically change...
There's a pH difference or an acidity difference on the inside and the outside.
And that inside...
All of those protons can be derived from water and there's many different things that control
this, but protons are definitely readily available and we move them around all the time for energy.

Memo: So essentially, then, those molecules are important because they are essential to moving
charges.
That's right.
And charge...
Negative in electron, positive in proton.

## 7: The Importance of Charge Movement and Energy in Life Processes
Alec: Yep.
And the movement of charges to particular locations is what allows life to exist, right?
The controlled motion of energy from one place to another and then that energy's ability
to do work, which are all basic physics principles, right?
I can move things around, I can move energy from place to place, the interactions basically
and how much energy is available in that place dictate how much work I can do.
And that's really what life is about, it's about basically saying, okay, how do I take
this source of energy, like these molecules, oxygen, glucose, whatever the case may be,
and how do I rearrange it so that I can extract the energy from it to do other processes and
do work.

Memo: And just to clarify, there's nothing fundamentally important about the nature of the charge or
anything.

Alec: No, nothing special.

Memo: Because these charges, they just allow different attachments to work or different structures
to come together and that's why...

## 8: Fundamental Role of Energy and Charge in Biological Structures
Alec: That's right.
So there's nothing special about the electrons or protons.
Everything is about how they're being placed in particular locations and how those 3D architectures
we were talking about before make it so you can create what are called like gradients
or ways in which the electrons and protons can flow either into different molecules or
into different locations so that this work can be done.
So nothing special, no magic.

Memo: Yeah, right on.
If there's anything to add, say, any question, please feel free and after you, please write.
Yeah, sure.

Thanks, Memo.

## 9: The Role of Weak Forces like Van der Waals in Biological Systems
D Unknown: Alec, that was a really nice explanation.
I just want to throw in like the Van der Waals force also probably plays in how life actually
is sculpted.
And I think there are some cellular mechanisms that actually employs Van der Waals force
to essentially function, even though that's typically not a bond, but do you consider
that to be like as essential as the ionic bond and the covalent bond that you mentioned?
Because I personally feel like, you know, life is just a composite of all types of chemical
interactions that can be basically employed.
That's basically my question and also like a comment.
I think like it was like a slip of the tongue, but I think you said something like you mentioned
something about polymers and methane and ethane.
So these are alkenes, but polymers can only be formed from alkenes and alkynes, I think.
I'm not mistaken.
But yeah, I just wanted to mention those.

## 10: The Importance of Hydrogen Bonding in Life and Its Complexity
Alec: Sure.
So that's a great point.
So I think maybe to address that clarity, that's the first part about, okay, all I have
to do to define a polymer is to define a monomeric unit.
So that can be some carbon hydrogen unit.
Then once I stack those together, that makes the polymer.
So I could in some cases argue that things like butane or ethane are in fact polymers
depending on how I define the fundamental monomeric unit.
But I definitely agree, like to your point, because that is something that should be clarified.
But I could also define, you know, DNA, which is a nitrogenous base that has nitrogen and
oxygen and then make those the monomeric units and as long as I stack those together.
But you're right.
I was trying to make the illustration that we can take a simple building block, make
copies of it, and then as I make more and more copies of it, I get these long strings
and then these long strings form together.
But to your point and question, yeah, you've actually hit on the thing that I care about
probably the most, but the most complicated thing to convey.
Not necessarily van der Waals forces, but something kind of tangentially related, which
is hydrogen bonding.
Hydrogen bonding, which is how, for example, water can interact through its dipoles.
And these very weak interactions are super important, right?
Covalent bonds are not great in terms of life because, I mean, they are, they're essential
to get these really long lived structures, but they're super stable, right?
They're not going to change.
And life is super dynamic and the ability to move and change spatial organization and
structure all depends on the ability to be weakly interacting.
And like you may be alluding to, right, thermal, this is a big thing from physics, right?
We have to think about how much energy is actually available around us in the environment.
And so for context, right, thermal energy, the energy of the air, the temperature around
us or body temperature even, is not actually that much energy when it comes to bonds being
broken and formed, like it's very, very weak.
So it can't break covalent bonds in the air, right?
So they're super stable because there's not that much thermal energy around to break them.
But hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces, because they're so weak, they can be broken
spontaneously, which allows these complex molecules to undergo rearrangements with the
energy available just in the environment alone.
So I totally agree with you.
And I think that van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds are really critical, but are
very, very difficult to model because they are quantum mechanical in nature.
And so it makes them quite challenging to appreciate, given how difficult it is to already
model the things that we understand relatively well, like covalent and ionic interactions.
But yeah, absolutely.

## 11: The Dynamics of Weak Forces and Their Reversibility
D Unknown: Yeah, I completely agree because like you just mentioned, the activation energy required
to break the hydrogen bond and van der Waals forces are substantially lower.
If you have like some kind of equilibrium in the reaction, it can go both ways.
It can be reversible.
Based on, definitely, you need some additional catalyst and the energy requirement will also
dictate which direction the reaction is going to go, but yeah, that's a great point.

## 12: Van der Waals and Hydrogen Bonding in Quantum Context
Alec: Yeah, yeah, and I think one thing you hit on there, too, is the fact that these things
can be transient and change during the course of the reaction, right, or upon addition of
a catalyst or something like this, where the fluctuation in the strength of these forces
can be higher in the middle of or lower than the thermal energy, which allows them to say
how long can certain structures be stable, which is something I think we don't understand
very well.

Memo: No that was awesome.
So could you say it again, what is that?

Alec: Which part?

Oh, van der Waals.

Memo: Yeah, van der Waals.
That's like a threshold?

## 13: Van der Waals Force as a Weak Interatomic Interaction
Alec: It's like a weak force that allows neutral molecules to actually be attracted to one another,
but it's very, very short range.
So it's like basically when atoms get really close to one another, they'll exhibit this
force on each other, but yeah, it's a very weak force, but it's a kind of attraction
that can occur between atoms that is like a bond, but it's like an interaction.
It's just very weak and transient, and in order to fully describe it, you have to use
quantum mechanics to accurately kind of make a picture.
We can write down equations that approximate it, but it's kind of challenging to describe
what it is without that understanding.
So more or less, it's a weak attractive force between neutral atoms or neutral molecules.

D Unknown: Yes, that's very important that a point that the allergist pointed out, there's the thermal,
the temperature, the thermal energy, not functioning as a reference energy for what happens right
now, which is very crucial in this environment.
I mean, Memo, this is a great room that you're having here right now, and I was just trying
to get more co-hosts to tomorrow's room with quantum photonics, where Alec will be the
presenter.
Apparently, Alec is like a fountainhead that has a lot of information to offer, and I think
this conversation style will be okay, right, with Alec, right, and I mean, if Memo can
make it tomorrow, that'd be great.
You know, please be a co-host if you have time, and seven pieces.

Memo: Yeah, I'll try.
Thank you for saying that.
Yeah, Alec, here's a treasure trove in mind.

Alec: Thanks.
Yeah, yeah, so tomorrow, yeah, we'll talk about some more technical points.
Today was more about, Memo asked about, like, a general discussion, so.

D Unknown: Yeah, if I may, I mean, just make use of this as a warm-up room, and then hope Memo wouldn't
mind.
So maybe I should do a warm-up room like this in the future, yeah, so, I mean, just from
what, you know, this discussion that started by Memo and you that made me understand that
the water environment is actually very relevant, right, so it's by coincidence that the following
week we'll be having a rich sportsman just have the, as the title of, you know, the subject
of the water environment in itself.
I think that will be also, you know, it's a perfect circle to.

Thank you.
And that is, as he said, by asking himself,
along with nobody else, he's got the main reason
behind that dream turning down,
that's what he has, he wanted to tell the story of that
in a more specific way, and have overall control
on the direction of the story,
about balance, escape, and the society
in which he is, the strict directions of that thought.
Yeah, and unfortunately he's still making
the rules about what happen.
We could always lose it if been our pants
at right time if it's all we did, right?
Yes, would be.
We could, it would probably be bad,
we could turn it off from something,
we could imagine he would rule up to this box.
