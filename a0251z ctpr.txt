How does dmt affect the brain ossilations 

Sybapse


Dmt fits into the serotoni receptor 
So jts a serotonkn receptor agonist
And its exciting the brain, increasing brain

So that blocks serotoninexpresses 
Serotonin agonist might speed up the brain rythums in some areas, it might excite the brain

Lsd dmt psilocybin

Reductions in the alpha band, visuall regions, 

Dmt reduce alpha beta, increases theta and delta?

Serotonin have autonreceptors
Auto receptors reduce the firing of serotonin
Takes 2 weeks for auto receptors down regulate

They don't focus on,
Deeply seated firing patterns
Depression might be over activity kf default mode network, rumination

Opiates impair synaptic function which helps maintain the electrical equilibrium of fhe brain stem so that your lungs continue to work
