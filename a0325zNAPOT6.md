a0325z NAPOT 6 (rough draft)

The inspiration for NAPOT 6th Revision came partially from a question some posed to me in reaction to NAPOT 5: 
 
Darren R: "Sadly my attention span can't manage 1h 44m 😞 (to watch the NAPOT 5 video). I did get a couple of minutes in. It's hard to see how qualia, which are physical phenomena, can be created by means so vastly different to the only other means we know to produce them. Imagine that instead of qualia, you were trying to produce a magnetic field. It doesn't matter how fancy your software, you're not going to get the desired result. This idea that you can just abstract away the physical layer like it doesn't matter is like trying to connect to WiFi by doing the calculations with a pencil and paper."

# NAPOT 6: Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography Revision 6

Here in this writing, in my work, and also with the past 200 plus years of neuroscience and other sciences we are finally identifying the exact components of qualia, and specifically which neural correlates become your phenomenologically conscious experience both in terms of what, how and why these neural correlates are transformed into human experience. That is what my work documents. NAPOT starts with a broad examination of how neural signals are passed between neural arrays passed around the whole brain network. To some extent we are identifying the paths of signals and the transformations the signals take at each step from something as small as an atom (a charged ion) to your qualia, to consider how phase wave variations perturb and and create differentiated information from the tonic brainwave oscillations, and how these differentiations are bound together with temporal-spatial oscillations in feedback loops to become the internal representations of things that define your emotions, your thoughts, your whole interior experience of being someone, and your personal sense of reality. In addition this work studies the transformations of the paths signals take, including an exploration of how functional changes in the networks architecture, both short term & long term changes, result in new phenomenological experiences and new behaviors.

The components at each stage are being mapped out in increasing detail, but we don't need to replicate each step perfectly. The analogy given often by others is the comparison between birds and airplanes. If the principles of flight are understood exactly, then we can separate  the essential from the inessential. In other words we can abstract away.

Sidenote: Composability in category theory is a neat way to wrap your mind around the concept that if two functions lead to the same outcome they are isomorphic in effect. This concept is a bridge to another part of this work which is about how we can reproduce phenomenological consciousness in a machine.

*Find that note with the great illustration of synapses, the cell body with spines all over.* 

Think about how at the neural array scale a behavior choice is a configuration in a synaptic pattern on apical dendritic branch and that seeing picture of branches with mushroom shaped spines as a choice configuration, that is the thing, the configuration that your brain, body, and representation of self drive, and can change when you make new choices, what is changing is the synaptic configuration (that is probably on the Apical Dendrite or Exit Terminal)

# Inceptive Field

I redefined a neuron's exit terminal as an Inceptive Field the opposite of a Receptive Field. The inceptive field connects to a neural array or an array of neurons each of which has a receptive field that is not the same as the inceptive field belonging to the neurons that are transmitting to them. In other words Inceptive fields connect to multiple Receptive Fields, they overlap & mix, and in maybe 40-80 percent of the brain they are partially intercepted by Receptive & Inceptive Astrocyte Fields in tripart synapses.

The receptive fields represent learned patterns, and so they are each unique in configuration, but as we learned with the Apical Dendrites, coincident backward propagating potentials to the soma trigger bursting in the soma when combined with basal dendritic inputs. BTSP Behavioral Timescale synaptic plasticity + bidirectional plasticity result in learned patterns that are encoded in the inceptive field of a neuron. The Inceptive field can also be referred to as the presynaptic area, post somatic area, the exit terminal, or the Apical Dendrite, and this area also learns patterns, it learns from the soma bursts in conjunction with bidirectional synaptic activity.

Neural Inceptive Field Study is like the study of Dendritic Computation but focused on the other side of the neuron.

Inceptive Field Study is about examining how the exit terminals, apical dendrites, presynaptic, or post somatic areas also learn and encode patterns both in their connections.

My argument is that Inceptive Field patterns tend to be learned output patterns, or motor patterns. I like to think this is where learned movements, or learned choices are stored in a sparse & distributed way like memories.

Building on the work of Jeff Hawkins in his book A Thousand Brains, and the work of Peter Tse in his book the Neural Basis of Freewill,

I like to think that there is a neural basis, not just for choice, and not just for emotion, but also for muscle movement, muscle learning, and coordinated responses. 

Imagine as a thought experiment that sensory learning was exclusively encoded on the basal dendritic side, and action learning or actions paired with memories were encoded exclusively on the exit terminal or apical dendrite side of a neuron?

It's a thought experiment because in the literature there are actually separate motor neural pathways and separate sensor neuropathways, and the real brain is so messy there is probably a bit of both happening on both sides in most of the brain cells (neurons & glia), but not in equal measure in every place or every cell. Generally speaking there are some identified trends, so we have a motor cortex, and we have dedicated motor neural pathways, but I think it’s fair to say that all brain cells are involved in highly coordinated movement, and that thought itself is a cortical movement activity, no different from motor movement at the neuron scale.

Although emotion is not the main topic of this section I also argue that there is a Neural Basis for emotion, and that emotions, sensory renderings that make up phenomenological conscious experience, and motor outputs all begin as sparse & distributed phase wave differentials communicated between cells at the neuron-glia scale. Then each of these pattern types, sensory, emotion, thinking, and muscle movement scale up into larger phase wave differential patterns initially with bursts that succeed in triggering sharp wave ripples and waves of inhibited neural arrays, and the dominant aggregation of phase wave differential rhythms that persist & have an isomorphic similarity become the phenomenologically conscious experiences of thought, emotion, thinking, and body movement.

The thought experiment, of movement being stored in the Inceptive Field of a Neural Array is useful to consider that a neuron could pair its learned inputs with its learned outputs to activate an action sequence that has been connected to a specific learned memory, or that same neuron.

This thought experiment imagines that our decisions could be compartmentally organized separately from the patterns we learn, and thus changed independently from what we have learned.

If our most complex learned actions were stored in the Apical branches they could be separately reconfigured in the Apical branches via bidirectional synaptic plasticity coupled with learning from the soma, this would allow the basal dendrites to remain tuned into very specific patterns so that what is being paid attention to remains in focus while on the Apical Side new behavior patterns are being encoded.

So I think of the basal dendrite as saying "this is what I learned to recognize" and I think of the apical dendrite side as saying "this is my program for how to respond to this pattern happening"
I think of the separation between the basal & apical dendrites as a separate of learned sensory inputs paired or connected together only via the soma.

This means or could mean that learned & reprogrammable action outputs or comesforth from the apical dendrite side of the equation.

If true I imagine that this sort of physical configuration, this separation of powers, between learned detection (basal) and learned response (apical) allows for a non-linear action response system, where fragments of action patterns can be triggered in any order to create a custom reaction to a custom experience, it's like the actions are SDR Sparse Distributed Representations of Actions, and like a piano they can be activated in any sequence, to produce any kind of result, but the results trend towards & away from learned patterns, as patterns that oscillated previously partially shape & define the patterns that come next, so my past behavior oscillations help coordinate my future behavior oscillations, and I am like this 4th dimensional object, the waves of the past shape the waves of the present and that is how I have coordinated action over time from what is otherwise a bag of brain cells.

The past learned oscillations stored in the network exert an continuously reorganizing & organizing effect on new actions.

My recent thoughts on NAPOT 6 are somewhat distributed across these new notes.

New Note: b0002y.md electron bonds primer, this talk helped me to consider oscillation as both solving the attention binding issue, and explaining how all of our cells act as a collective sensor. This concept, combined with what I learned about Oscillatory Physics from Steven Strogatz’s work and Georgio Buzsaki’s work helped me come up with the concept of Cell based Entification, or how a person becomes an entity from many cells.

https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/b0002y.md

In theory an entire array or group or cluster of neurons & glial cells can be part of a sensor set that transmits to an actor set of cells allowing the principle of action at a single cell to be represented by many cells in what is a functional fractal at a larger scale. Two or more cells bound in oscillation can behave like a single sensor & transmitter system, an observer & actor system.

Given that brain activity is encoded in a feedback loop it is possible for actions to be encoded on the sensor side and sensation memories to be encoded on the action side, in fact with looping signals will synchronize the sensation patterns with the action patterns, the sensation of past action will further modify the next action, action perception cycle

# 2. Sensory Input Qualia & Muscle Output Qualia. Like Memories, Actions are a nonlinear program. Action programming is sparse-distributed like memory. 

“Sparse distributed memory (SDM) is a mathematical model of human long-term memory introduced by Pentti Kanerva in 1988 while he was at NASA Ames Research Center. It is a generalized random-access memory (RAM) for long (e.g., 1,000 bit) binary words. These words serve as both addresses to and data for the memory.”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_distributed_memory

My argument is that The Inceptive Field (defined by the connections from Apical Dendrites and alternatively by the exit terminals of brain cells) may encode learned choices, learned responses, and learn muscle reactions.

The non-linear way that neurons compute reactions to spatially & temporally distinct stimuli allows for a non-linear action response.

As discussed elsewhere neurons accomplish nonlinear computation by being specifically to stimulus from any direction, with special reactions for multiple stimuli in close proximity, such as the stimulation of two NMDA receptors on the same dendritic branch that yields a multiplicative reaction, instead of an additive reaction.

What makes computation non-linear is that it can process the input in any order, from any direction, in that sense there is perhaps some analogy of the brain to functional programming, to entity component systems, and to multiplayer experiences written on 3D game engines.

Yet there are also threshold mechanisms, at every scale, at the atom, ion, molecular & protein scales, in the receptors, in dendrites, in the somas, in the neural circuits, in the cortical columns, and in larger brain networks that require some aggregate of non-linear rhythms to create a linear output, or an orderly sequence of behaviors that can react to non-linear inputs.

This article (below) is relevant to both sensory qualia and muscle qualia.
# Membrane Voltage Dynamics of Parvalbumin Interneurons Orchestrate Hippocampal Theta Rhythmicity 
"Hippocampal network activity at theta frequencies (5-10Hz) is important for behavior. However, it remains unclear how behaviorally-relevant network theta rhythms arise and interact with cellular dynamics to dictate spike timing. We performed membrane voltage (Vm) imaging of individual CA1 pyramidal cells and parvalbumin interneurons with simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings in mice during locomotion. We found that Vm theta rhythms organize spike timing in both cell types regardless of behavioral conditions, but the Vm of parvalbumin interneurons is better synchronized with LFP. The temporal relationships between spikes and LFP theta reliably reflect the Vm-LFP relationships in parvalbumin cells, but not in pyramidal cells. Thus, cellular theta rhythms broadly organize spike timing in CA1 neurons, and parvalbumin interneurons are critical in coordinating network theta rhythms."

# 3. What makes it conscious?
Not all of our sensory inputs are conscious and not all of our motor outputs are conscious. We have a high level coarse-grained computationally rendered internal representation, that manifests a multi-sensory metaphor of reality, so only the aggregate of a great number of isomorphic or self-similar phase wave differentials reach attention in our phenomenological conscious experience, those things that are perceived consciously are the dominant phase wave differential rhythms.

Those muscle movements that are conscious are also phase wave differential rhythms, and the choices that we make are also the dominant phase wave differential rhythms that bridge conscious rendered sensory input experience (think of it as the experience of the ecosystem) and conscious rendered muscle output (think of it as the experience of the body)

Sensory Input Qualia I consider to be a set of distinct oscillating isomorphic phase wave differentials, above a certain threshold of activity persistence, existing as a well defined pattern of activity in the brain that is resonating away in time, dissipating, or noising away (with the analogy of Stable Diffusion Neural Networks) into the synchronous tonic low information brainwave oscillations that I argue are the neural correlates of the experience of the feeling of being someone.

Actions are a nonlinear program - Conjecture: because neurons have the ability to detect spatial patterns, and they have the ability to emit spatial patterns, the active synaptic configuration of the apical dendrite could be considered an action pattern, and the programming language for an action is a nonlinear activation of learned action sequences that oscillate together.

My argument is that actions are nonlinear coded responses, meaning that action sequences can be triggered in any order to customize a new action sequence that is paired to a novel experience.

In essence, just as Qualia are a set of distinct oscillating isomorphic (similar) phase wave differentials, above a certain threshold of activity persistence (that resonate away in time) so are actions. In other words Actions are Muscle Output Qualia.

sparse distributed representations
sparse distributed memory prediction renderings
sparse distributed learned action sequence modules
sparse distributed phase coupled action components
Sparse distributed actions bound into dominant oscillatory rhythms become executed sequences of behavior, coordinating muscle movements, formulating planned actions, embodying pre-planned contingency adaptive prioceptive motor output.

like memories: each component of an action is stored in the synaptic configuration 

I like to imagine that actions are learned by the postsomatic side of a neuron, ala the presynaptic side of the synapse (the Apical Dendrite or Exit Terminal). In other words the inceptive fields encode the actions or outputs creating learned memories from the Soma in association with bidirectional synaptic communication. 

I can (metaphorically) count the pixels in my minds eye, there are trillions of them (synapses) (heterogeneous synaptic plasticity is analogous to individually modified pixels on a tv screen)
However my argument is not that we have a conscious representation of all the synaptic outputs, but rather my argument is that we have a high level course grained representation consisting of the aggregate of or the spatially & temporally distributed sum, product & remainder of all the phase wave differential rhythms. The phenomenologically conscious experience of redness is not just a phase wave differential when it’s conscious, it is a dominant phase wave differential rhythm, consisting of many sparse & distributed components, represented by synaptic frequency states, as well as dendritic, somatic, and apical states, that achieve dominance in mental representation though a combination of regional connections via synchrony to establish a looping neural pathway, and a persistence of isomorphic or self similar tempo spatial signal patterns. In other words it’s both the active neural pathway, defined by the phase states in brain cells, and the dominant signal waveforms aka the persistent phase wave differential rhythms that formulate the material of phenomenological conscious experiences as we experience them.

Synaptic Efficacy is locally heterogeneous (meaning diverse) meaning that synapses are individually upregulated or down regulated. Like Pixels on your tv screen. Pixels observed by other dendrites.

NAPOT 6 Refines the idea of NAPOT to consider that Synaptic inward EPSPs and Somatic outwards EPSPs specifically increase the brightness or loudness or hardness or distinctiveness of our phase wave representations in our minds. Essentially EPSP an increasing brightness in the mental pixels of our qualia aka our internal representations. When ESPS increase, something visual, acoustic, tactile, or other internal representation increases in contrast. That doesn’t mean that every Synaptic change is conscious. Synaptic frequency state changes can also be imagined as like pairs of speakers & microphones, or pairs of television pixels & eyes, but with the tonic oscillation there isn’t anything notable passing through the synapse, and for a signal pattern passing through synapses to be notable to the human mind it has to be recurrent in either space or time, resonating, reverberating, like a rhythm, or a burst, a rhythm or burst that leads to a ripple that is dominant in loudness or novelty compared to other brain signal patterns.

I think if I take this idea one step further it’s that bidirectional synaptic communication, dendritic computation, and somatically detected coincidences help to define which sensory input patterns are ignored and which sensory input patterns gain dominance in the brain’s oscillatory rhythms.

# 4. Lets begin to imagine machine applications of phenomenologically conscious functions
Lets imagine the oscillatory neural pathway being simulated in a machine, we are simulating the microscopic, which is taking discrete phase changes, and passing them through simulated signal pathways, through a network that results in state phase changes to the network. What makes them phase wave differentials conscious then? My argument is that they become dominant rhythms when they become conscious. DPWDR Dominant Phase Wave Differential Rhythms. If an engram is a phase wave differential from baseline tonic brainwave activity, a phenomenologically conscious engram is a dominant phase wave differential rhythm (that persists spatially and or temporally over other phase wave differentials in the brain).

It's like what if you arranged a diffusion network in a loop to take the incoming data, render something, feed the rendering back to the diffusion network to render something else and kept repeating that process, so that the eventual output was this really complex consideration.

The network is learning sequences of spatial transformations, if you can tie its results into a reinforcement neural network so that it can link its own renderings of a game to its results in the game then you have tied the renderings that it makes to itself with its actions in the game, and that is what I am arguing is analogous to what organisms with their brains are doing

If we know that oscillating magnetism is used to bind information in feedback loops into a reality that the network can use to perceive reality, itself, and its surroundings, but that it amounts to an internal rendering that the organism references as a map to its own genetic goals including survival & reproduction and we have a way of achieving the same outcome without magnetic oscillations but with simulated magnetic oscillations, then we can achieve the same result, a being that has an internal sense of reality, that it can reference and be driven from the same way as we have an internal sense of reality that we can reference and be driven from.

In other words I react to what I perceive, and I don't react to what I don't perceive, and a robot based on this technology will be the same way. Reacting to what it is perceiving, and not reacting to what it does not perceive.

From one valid perspective we can consider the whole brain as a vast sensor transmitter relay system, with phenomenological consciousness being like a hall of mirrors for oscillatory tomography (Oscillations that are similar bind together, like coincidences, that is the basis of oscillatory tomography or tomography via oscillation) to bind together synaptic & somatic patterns that result in motor outputs that the same sensor transmitter system then recaptures to build a self aware identity, a strange loop in space.'

If you are one of the 60 or so people on this planet smart enough to be excited about Self Aware Networks and Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography then stay tuned for NAPOT 7, although by comparison NAPOT 7 is Expert Level, and I would describe NAPOT 6 as Advanced.

"Externally generated events may act as an alignment event by resetting the phase of internal rhythms as they directly interfere with the neural activity in the respective sensory areas, or by resetting attentional dynamics. Conversely, examples of internally generated events are motor acts like an arm movement (Tomassini et al., 2015), a button press (Benedetto et al., 2016) or an eye movement (Bellet et al., 2017; Benedetto and Morrone, 2017). Internally generated events may also act as an alignment event by resetting neural rhythms, either through a corollary discharge, i.e., an efferent copy of the movement plan sent by motor areas, or through the generation of new sensory inputs, e.g., the retinal movement during a saccade. Alternatively, or additionally, a motor action may act as an alignment event by revealing an internal rhythm, if the motor act is produced with some preference for a particular phase of that rhythm."

"Growing evidence suggests that traveling waves are functionally relevant for cognitive operations in the brain. Several electroencephalography (EEG) studies report on a perceptual alpha-echo, representing the brain response to a random visual flicker, propagating as a traveling wave across the cortical surface. In this study, we ask if the propagating activity of the alpha-echo is best explained by a set of discrete sources mixing at the sensor level rather than a cortical traveling wave. To this end, we presented participants with gratings modulated by random noise and simultaneously acquired the ongoing MEG. The perceptual alpha-echo was estimated using the temporal response function linking the visual input to the brain response. At the group level, we observed a spatial decay of the amplitude of the alpha-echo with respect to the sensor where the alpha-echo was the largest. Importantly, the propagation latencies consistently increased with the distance."

"Schaffer collaterals are axon collaterals given off by CA3 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus.

It is one of the most studied synapses in the world and named after the Hungarian anatomist-neurologist Károly Schaffer."
"Moreover, Schaffer collateral axons develop excitatory synapses that are scattered over the dendritic arborization[3] of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.[4] In the early stage of long-term potentiation, Schaffer collaterals release glutamate that binds to AMPA receptors of CA1-dendrites. The process of developing a network of CA3-to-CA1 recurrent excitatory glutamatergic synapses alters the frequency of spontaneous action potentials in Schaffer collaterals. By adulthood, CA3 recurrent network activity is reduced, the frequency of spontaneous action potentials is decreased in Schaffer collaterals, and a single release locus synapse with one dendritic spine on a given CA1 pyramidal neuron can be developed by Schaffer collateral axons.[2]"

"Widespread, perception-related information in the human brain scales with levels of consciousness"
"Here, we provide evidence for a novel organizational concept: we uncover task-specific information distributed across the human brain. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based decoding models to probe the presence of task-specific information. In doing so, we show that brain regions that are empirically almost entirely task-independent (considered to be “noise”— i.e., t-statistics ≈ 0—in standard univariate fMRI analyses) can decode various tasks, even without statistical learning tools. Thus, task-specific information is present and readily accessible throughout the neocortex, challenging the sensitivity of traditional linear, univariate analytical approaches. Remarkably, even subcortical structures and the cerebellum contain task-specific signals in voxels that would univariately be considered “noise”. Finally, using data from an auditory study with different levels of sedation, we show that the widespread signal in regions remote from the primary and secondary sensory cortices (auditory cortex) depends on the level of sedation, suggesting the brain’s widespread, task-specific information is related to perception rather than the encoding of the sensory stimulus. Our analysis uncovers task-specific and consciousness level-dependent information across the human brain, which we hypothesize to be the basis for coherent, subjective perceptions.``

"Disentangling Temporal and Rate Codes in Primate Somatosensory Cortex"
"However, the respective roles of spike timing and rate in frequency coding are confounded because vibratory frequency influences both perceived pitch and magnitude and shapes both the timing and rates of S1 responses. To disentangle these various elements, we measured S1 responses as animals performed a vibratory frequency discrimination task, in which differences in frequency were accompanied by uninformative variations in amplitude. We then assessed the degree to which the strength and timing of S1 responses could account for the animals’ ability to perform the frequency discrimination task in the presence of intensity confounds. First, we showed that animals can discriminate frequency, but their performance is biased by vibratory amplitude. Second, rate-based representations of frequency are susceptible to changes in amplitude, but in ways that are inconsistent with the animals’ behavior, calling into question a rate-based code for frequency."
