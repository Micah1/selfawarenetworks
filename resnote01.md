What I see is oscillation, specifically the physics of how oscillation works, as a conceptual model linking the physics of the cosmos at all scales, from atoms to galaxies, to human thought to genes and ideas. I was startled for a moment when he mentioned tomography as being a sort of opposite concept to an atom, tomography in his mind is dissecting reality, while the atom is a building block for the evolution of reality, I think he is close to seeing how the concept of oscillatory tomography, or he might describe it as inverse oscillation tomography is in a sense a unifying principle of organization and computation in biology at different scales so that genes, proteins, cells, groups of cells, cortical columns, activity between brain regions, and whole brain activity in coordination with the body can be understood as a simultaneous construction & deconstruction with the physics of oscillation.

I think the principles of oscillation extend into the physics of the universe and into artificial intelligence in the sense that the development of a pattern is a process of connection forming between spatially or temporally coincident abstractions.

My thinking about where we should go with our collaboration is connected more with Michael Levin's recent work where he talks about Agental Patterns, or the idea that patterns become agents that drive behaviors.

My opinion is that we ought to collaborate with Michael Levin, or at least incorporate his work into our collaboration as a talking point.

In particular I appreciate that your level of abstraction is perhaps scale invariant, instead of only bridging neural networks & symbolic AI, your work (Michael Miller) we could also bridge biological computation at different scales, describing proteins as agents that interact, or describing the interaction of cortical columns and other brain regions, and this are in particular is where I was thinking to go with our collaboration.

In particular the dynamic "functional connectivity" between brain regions, from neural oscillatory phase coupling, is a very obvious mechanism for the future of robotics.

In addition to Michael Levin's work, I think we can incorporate a discussion of Earl K. Miller's work as he focuses on large scale cross brain phase coupling between different frequency bands, such as with his discussion of Beta waves from the PFC driving anti-correlated Gamma Waves, illustrating a mechanism for an organism to have top down control over it's internal patterns, and external behavior patterns.

Building on this quote a little "I think the principles of oscillation extend into the physics of the universe and into artificial intelligence in the sense that the development of a pattern is a process of connection forming between spatially or temporally coincident abstractions." Abstractions that within the mind are phase wave differentials, or differences. Patterns encoded with spatially & temporally coincident differences become agents driving behaviors, and at some scale they become selves, or identities, persons.
