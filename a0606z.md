Neural Network Cosmos

I like the idea that the universe is a neural network. It's a cool idea. It's probably close to the truth, but I also have a good argument for why the neural network cosmos is not conscious everywhere all the time. 1. is that you are not conscious everywhere all the time, 2. your brainwaves fall into powerbands, the whole spectrum of possible brainwave frequences is not activity, just certain powerbands, certain frequency ranges with names like alpha, beta, theta, delta, gamma, high gamma, etc... There is nothing inbetween alpha & beta, I mean frequences CAN go in between, but they trend toward the center of the power band. It's just like wave/particle physics, and the measurement problem is one well known example of how 

Hebb: Assemblies
Hebb believed that multiple neurons could learn patterns as a group, but the same principle of Hebbian learning could apply to the receptors on a single cell, because the combined pattern representation could be represented by the summary configuration of the receptors that developed in response to some signalling that the cell received, so it grew more receptors which represent a learned pattern, but now any of the receptors could activate the rest of them, a learning pattern isomorphic to Hebb's multi-neuron assemblies but on a single cell.

I feel like I need a sort of external nervous system to help me keep track of everything

What are cells, a clock, a computer, a processor, a sensor, transmitter, dissipative system
what can they sense

Cells as oscillating clocks: Jon Lief, Steven Strogatz, György Buzsáki

I will go out on a limb & argue that they (small organisms from crabs to insects) are probably all experience some version of pain, even without nociceptors because 1. pain is just part of the signal frequency spectrum 2. there are broad enough similarities between brain structures across species.

the emphasis should be on the arrows instead of the boxes, ie on cell communication, not on what one brain area does vs another

Integrating everything into a narrative
what are the points?

What Lief shows is not just that cells communicate but also that the entire body is linked from blood cells to organs from tcells to neurons to microglia to molecules like Mtor

if we compare modern knowledge to donald hebbs work it means that communication of cell assemblines result in the entire body being a distributed information sensing transmitting structure
receptors are formed to detect specific information patterns that identify physical structures and this is linked to unlocking some programmed reaction from a cell

the entire body functions as a chemical neural network, with each cell being a feature learning node, functioning as a programmed cpu that can reprogram its own program, well at least some cells can reprogram themselves like t-cells, but also cells program other cells like teacher t-cells. and cells pooling receptor data to produce a response

cells function as CPUs, with clock cycles, operations, the functions are 3D receptors and the signals transmitted between cells that build, delete, repair, copy, save, all the functions of the body

but these individual cells pool signal data from multiple receptors for a complex response that is a measurable response to what happened.
