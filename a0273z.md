"Glia Regulate the Development, Function, and Plasticity of the Visual System From Retina to Cortex"
"Visual experience is mediated through a relay of finely-tuned neural circuits extending from the retina, to retinorecipient nuclei in the midbrain and thalamus, to the cortex which work together to translate light information entering our eyes into a complex and dynamic spatio-temporal representation of the world."
"In the zebrafish retina Müller glia have become an important subject of study following observations that they can act as late-stage progenitor cells that can functionally repopulate damaged retina in adult fish (Bernardos et al., 2007), something that is not normally possible in the adult mammalian retina despite a high degree of similarity in structure and function (Karl et al., 2008). This work has started to identify promising avenues for restoring function in the damaged mammalian retina as the transcription factor Ascl1 has been shown to be upregulated in Müller glia in the retina of zebrafish following injury and to mediate the regeneration of retinal tissue; while importantly, no such expression of Ascl1 occurs in mammals following retinal damage (Karl et al., 2008)."
"Encouragingly, it has been shown that when Ascl1 is overexpressed in Müller glia in mice, along with an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, retinal regeneration is possible following injury suggesting a potential avenue to induce retinal regeneration in mammals (Karl et al., 2008)"
