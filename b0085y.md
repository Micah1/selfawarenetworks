Because of functional life, some workers.

00:11

The patterns can be and faceobok can be compared to other patterns.

00:22

Thinking me collected a different sizes.

01:01

So, I mean, this is I can, is that I can compare patterns of different scales in my mind, because,

01:11

Their functional isomorphism.

01:20

Can reduce patterns of any scale down to the down to

01:31

Into basically, like,

01:37

It makes it makes a pattern into a Vauxhall. It makes it, you can scale pattern to any size. So you can compare large patterns and small patterns simply because the functional isomorphism or the the the the difference in the change between one, one stage of the pattern and the next stage of the pattern can be.

02:16

Can be easily compared to another pattern. In terms of the the changes in scale, sorry the changes in relative scale between functions. So you have a pattern that has that is about planets and stars and it can be like a pattern that's about the the different different scales between stars and planets and in terms of like, what is the frequency of

03:11

Of planets of a certain size with planets of a certainness with stars of certain size and and a certain order. If there is one anyway and you can compare that to numbers for example, say well as the planet is a six and a star is a 60 and you're just basically assigning a number to the geometry, but it's like to be more general.

03:51

It's it's like if you saw a a sequence basically that let's say that, let's say that first some weird reason

04:12

Sure. That was number and had a size of n. Often the say that the starter had a size, then has an average of of three, three planets. And then, as far as size of x typically has no planets, okay? If somehow you you plot it out, you know, a representation of what that pattern is.

04:48

If you were able to then look on looking the ocean and find out some weird pattern about about eggs by the distribution of of large eggs. My certain species where you have you know species is a certain size then they're going to have a certain number of eggs and MV species is another certain size and they have different age.

05:24

I'm literally brainstorming a stupid example of comparing to patterns of different scales and discovering that there's a functional isomorphism between them, some sort of like, you know, if it's actually really bad example. But the point is that, if you had two sequences like, let's say that, say, if you Fibonacci sequence applied at the, and a large scale, and then again, at a smaller scale,

06:15

You can compare that in your mind like the pattern occurring at large skin, that's most count or the pattern occurring, functionally, instead of like physically,

06:31

Any products to think about this, okay? So the question is, where is perception happening? Is it happening in the neurons? Or is it happening?

06:48

And between them trying to remember.

06:56

Oh, so now it's

07:05

So then, so the neuron is only receiving the

07:15

Frequency from the Neurotransmitter or it's only receiving the phase change and each of its synapses and a phase changes instructed to and instruct us and give the synapse instructions. I want to do next or some sort of rule. It's an absence follow as far as what they do if they receive different types of signals.

07:47

Some signals, tell them to open some of the clothes, some to be removed and send to be added. Another ones that are added with the long-term ones.

08:04

That that you reason, that could be the result of, of simultaneous signals being attracted to each other because they're simulating each other because they're simulating each other's growth. In other words a stimulus signal a scent is broadcast outwards. Now, that's stimulus signal could be

08:35

Could be a combination of the disturbance in the electromagnetic field.

08:47

Right. That is spread, so then they're on crates, the action potential. That's like it is now going to resonate in the electron in the electric field and the magnetic field and the mechanical field. The mechanical as a mechanical wave and that vibration is going to resonate.

09:25

Through three glial connection across to another neuron. It's also connected via clip legal connection. So you're gonna have a mechanic mechanical waves and electric waves and

09:50

Magnetic words that there are they are at least in part going to travel from a neuron to a glio cell and maybe in then to to another neuron and so through like a combination of physical shaking and electromagnetic shaking neurons are gonna vibrate at the same time and then that it's like receiving a stimulus to grow and interaction of a stimulus.

10:25

And so you're going to have dangerous growing towards each other, but it's possible that there's so much sort of with Android to grow 
towards each other. That could be symbolically like.

10:47

Type of isolation called, I mean a type of oscillation pattern that causes synchronization and when when you have a DC organization when you so that would be long-term potentiation when nerds physically wire together. After, after the spines grow but long-term depression means that the the physical connection between those neurons breaks apart.

11:25

And you could categorize that as a as a display state or an anti-phase state. So basically that is like, you know, the space date would be an oscillatory state, where the synchronization between two signals instead of being closest together is now. The farthest apart. And so, his playstate would work disassociate two neurons that had previously linked together.

12:07

It would destroy a long-term memory and and that could be helpful if you if you had the facts wrong in the first time and you need to update that on your mind and you realize that, you know, A and B are not actually connected together. Like you thought when you saw the new piece of evidence that shed light on the real pattern in which a is not connected to be and so you had to see in order to change your memory something the physical connections and and that from the pattern, that is the basis of your long-term memory of the structure of a real pattern that you're observing.

12:59

The the inner pattern that the synapse is represent, has a change and that means that some new connections are formed and those connections are basically become. They become the synchronized firing stimulates dangerous to grow between them and DC. When I is and a desynchronized firing pattern.

13:37

Would be.

13:42

Basically like a pattern that leaves to a state or else. So what I'm saying is that LTD and LTP are both accomplished with also Tory signals, and also it's for a signal, the oscillatory. Coupling and decoupling is basically like accomplished either through the mutual stimulation, or Hey, and also Tori is placed a which accomplishes like a stimulation frequency pattern and which is weird.

14:41

It's almost like,

14:52

Yeah, I guess it's just an oscillatory decoupling.

15:03

So, so

15:10

Yeah, over time if you get each of each each version of the pattern to

15:18

Fire a different times fire, really it opposite times. That's that's the keys. They have to know if they fire almost. If one, if going one fire is the others. Inhibited. And when the other fire is the other ones inhibited, maybe that's maybe that's it. Then they become decoupled if one gets inhibited by the other fires because it's like sending a signal out.

15:50

And not finding match, not not finding, they

16:00

Second at one point. Yes. So the inhibition is like at one point. The so yeah. So, it could be that and inhibited neurons are possibly creating display states, with, with neurons that they were previously. Thanks to. And that means that inhibitions

16:40

That happened inhibitions that are timed to. Let's say that you have two neurons that learn to fire together across the brain. And let's say that now, a different neuron on one side of the brain, learns to learn is that it needs to fire and especially with it with a different pattern, it updates to the head, it other pattern you synchronize with.

17:11

So if the representation of pattern changes then that may require a different firing sequence and a different inhibitory sequence. And the different inhibitory sequence is part of how that pattern decouples from some of his previous associations and couples with and couples to make new associations. So in one sense as that as that pattern rickshaws around the brain, it's going to be decoupling with with some learned patterns and coupling with other alert patterns.

17:59

And as the process of LTD happening as a pattern ricochets around the brain and and by rickshawing, I mean that it is being identified of this in apps level and projected to an array. And then that array is going to amplify the pattern, my by having the cells in that array respond by either becoming activated or inhibited and the, the inhibited cells are going to be decoupled from, or they're going to be accomplishing decoupling from from cells that are firing at the same time at that, at that point in time across the brand.

18:56

So, let's say that you have cells one through four and in the array. Because if it's not a set of all a set of all cells in a ray, that's a space between one and, and two thousand, okay? Any exit terminal. So, if that could be connected, parameter, cell could be connected to up to 200,000 other neurons, right?

19:17

So, let's say that you have, you know, 25% of these 200 of the 200x terminal array. And it is a sorry we need this particular representation okay so we're just going to have a like a small number of cells fire. So maybe, maybe we need 6. We need like I was gonna say we need six set of 200 to fire in order to create a spicy.

19:49

Striped representation right here, maybe it's six, I don't know. It could be higher lower places. It's a small number. And so. So in a sense, the raise temporary representing the pattern of one neuron plus.

20:19

A pattern of one neuron plus the pattern of several other neurons because so that neuron in terms there is an x terminal and I'm just connected to one neuron. Oh no, wait a second. Now, with this synapse. So okay.

20:46

So, the exit terminal at the very least, external is the receiving setup. So that is a unique array. So that. So that one, there's a unique next terminal provides a unique array and then that array itself which is represented in synapses is going to store the distributed form of the synaptic memory, right?

21:16

Exit terminal, right?

21:22

And now, so the same neurons are receiving multiple arrays, right? So if you think about, okay, so now you have multiple arrays, going to the same. Now, so what I'm imagining is like, So there's like let's say there's a roast beers are representing different neurons, that are indexed terminal and then there's a row, another row.

21:52

And then there's a columnist. Okay, so there's a row of spheres that run horizontal. And then a columnist here is around vertical. Okay? Now, the roast fears, it runs horizontal that represents that represents the the different neurons that are firing or being inherited and the row, the column of neurons.

22:26

That's this vertex, that's running vertically. That represents the the neurons that are in this in that represents the synapses of the external and the neurons behind those synapses. So we're presuming that. Let's say that if you go back to the horizontal row of neurons, which just imagine as a sphere, okay?

22:56

So a horizontal rose spheres in the first sphere that has its own line of projections tag that let's imagine like like, you know, like when you draw a picture of the sun, you draw a circle and then you draw lines going on every direction. Well, in this case, we're going to draw a circle and the lines are going to go from one of the nodes on the horizontal line.

23:26

And so one of the scriptures on horizontal lines of the whole horizontal line consists of spheres that represent neurons that are firing or not firing. And so then the vertical role represents the synaptic connections and the and exothermal. So it's sending it's face. Say the exact same phase date, that it has to each of the neurons and its external.

23:58

So, that is like,

24:07

Right? So, sending that and then when it fires and then when the next neuron fires that is, that is

24:25

When the next neuron fires, the

24:35

Let's say that it is connected to.

24:41

Another column of cells, right?

24:57

But but it's share it but let's say it also let's say that there's so this now we're imagining like two to two hundred thousand columns that correspond to two to 200,000 horizontal spares. So let's say that there's two to 200,000, I said, let's see. This is between two intern of of horizontal spheres and each of them is connected to a set of of of columns.

25:41

All right. Now the colt next huge thing is like, some of the columns it's like okay.

25:51

But it's not, it's really not connected to all the columns.

26:01

Or what I mean is that like So pyramidal cell would be really great at transferring a phase

26:16

State sequence of phase dates of everywhere. It wants because the the pyramidal cells may have just huge extra terminal, right?

26:38

But if all here, the thing is like if if the face states coming out of the external are all receiving the same pattern, right? It's the neurons just communicating. It's phase, then it's up to the

27:03

As like compression. It's like it's like a neuron receiving all of a signals 200,000 signals and then compressing it down to one signal but then distributing that one signal to many different signals, but the only way that becomes a different, a differentiable pattern. Again, as if that one signal, then he comes layered with other signals.

27:36

So you'd have many neurons, right? So let's see that. You have an array and it's as horizontal. And we're I think we're leaving the original drawn but they, they raise like,

27:58

The array is we're talking about what the rate with the array is receiving from. All of the neurons, they're all firing together and each one of them is receiving a pattern. That is a phase state from.

28:21

Face it in each of its synopsis.

28:28

And is tracking the phase date by physically opening closing adding and removing dendrites, synapses science, synaptic science. So it opens or closes, and I have to spines, it opens, synaptic spines and that represents a certain firing pattern. And so the synaptic connections represent the pattern the phase represents the how excited that pattern is, right?

29:12

So, the thing is that the array only receives how excited that pattern is.

29:24

It's not necessarily receiving what that pattern is, just that there is a pattern, that's exciting. It's actually creating a new pattern of excitement. That represents another learned pattern in another project, that makes sense. So it's like the the excitement has, what the the excitement of one particular pattern has been functionally reduced to

30:07

So one learned pattern has been reduced to like an LED light is by or not or brighter, or brightest or dark, it's sorry. The LEDs like the time fine would be like, it's just light is on and then the physical is the lightest bright or writer.

30:33

And then,

30:39

So that, that is going to basically

30:47

Appear to. It's like a light that appears to. So I'm just like, imagining darkness, like a light, a light appears and there's many eyes in the darkness and these represent. The the array, that's the external, but the, but multiple axis terminals are combined together.

31:15

I guess. So it's like each eye is the receptive. Field of a neuron is it's active synaptic connections, right? And so it needs. So it's it's active synaptic connections are going to be using their owns that it's firing basically with Because tonic firing is going to.

31:53

Form the, I guess I guess it could on fire include could

32:07

I guess if I don't know if if spines are gonna grow which on a fire are not based on the principle of stimulation and but maybe it's that is that spines will grow and a abroad pattern towards it towards, every neuron in the network instead of in a particular direction or it could be that spines are going to grow slightly towards any neuron that fired.

32:40

But if they're taught but they're if they're tonic, then they're growth is going to be weak because the activity rate of growth is going to be lower and a literal sense but maybe stronger in terms of bonding to its community but slower to bond with with noons that are oscillating at higher phase rates.

33:11

So it's really the nerves that are hiring that are firing it faster, phase rates that have that are growing actually growing spine is faster and they're growing spines towards energy stimulus. Where they think energy, we're just like what energy is coming from. Like plants growing towards sunlight and then if neurons are firing DC or nice patterns can or space states and they're going to decouple, um, almost in like the decoupling almost might be like, sort of magnetic, like, you know, how like you have,

34:06

Matt, you know how, like if you have, like, magnet dust or pieces of metal that form between magnets, that you know, they become attracted to the to The oil opposed of the of the magnet. And, but they form. But the dust forms like this floating change, or this stem, right?

34:33

Like a magnetic entry just consisting of dead materials though. Think, I think of that as like a spine, like magnetic dust that links together.

34:54

Synchronized firing because the synchronized firing might be attractive. Like like,

35:08

I say let's it has out of magnets. Working it opposite. The track or same interacts. Here. Okay, so in magnetism it is definitely. Opposites attract. So North Poles are attracted to South Poles so or with the brain we're thinking of ostatory coupling, it's not a magnetic event.

35:51

Yeah. So there's there's that. It's stimulation event.

35:59

Stimulation and growth. The neuron because it's firing faster is growing faster. It's activity is faster. It's or basically like the pace of its growth has been accelerated. It's doing stuff. It's more active, and the and it's going to grow. We're where it's receiving stimulation and it's going to be receiving simulation from other nerf from other neurons that are firing simultaneously or firing within a close firing pattern.

36:35

And and so, I'm like, I'm just imagining as a sequence of neurons plays out like, the first neurons, where we connect to the neurons in the second stage, and the mirrors in the second stage or form connects us to their owns in the third stage, in the third stage of the fourth stage.

36:51

And so you're so sequences of neurons can be established. Be cut with close firearm. Synchrony by growing towards the simulation that each is providing at each step, so growing dendrites towards each stimulation signal and the stimulation signal could be received. Electrically magnetically through mechanical vibration or just through the increased transmission of neurotransmitters.

37:31

But in the case of, but then in the case that, you know, we have to solve for well, what, if there aren't any neurotransmitters between tuna neurons? How does, how does it receive a signal to grow a neurotransmitter? And that sense a signal has to propagate without a neurotransmitter in order to establish an air transmitter.

37:59

And so I'm saying, that's where that's where a mechanical vibration, a magnetic signal, and and/or, an electric signal. Could so the mechanical signal, the mechanical electric and vibrations like I might travel over the, the glial cells between the neurons. And but then that tells and that tells them to grow together.

38:36

So they certainly all cells are going to be essential for establishing long-term potentiation and long-term depression, which I believe is consistent with literature. So you're going to have to have the glial cell to transfer all, you know, the stock could transfer also chemicals. Synapses. So and that is interesting because if you had since a gliosa sort of like has to be involved in in creating new LTP, there could be a magnetic process because the the two neurons might be creating a positive signal and the glial cell connection between them might be or probably would be negative by comparison.

39:38

And so, the two positive signals would be attracted to the same glial network. All right, magnetically. The same class. I'm magnetically because they would both be sitting positives to a negatively charged grill.

40:02

Sound. And so a magnetic connection could form between one negative glial and two positive neurons. Magnetically, positive and but yeah, so the could be, but then, but then with that with that suggest is that the the link with the link through the glial network could be magnetic or electromagnetic and mechanical

40:43

Or it just could be the chemical synapse. But but I like the that idea of mechanical waves traveling through the to mechanical on electromagnet waves, traveling through legal network between neurons.

41:07

Establishing links long-term links, so the neuron can basically function as a so the glucose function as it as a pattern transmitter that forms between neurons that forms long term connections and or decouples long-term connections and a very specific way. That's a lot more like like a direct wiring pattern.

41:43

Like,

41:47

A dead transmission between neurons and the chemical transmission between neurons can be, can be described as a way of

42:01

Creating pattern fields. And the pattern field is in the dendrite and that if it's the dendritic sinus synapses of other dentry that is receiving a signal, that's where the pattern feel is. And then what creates a pattern, what propagates of a reduced pattern or a sparse pattern. So there was so the the denture that fires represents just one of the, okay?

42:45

So you have a whole array and the whole range, you hold like, let's say, what's called the two or M2 or S2 or whatever. If this it's it's not it's not the first level of the cortex. It's the second level of the cortex. And so this array is like it consists of multiple so, okay?

43:18

So imagine that there's their dendrites. This, there's dendritic synapses represent, multiple arrays and then the, but what we're doing is, we're taking the pattern that each neuron is learning. And we're turning it into a, an LED light. And so the idea is that the LED light by itself doesn't contain much information.

43:51

But if you have us, if you have a string of neurons that are each contributing so it's like seeing them around. So, you have multiple LED lights that are appearing to many different neurons simultaneously in DV2 area. So, many different LEDs from V1 are appearing in B2, or out to, it's just layer 2.

44:27

So many different neurons and layer 1 are their their it sees a pattern and it reduces that pattern to a light. But there is another neuron in the in the basically it reduces it to a light that is collected by but it's seen by many different neurons. And so you have many lights that are simultaneously seen by many different neurons.

45:05

And so the whole array is so well. A single neuron is not is reducing a pattern to a single to a single output change. Single phase change, right? You have many neurons or creating many phase changes simultaneously. And so you have a whole array of phase changes happening so well I didn't write represents one pattern.

45:35

It is basically, you know, collectively working with the entire with its entire layer to, to produce a collective pattern, which represents are reduced representation of what the previous layer learned. Or maybe it's a a transformed representation of what the previous layer learned. So the layer is receiving a pattern and then it transforms a pattern for another layer to perceive a pattern.

46:18

And then that layer transforms that pattern for another layer to perceive the pattern and it's like so, so each layer is receiving, the pattern is receiving a pattern and then transforming the pattern. And the organization of of patterns is going to develop to represent the key features at of learned patterns because the key features are basically what are going to emerge when you take the whole pattern and you reduce it to, it's sparse is configuration.

47:05

It's bar. Cyst configuration and the process of a dendrite, receiving a signal, and then transmitting a phase signal, the process of a whole array of dendrites doing that. The same thing is the result is is the resulting basically higher level pattern recognitions at each at each stage of the process.

47:34

Like it's is creating a sparse representation of the pattern and then magnifying that sparse representation.

47:47

To the next layer. So you have patterns are changing and in scale, so it's like you have. So again that goes back to like yet. Maybe the front, the front, the first layer of the brain is gonna be focused on the most detailed stuff, but the translator the patterns and the patterns that the first layers receiving are going to become reduced here, reducing scale.

48:28

And that allows the reduced representation scales out from detail to a higher level of feature wreck, feature recognition or higher level details. So it strings all the details so it can contain more detail. So each layer and then neural network is magnifying. The scale of detail that it has of the scale of the detailed pattern that has learned.

49:04

So it's integrating the lower level patterns at a higher level and that is like, feature learning and deep learning, I guess I'm I guess it's sort of describing an accidental way semi accidental way. It's that the the reduced representation of neurofiring. The sequence is causing a sort of binding, together of lower level features into high level features at each age, subsequent station of transmission.

49:48

But you can imagine that transmission can flow that you have a raise that are you know you the V won't be too is right. It was is right behind the V1, but you also have so that's that's like the you've raised a raise that are aligned vertically. Within you have arrays, that are aligned, horizontally and arrays.

50:21

That are or, you know, I guess patterns might emerge orthogonally. And there's also says, and there's two court to two to horizontal directions, right? Just sort of like that, you like the X, Y and Z. It's like the X in the Z are both horizontal. Directions one, is she left and right.

51:02

One is in front of you and back and then the y is a, as a vertical direction.

51:11

And then you might also have like, you know, an array could be any set of neurons that's aligned in orthogonal direction. So that could be any any vector along the XYZ grid. That is not lined up with x y and z but could go any direction. So that would be an orthole worth it, orthogonal pattern of array pattern.

51:42

And so I mean I guess that basically so since any neuron could connect any neuron in theory you can have a raise that of we see ignorance that are basically

52:04

Just novel. They just have novel connection pass, right? So they're just like, so they're so the real receptive field is being redefined and the incepted field is when you, when the receptor field compiles, it's it's inputs that it's symbolically like the nodes represent that a pattern has been detected.

52:36

And but I wouldn't what I want to say is like okay. So, if this synapse is are saying that the notes have been detected, how does that translate into representation of them in my mind. And like, where's the observer? And I'm just saying like that is creating a pattern that as being broadcast to an array.

53:04

The array is then broadcasting. It's patterns to other arrays and that the

53:19

The patterns inside have such a high temporal frequency of correlation that as soon as one fires it fades away but in but but many other parts of the brain simultaneously, catch it and then they've been in, they catch it and then they transmit it. And then their transmission is caught by other parts of the brain and then they catch it and transmit it.

53:49

And this process of catching patterns and transmitting patterns.

54:01

Happens in space fast. Enough at a certain pace. That results in a continuous flow.

54:19

Continuous flow of patterns in space that are representing space and representing the what the organism sees and what representing what the organism. Here's and the key thing is that there is a representation of the observer self which is the body of causation which is your your muscles but your but there's no.

What I saying is that there's no separate observer at these patterns are appearing, physically apparent. He's a patterns, are appearing. Physically in an organism's brain and that the patterns are appearing to other cells that are acting in union, sort of like, with they're firing together and maybe they're synchronized firing frick as create some, that aligns, the receptor field involved in of all the neurons temporally.

So, they're all, they're all acting as a single receiver, a single sensor array because they're representations are alliance temporarily, they can all relate to. What one another is detecting. It's a combined detector, and the combined detector, which is an oscillator is going to be receiving the patterns, and then creating its own output immediately, which is in the own set of patterns.

And or those patterns reflect what it has seen touched hurt and felt. And that's, that's like one component of one stage of one interval of time of consciousness. It's a pattern that emerged in space, that affected another, another sensor, array, and the other sensor, array and that creates. So you have this cascade of sensor arrays that are firing off patterns for other sensor arrays and it allows the organism to have the sort of constant array of patterns that are being developed and detected.

By it's own brain. As a as the brain, the brain would function all the us because oscillators can receive patterns from other oscillators the brain functions as a sort of pattern detector and pattern transmitter that were patterns, are fused together and detectors, are fused together, and then detectors and, and, and transmitters, and it's about detectives being used together.

I mean like when they're oscillating together, I I wonder if the boast Einstein condensate principal and it depends on like a laser, like a lasers. If lasers a flight is combined together, it becomes a laser, right? If you get late to oscillate together, It uses together.
