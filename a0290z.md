(oscillat)
I can set an oscillation in my head to remember something, and it will remember a pattern for me, but the memory oscillates in my experience. If you are alone in a dark room, ask yourself to remember a numerical sequence like a phone number, pick the length, but keep it in your memory for several minutes while you do stretches. Think, does the memory of the number oscillate for you, like blinking in and out of existence? the more I think about this the more I realize that all my memories must be oscillating and then I begin to notice them oscillating, I am noticing the size shape, color, and other wavelength attributes, and imaginary physical properties of concepts that were learned with different kinds of sensory representations.
