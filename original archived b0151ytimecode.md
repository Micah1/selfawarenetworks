Global workspace + attention schema scale

Date of Recording was October 9th 2021, an edited version of the file was created on October 27th 2022 but that wasn't the recording date.

Scaling is a key component of intelligence, scaling from memories stored in synaptic connections to the whole brain, and then onward to other people. Scaling is an essential process in human intelligence.

If a memory stored in synaptic connections becomes conscious, it is being magnified with a kind of oscillatory telescope to the whole brain, the pattern embodied by that neuron's morphology ripples from micro to macro.

(this note then links to the map on fractals with medical imagining, to illustrate that the telescopic effect is being found with patterns that repeat in the brain at multiple scales)

b0151y, this starts off feeling like a continuation of b0145y but then starts to dive into the neuron as a multimodal drum (nonlinear sensor) This again discusses attention schema
The irony of Jeff Hawkins declaring that consciousness is not a special sauce is evoked for me listening to this as I am again considering that nonlinearing sensing would effectively allow neurons to detect & respond to special sauces, multi-modal soups of neural signals, as long as they had the right receptors (sensory modules). I think of how Jeff Hawkins's Handspring was a modular device designed to mix & match components, allowing also future upgradeability.

[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  So the idea is that we're going to have a global workspace that is multi-level, it's multi-level, it's multi-scale.

[00:12.000 --> 00:16.000]  So the global workspace, you know, that indicates the highest scale.

[00:16.000 --> 00:20.000]  It's like, yeah, whatever gets to the highest scale is what you're paying attention to.

[00:20.000 --> 00:30.000]  That's the idea of global workspace is what gets to the prefrontal cortex.

[00:30.000 --> 00:43.000]  But what I'm talking about is a little bit different in that what gets to the highest level is going to be sort of like the largest scale of what you're paying attention to.

[00:43.000 --> 00:53.000]  And the stuff that you're paying less attention to is going to be stuff at the medial scale or the mesoscale.

[00:53.000 --> 01:10.000]  And the stuff that you're paying at least attention to is going to be at the microscale in the back of your mind in terms of what your mind is focused on.

[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  But you're going to have patterns at all three scales.

[01:13.000 --> 01:23.000]  And what's going to happen is that attention is going to select, medial attention is going to select patterns that the microscale has captured.

[01:23.000 --> 01:25.000]  It's going to select some of them and turn off some of them.

[01:25.000 --> 01:53.000]  And it's going to amplify them to the medial scale, which is when the fractal pattern has an isochronic vector soliton pattern that is a fractal on the microscale

[01:53.000 --> 02:00.000]  of what the gender is receiving, mirrored at the cortical column scale or the narrow oscillator scale.

[02:00.000 --> 02:14.000]  And then brought into the center of your attention when that same pattern has amplified yet again at the macroscale, which is your brain focusing on,

[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  which is where the global workspace is thought to be at.

[02:19.000 --> 02:26.000]  But the thing is, it's like, yeah, we have the global workspace, which is the peak of your attention, which is maybe the apple that you're focused on.

[02:26.000 --> 02:34.000]  But you have all this other stuff that's in the periphery of your awareness and you have stuff that you're unconscious of.

[02:34.000 --> 02:45.000]  And so what I'm saying is that the stuff that's in the periphery of your awareness is stuff that the medial attention centers are picking.

[02:45.000 --> 02:53.000]  But it's not that they're picking, it's that they're being...

[02:53.000 --> 03:03.000]  So what I'm saying is that there's a combination of picking that's happening from bottom up and picking that's happening from the top down.

[03:03.000 --> 03:15.000]  The dendrites can look for certain patterns, they can refuse certain patterns on the lowest scale.

[03:15.000 --> 03:22.000]  The oscillators can seek out certain patterns and reject certain patterns on the medial scale.

[03:22.000 --> 03:35.000]  And then the global workspace can also drive patterns by looking for patterns that it's encountered.

[03:35.000 --> 03:44.000]  Basically, it's seeking patterns that are going to make it fire, that are going to make it light up.

[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  And so it's seeking.

[03:47.000 --> 03:56.000]  So it's also a driving pattern collection, a focus collection, but it's just like...

[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  I think it's like being conditioned to seek rewards, I guess.

[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  So there is like a seeking pattern, but it's sort of like entrained.

[04:08.000 --> 04:20.000]  It's entrained by visits, it's entrained by society, sort of like to have self-driving, self-seeking patterns and all the different levels.

[04:20.000 --> 04:27.000]  So yeah, so there's top down, there's medial, and there's micro selections happening, or choices happening.

[04:27.000 --> 04:33.000]  But these are basically, it's the same process at multiple scales.

[04:33.000 --> 04:40.000]  So with us...

[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  So what's missing from the description of global workspace theory is just saying that,

[04:44.000 --> 04:50.000]  okay, yeah, your mind is representing the pattern of the apple, but it doesn't explain consciousness beyond that.

[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  And what I'm saying is that there is an acceleration.

[04:53.000 --> 05:06.000]  Basically you have to imagine that your mind is not just representing an apple, but it's representing a multi-level screen of concepts

[05:06.000 --> 05:12.000]  that includes everything that you're seeing from the stuff you're focused on to the stuff in your periphery

[05:12.000 --> 05:17.000]  to a model of yourself and your muscular behavior at the same time.

[05:17.000 --> 05:22.000]  All your muscles' signals are running concurrently to your sensory signals.

[05:22.000 --> 05:33.000]  So there's this constant pairing of information streams where your brain is not only considering incoming sensory data,

[05:33.000 --> 05:45.000]  but it's also considering subcortical muscular data, or subcortical signals that are being sent to your muscles

[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  that are coordinating your body movement.

[05:49.000 --> 06:01.000]  So there's this constant simultaneous detection of your body and your inner senses of yourself and your external senses.

[06:01.000 --> 06:08.000]  Inner senses of your muscle movement, and your voice is the muscle movement.

[06:08.000 --> 06:25.000]  But that's simultaneous with your, and also your thoughts are movement, and possibly your inner thoughts are electronic sounds

[06:25.000 --> 06:31.000]  made from magnetic cells on waves, or basically your neurons vibrating.

[06:31.000 --> 06:39.000]  And then other neurons being able to hear the phase changes in those mechanical vibrations

[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  that are correlated 100% with action potential firing.

[06:45.000 --> 06:57.000]  So there's like electric signal firing that's correlated one-to-one with mechanical reverberations.

[06:57.000 --> 07:08.000]  And electric signal firing, you're not passing on the entirety of an electrical spike from one neuron to an external one.

[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  The electrical spike happens to one neuron.

[07:11.000 --> 07:17.000]  And then what happens is a distribution of neurotransmitters.

[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  Here's why this story is different this time.

[07:21.000 --> 07:32.000]  The distribution of neurotransmitters that are hitting the walls of other neurons are transmitting phase information.

[07:32.000 --> 07:46.000]  That's transmitting phase information in terms of voltage patterns and micro-mechanical vibrations.

[07:46.000 --> 07:52.000]  So the neuron has a simultaneous sensitivity, like a drum.

[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  It has a simultaneous sensitivity, like a drum that's both electric and magnetic.

[07:57.000 --> 08:11.000]  It's like a biscensory neuron that is sensing both electric and magnetic phase pulses at multiple scales.

[08:11.000 --> 08:18.000]  And it's able to basically, because it's collecting dendritic signals over time,

[08:18.000 --> 08:26.000]  that result in thresholds at the synaptic level, at the dendritic branch level, at the whole dendrite level,

[08:26.000 --> 08:33.000]  at the soma, and even in X terminal, probably, I guess, I'm not sure.

[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  But because there's like this multi-level sort of like collection,

[08:38.000 --> 08:49.000]  the neuron is basically able to detect, count, or feel as three different views in the same process.

[08:49.000 --> 09:03.000]  To detect, count, feel, or sense a sort of biscensory collection of data.

[09:03.000 --> 09:11.000]  So you have the ionotropic brain, you have the metabolotropic brain,

[09:11.000 --> 09:23.000]  but you have the mechanovibrational brain,

[09:23.000 --> 09:31.000]  or mechanovideo-respiratory brain.

[09:31.000 --> 09:45.000]  And the thing is, what experiences these different things is each is having its own experience.

[09:45.000 --> 09:58.000]  But their experience is, in terms of detecting multimodal, or bimodal, really bimodal,

[09:58.000 --> 10:11.000]  bimodal representations of electric and magnetic phases, and chemical phases.

[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  But yeah, I guess chemical phases.

[10:14.000 --> 10:20.000]  So maybe some of the complex operations that cells do in terms of tracking other cells

[10:20.000 --> 10:28.000]  and dealing in with complex information, they might be happening with simple,

[10:28.000 --> 10:35.000]  with sort of like a chemical tracking, but basically like a similar operation,

[10:35.000 --> 10:44.000]  where if you have cells that are not neurons, but they have chemical receptors,

[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  and they're able to coordinate the activity of other cells,

[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  it could be that they're running similar computations, but not at a conscious level,

[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  but basically like with a level of collective intelligence,

[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  because they're sending and receiving things sort of like,

[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  but the sensory combination is happening like, it's not multimodal,

[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  so it's a low dimensional intelligence, sort of like, we think of non-general AI,

[11:15.000 --> 11:20.000]  or narrow AI as a low dimensional intelligence.

[11:20.000 --> 11:26.000]  It's not, by default, it's not a multimodal situation.

[11:26.000 --> 11:37.000]  And it's not, it's not, you could, you can, you can change,

[11:37.000 --> 11:52.000]  but the key thing that makes the global workspace theory a part of a conscious experience,

[11:52.000 --> 12:05.000]  is that it is rendering a temporally active movie that is running parallel to reality,

[12:05.000 --> 12:11.000]  that is running parallel to other multi-sensory collections of data,

[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  so it's like there's a collection of data that models reality,

[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  a collection of data that models yourself and your movement,

[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  basically yourself is movements.

[12:22.000 --> 12:33.000]  And it's able to correlate connections between different kinds of unstructured data

[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  in real time, and so there's just like, between the organism's reality

[12:39.000 --> 12:46.000]  and the organism's mental picture and the organism's action,

[12:46.000 --> 12:56.000]  there is a sort of like, there's like a painting or a map in each frame

[12:56.000 --> 13:12.000]  that is sort of like, because it's running parallel to reality,

[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  and it's like it's receiving constant updates to reality,

[13:15.000 --> 13:26.000]  it's like it's being detected and produced at the same time,

[13:26.000 --> 13:31.000]  rendered and watched at the same time,

[13:31.000 --> 13:40.000]  and it happens fast enough and consistently enough

[13:40.000 --> 13:51.000]  that it seems like it's this irreducible flow of special sauce

[13:51.000 --> 13:57.000]  that people are trying to figure out and are calling it consciousness,

[13:57.000 --> 14:03.000]  but it's just a rendering that's running simultaneous,

[14:03.000 --> 14:21.000]  a live rendering that's running simultaneous that is being just...

[14:21.000 --> 14:35.000]  it's able to sort of react to reality, because it's not just reality,

[14:35.000 --> 14:43.000]  it's like predictions of how different patterns of movement will cause changes,

[14:43.000 --> 14:52.000]  and so predictions of how the model of this thing called the self or this body of movement

[14:52.000 --> 15:02.000]  causes changes to the map that is generated from the primary sensory areas,

[15:02.000 --> 15:10.000]  and it's also predictions of consequences for different kinds of actions,

[15:10.000 --> 15:19.000]  and it's a process of selecting at multiple levels different patterns to pay attention to

[15:19.000 --> 15:26.000]  in order to attempt to coordinate better results,

[15:26.000 --> 15:36.000]  and so that's the real reason why how global workspace theory becomes an explanation for a real particle.

[15:36.000 --> 15:44.000]  So Michael Grasio thinks that the next step to global workspace theory is going to be the attention schema,

[15:44.000 --> 15:53.000]  or basically how we're paying attention to an apple versus an apple just appearing in our heads,

[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  but I think that's the...

[15:57.000 --> 16:06.000]  if an apple is appearing in your global workspace,

[16:06.000 --> 16:12.000]  then as the most prominent collection of features or concepts,

[16:12.000 --> 16:18.000]  then you are by definition of how I think about the brain already paying attention to it.

[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  So the attention schema actually isn't the next step.

[16:21.000 --> 16:30.000]  The next step in terms of you being able to answer a question about consciousness is a model.

[16:30.000 --> 16:38.000]  You need a model of yourself, of yourself as the source of movements,

[16:38.000 --> 16:46.000]  yourself being at the root like a directional concept from where muscle movements are coming from,

[16:46.000 --> 16:58.000]  and where you're the primary causal factor of most of your experiences in that model of yourself

[16:58.000 --> 17:07.000]  is something that you can use to infer models of other people,

[17:07.000 --> 17:18.000]  basically inferring a model of personhood on another person or on a stuffed animal that looks like a person.

[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  You start to project and say, okay, well, this is my model of myself.

[17:23.000 --> 17:29.000]  Does it match this other person? Does it match a cat? Does it match a dog?

[17:29.000 --> 17:37.000]  Over time, you develop models that are...

[17:37.000 --> 17:48.000]  the model that you have of yourself is going to be made up of components that will be reused

[17:48.000 --> 17:56.000]  and recycled in the building of other models for other people or other kinds of life forms,

[17:56.000 --> 18:07.000]  they might be even recycled for robots and your computer might be mad at your computer,

[18:07.000 --> 18:18.000]  and that's you taking part of the model that you have developed for basically a causal source of movement

[18:18.000 --> 18:26.000]  that is combined with the directional concept of that causal source of movement

[18:26.000 --> 18:32.000]  coming from this direction that's always where you are, right?

[18:32.000 --> 18:40.000]  And then projecting that outwards on things that are in other directions

[18:40.000 --> 18:48.000]  that you navigate, that your causal body is navigating around,

[18:48.000 --> 18:53.000]  things that are less persistent than your own persistence.

[18:53.000 --> 18:59.000]  And your own persistence is sort of cheap in your mind because every time you're awake, there you are

[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  in a manner of speaking where there is that causal body of...

[19:05.000 --> 19:12.000]  this source of actions is there. Your hands are there. I mean, I guess you...

[19:12.000 --> 19:18.000]  You know, I guess. Okay, look, there's different...

[19:18.000 --> 19:23.000]  So what's missing from this combination of global workspace and attention,

[19:23.000 --> 19:29.000]  which is like, for me, really, these two concepts are used together.

[19:29.000 --> 19:36.000]  I don't know how... You can't have... I mean, I guess you could say it's like...

[19:36.000 --> 19:43.000]  With global workspace, you have...

[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  I mean, I guess it's like... I guess you have this idea that...

[19:47.000 --> 19:52.000]  No, it just doesn't make sense. Like, in the brain, for a model to appear,

[19:52.000 --> 19:58.000]  by definition, there's a suppression of what's not appearing.

[19:58.000 --> 20:09.000]  It is a model that exists as a differential pattern.

[20:09.000 --> 20:15.000]  As a grid pattern that's different from other patterns.

[20:15.000 --> 20:20.000]  That's the model. That's the model.

[20:20.000 --> 20:26.000]  And the process of attention is the pattern of neurofiring

[20:26.000 --> 20:31.000]  that's making that particular model appear at that moment in time

[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  and transform over time and transform from the multiple perspectives

[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  of multiple neurons so that there is a connection, a temporal connection,

[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  between spatial patterns.

[20:44.000 --> 20:52.000]  And so that model is sitting there in space

[20:52.000 --> 21:00.000]  and it's co-related with... So it's co-developed with another stream

[21:00.000 --> 21:05.000]  of processing in your brain that runs in parallel to your sensory inputs,

[21:05.000 --> 21:09.000]  which is your motor outputs.

[21:09.000 --> 21:15.000]  And the build-up of the motor outputs is helping to develop the model itself,

[21:15.000 --> 21:19.000]  which is correlated with the sensory representations of yourself.

[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  Like, your visual, like, your muscle movements

[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000]  and your sense of your muscle movements is going to be correlated

[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  with your visual awareness of muscle movements.

[21:33.000 --> 21:38.000]  So you have correlations between different types.

[21:38.000 --> 21:46.000]  And now you have isomorphic vectorized solid form patterns

[21:46.000 --> 21:52.000]  and multiple scales coordinating basically physical analogies

[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  between one pattern at one scale and another pattern at another scale.

[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  So your brain is able to relate the micro to the macro

[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  and basically relate one sort of analogy to another analogy

[22:02.000 --> 22:08.000]  in terms of different modalities or different sort of stories together.

[22:08.000 --> 22:20.000]  And this way of relating complex sets of data to one another

[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  is what's happening at the macro scale

[22:24.000 --> 22:32.000]  when you have large areas of the brain or basically coordinated activities,

[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  coordinated temporal spatial firing activities

[22:35.000 --> 22:40.000]  and multiple cortical columns and multiple oscillators across the brain.

[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  So when you have global brain activity in the global workspace,

[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  that's coordinating a lot of medial brain activity and cortical columns together.

[22:49.000 --> 22:56.000]  And those are coordinating and paying attention to micro neuronal activity

[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  at the neuronal synaptic scale.

[23:00.000 --> 23:06.000]  All of that information is, all of the micro information

[23:06.000 --> 23:13.000]  is being integrated at the global scale, not simultaneously,

[23:13.000 --> 23:18.000]  but like a lens effect where it's magnified,

[23:18.000 --> 23:25.000]  where what is magnified at the sensor has a representation

[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  at the medial scale and the micro scale.

[23:28.000 --> 23:33.000]  But the vast amount of possible representations

[23:33.000 --> 23:37.000]  are stored at the micro scale when they're not needed,

[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  when your attention is not needed.

[23:40.000 --> 23:52.000]  And so attention is basically, I think, the analogous, multi-scale pattern

[23:52.000 --> 23:57.000]  replication, pattern linking between micro scale and macro scale representations

[23:57.000 --> 24:04.000]  or basically the fractal representations on multiple scales

[24:04.000 --> 24:10.000]  across the multilevel graph networks of the brain.

[24:10.000 --> 24:18.000]  And so in chapter 4 of Michael Graziano's book, Rethinking Consciousness,

[24:18.000 --> 24:25.000]  he says that the central idea of attention schema at a high level

[24:25.000 --> 24:30.000]  is not an eyeball moving this looking around,

[24:30.000 --> 24:41.000]  but in the sense of like a frog and its brain

[24:41.000 --> 24:49.000]  that's creating basically a map of the different of the surroundings.

[24:49.000 --> 24:53.000]  But there actually is a mechanism in the center of your brain

[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  that appears to be constantly looking around and seeking.

[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  He's suggesting there isn't one, but there is one,

[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  and that is from new research.

[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  That would be the hippocampus.

[25:06.000 --> 25:13.000]  So hippocampus is able to run,

[25:13.000 --> 25:22.000]  to basically activate areas of the neocortex in sequences.

[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  Basically playing back different areas of neocortex in sequences.

[25:26.000 --> 25:33.000]  That could be an intent like the inner eyeball that, in a sense,

[25:33.000 --> 25:41.000]  because it's constantly rotating through different areas of the cortex,

[25:41.000 --> 25:48.000]  in a sense activating them through search for...

[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  to search through a different possible pattern or disimpossible choices

[25:52.000 --> 25:57.000]  of things that it could play back, different sequences that it could play back.

[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  So there is a sort of searching mechanism that is coordinated,

[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  that is the lower brain hippocampus,

[26:04.000 --> 26:11.000]  that is interfacing with the higher brain, the cerebral cortex.

[26:11.000 --> 26:22.000]  And that is why we have...

[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  Right now.

[26:26.000 --> 26:33.000]  And so, yeah, so that maybe solves the tension scheme in a future future.

[26:33.000 --> 26:43.000]  So that was a reference to covert attention.
