Awesome chat Eyeballs

00:00

Yes, so what if I was? So what if I was to do protein folding with the computer, what could I build? What could I build? Could I build, organs? I boss, could I construct an eyeball, right? If I can fold coatings, could I unfold them? Could I unfold and refold them and restructure and build new organs that have never existed before.

00:28

Could I design new? Kinds of organs new kinds of eyeballs for human beings. What this like, okay, your eyes defective I'm gonna grow you. A new one that has like better vision than anyone's vision has ever been before. Okay, like this vision. This is like going from like 1080p eyesight to 4k eyeballs like what if we upgrade to your eyeballs from 1080p to 4k?

01:00

Right. Do you know what I'm saying? Like that is what I'm talking about here. That's what I think I'm talking about here. Yes, that is absolutely what I'm talking about. Because whether this technology comes together or whatever it comes tomorrow and that's what you are to know. That's what you ought to know and so, and that's hello.

01:35

It's Michael here land. So what I'll do I'll just say on my software, on my software developer for three plus years. I'm actually, I'm not sure how much time but it's more than three years and I make AR and BR applications that run on the web with webXR with letters are API and AFrame and 3GS.

01:59

And I'm getting into react three fiber and I love it. You can make like three basically like three websites, right? And people can put on their VR headset and they can squirt in VR with the two controllers or they. It's gonna like I don't have an AR headset yet but it's gonna work in argument with reality where there won't be a background, but there's like a user interface the people can play with and move around and like when you press a button this is an extra previous you're gonna an object is gonna change its scale rotation and position and like mood in front of you and like and then you can click next and you go to the next object and like you can like point out it and click a button and it fight towards your hand and you can grab it out of the area and it's and then you can throw it and then you can like pick up one object, they hit another object and this is all like, it's not like in a 3D environment.

02:48

It'll work in air to work in VR. It'll work on your phone. And I have, like, I've like some big projects planned. Like, it's if there's a book that I'm working on, that's gonna be. That's gonna be like the base of these webics are like, a series of webs are websites and but but, but I really am interested.

03:10

Also in collaborating with other programmers to build projects, like, I like to know, I like to get to know more programmers who want to collaborate because there's, there's things that I know how to build that. Not a lot of people know how to build but then there's a lot of things that like other people know how to build that.

03:26

I don't yet know how to build. And so like I bet if I get on the right, if I meet the right team, like we could build stuff that's like, even like we could take on Twitter or Netflix or faceobok like we could we could do some really cool stuff.

03:43

But I just it's not as about like where do what what who do I who do? I need to work with so that we can do some really cool. This is anyway, that's my thoughts and I just wanted to share like that's kind of like what I'm up to and I so I have appreciated this whole conversation which is wish I've been a listening for very long time because in the conversation went all over the place but in different sort of different topics.

04:07

It's worth threaded into the conversation. It's great. But yeah no. I mean like I like I like well I was listening I said I said well what if we had another clubhouse chat that was like called getting getting things done like and like what like what is your way of getting things done?

04:24

How do you or your mind, how do you organize, your thinking around, having a business and bringing a product from an idea to come to something that you're actually on? The is it on a shelf or it's on Amazon.com or something or it's a website, or it's a cloud service like and yeah.

04:47

And who do you work with? And how do you get a funded and like the whole process of organizing like all of your content, you know, with gonna like if you're gonna organize a book or if you can organize like what is a major thing that you want to do that?

05:02

You haven't done yet? That's just like next level and like how do you wrap your mind around that and everyone has to kind of, you know, find their own path in a way. But that's what I love this conversation today.

05:16

Y'all have okay? All right. Yeah, take care. Bye with Mary. Yeah. Yeah.

05:42

You really I think it's funny how to write attack and rely. Oh, where they got the paddles here? Oh shit that's miserable. So yeah, he's got, maybe he's got a one of those big

06:17

It's kind of in the news. Yeah, you know, they're taking them in the ambulance so they're not doing superior on the beach. No. I think they were they were No, just here. There is now straight in there when I'm standing under the pool. Guys, we don't remember. Very few words.

06:46

What happened? This will not be a long speech. Thank you. All right, come on, let's go ahead and you just begin. Yeah.

07:31

Okay. Great like early, Like

08:27

All right. Thank you, love. I'll see you Sunday. All right, have to be right?

13:43

I wasn't, I wasn't involved on the software side of things, I was aware of it, I was at the time, doing stuff with JavaScript and dreamweaver and I and related software libraries

14:31

Okay, so I actually by the way. So I was going to plot. I was going to plug my

17:58

You're how long is that flight? Because that sounds like it's too long for that for the quest to be sure.

18:10

Okay.

18:33

I think of my Oculus quest too. Is it too and a half hour device? But I also have an external battery that I just carry with me so I I can go as long as I need.

19:15

There's something, this this I was gonna say, yeah, I'm really excited about the snapchat glasses. That's great. That the that, you know, they're starting to ship to creators but then eventually it's gonna go on sale for customers and so everyone can have these. I hope they're gonna be cheap, the snapchat classes, it's augmented reality.

19:33

It's, it looks awesome. You know, I just hope it's cheap.

19:53

Yeah. Nuance know. These are, these are, these are totally, you know, these ones have augmented realities. You see graphics in front of the, in the world. Yeah. Like okay, let me tell you about this demo. Okay, it's check this out. So you imagine, you're on a, you're on like a scooter, you know there's electronic scooters, you see everywhere.

20:14

You're on a scooter and you're wearing the glasses and you see, you see coins on the ground in front of you. And as you roll down the street, you you roll into the coin and it and you and it disappears and it makes a sound just like, just like your son, like the hedgehog.

20:32

It's like you're you get to be so on like the hedgehog and real life with a scooter and hitting the coins, clicking the coins.

20:47

Is it available to die? I didn't know that. Yeah yeah but this is awesome. I didn't know. It was available to buy.

21:00

Shit, I want to buy one.

21:55

Okay, but get but but let me tell you something else. Okay, so now Oculus has opened the API for doing creating augmented reality applications with Oculus Quest. Did you know it could do augmented reality? It can. And now, now they're now developers are starting to create augment reality applications.

22:19

In fact if you are developer you can you can start doing creating your AR application in unity right now in the your Oculus Quest.

22:39

Yeah, that's what they're doing.

22:56

So at the moment it's it's only working with unity but they're trying to make sure that anyone who develops a program can you know it's just it's just that they haven't got to the other ones yet but it's going to be all all developers with all tools, all developer tools, you know, eventually.

24:44

But but something that I have always wanted since, like, I was since I was a kid like it, like, a two-foot tall, kid is the ability to turn reality into a video game, and that's what we're getting. It's so awesome. Yeah.

25:37

Yeah, the graphics are going to be a graphics for mixed reality going to be so good. That, you know, at some point the the video games will look more real than reality.

26:04

All right.

26:12

Like hours. Yeah, like I'm just like imagine like what if we could create computer graphics that were actually higher resolution than reality? Like how awesome would that be?

26:57

Have you seen unreal engines midnight? Because nanite is exciting new technology because they're just really efficiently, delivering graphics so that you can the the artist no longer has to worry about polygon counts. Think you can put you can make you can it basically just delivers exactly 
what you need to see.

27:20

So you could have a scene that has 50 billion polygons in it, but but the computers are only going to send the 20 million polygons that are facing your eye at that particular moment. And and that is like, huge CPU savings. So we can have these, like, you know, extremely detailed universes.

27:43

That are just that the if we take artists it, it takes artists like just an incomprehensible amount of time to design that like, without like amazing tools, it sort of help them to procedurally, generate their content. But based on like photogrammetry scans of the real world. Where the real detail is because it's just like a tremendous amount of detail now that we can deliver to a person's eyeballs with this new technology.

28:24

By like, I'm am I my like I'm also in the neuroscience space and in the deep learning space but like in terms of like I'm also in the space of like designing the architecture for new kinds of machines like self-aware machines and like intelligent glue and like all sorts of like yeah, all sorts of weird stuff.

29:04

Yeah. I mean the animated catch-up is like, I mean, I literally read books and papers on neuroscience. And and I think it's like at least 15 years of biology to catch up to like everything that I've read. So just like like definitely. You definitely won't won't learn everything from me.

29:22

But but I'm right working on a book and it's gonna be awesome. It's gonna have neuroscience and deep learning, and then it's gonna be in webs, or people can experience the book, and I hope it's a. I hope it's great but I gotta get, I've actually have to go, I have to go and work on this book and 
it was great talking to you all and

29:48

Yeah, it's it's, it's about three. It's about three months from now. I'll have an officially published a date, but I will.

30:01

Great. Okay. Bye everybody. Cheers.
