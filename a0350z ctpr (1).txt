"The personal activity is absolutely useless."
this is the next delusion that will fall away from you
Personal activity is essential, even though our choices are not driven by ourselves they are important, our choices are driven by criteria, information criteria patterns, as coincidental firing patterns in brain cell circuits recognizing specific information patterns and they plan future responses to what may happen.
So the reason it seems like a choice is happening before conscious awareness is because you had a planned reaction in your cells that was actually your choice driven by reasons.
