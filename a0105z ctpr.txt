(LTP, oscillat, field)
The galactic filaments are related to LTP, because the synchronous oscillations between galaxies are heating the space between the galaxies, shaping the curvature of spacetime, attracting particles, creating atoms, like gas, atoms are created out of empty space, defining the higgs field, and creating the path integral formulation.
