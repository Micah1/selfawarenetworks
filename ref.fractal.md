  37: What is the entity that is you, is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in a cycling phase oscillation or a branching fractal feedback loop entified via brainwave synchronization of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes across the 3D grid neural-glial network. You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of ne

    5: Originally from 2014. This was my long lost equation for the neuron & brain as a fractal of a neuron, found again in 2022. I just updated it with some new knowledge.

  101: The idea I had (in 2014) was that the neuron is transmitting a program that is a temporal/spatial metaphor of it's shape, into a fractal brain, that is doing the same thing, so it's like a temporal spatial metaphor on both the individual neuron level, and the neural network level.

    7: All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, via Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation, this note explores some of the original ideas in Q.G.T.C.D.

   60: I argue that spacetime, including mass & energy, is a fractal of oscillators. It does not seem to be a stretch to consider that spacetime is 3D time interval between oscillations, with the magnitude of the 3D space at each interval of time being flattened time.
   61  
   62: In a fractal cosmos it would make intuitive or visual sense for the relationship of particles to oscillate between a location existence in vortices ie atoms & galaxies, and a frequency interval that is 'an expand spacetime void' relative to the combined density of the oscillator.

  8: different cortical columns oscillate or take turns either in a listening stage or in a firing stage, you will have many neurons receieving the same firing instructions at the same times to reproduce high level patterns that are recognized and stored as low level patterns, each low level pattern is a fractal of a higher fired pattern, but since many neurons have to have coordinated firing to evoke that pattern they all share the same firing instructions, ie the same pattern that all of a set of neurons has learned is stored in each neuron, so each one individual detects that pattern and fires accordingly, and new patterns are learned when new AP firing patterns are added at a high level from an unexpected real world event and that modifies the memory of the original micropattern that each neuron in that sequence is going to remember as a variation on its pattern memory.

  7: What is the entity that is you? I argue that entity of you is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in a 3D grid of cells, a rendering emerging from oscillating phase changes, with temporal/spatial configurations across the 3D brain. You are a pattern or a rendering emerging from a branching (or fractal) feedback loop (referring to how information flows in the brain) resulting from the brainwave synchronization of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes across this 3D neural-glial network grid resulting in the entification of you, the entity. You are entified via the principles of neural oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz, and the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single or unified sensor/transmitter/consideration/action system, a sensor system that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, in the book On Intelligence).

  63: This next link is an example of deep learning applied to medical imaging, what is interesting is the idea that a synapse which is gap junction between transmitters & receptors can be thought of as a fractal of a neuron, with inhibitory & excitatory neurons having inhibitory & excitatory synapses on them, and functionally speaking a sodium receptor inside a synapse is like an excitatory receptor, and a potassium receptor is like an inhibitory receptor. So we have two fractals levels here. That's before you dive into what is happening inside the receptor. Biology, and reality is so weird. So weird it's actually a functional fractal, not always a geometric fractal, but functionally a fractal, with the same operations happening at different scales. Excitation & inhibition, it's this like positive & negative charges in a functional sense?

  6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

  22  The brain is going to learn scale invariant patterns, like vectors, that are distance & location invariant, temporally invariant, and phase invariant.

  23  
  24: so the delta wave is an oscillatory pattern that observes changes as phase changes in its phase field, the phase changes could be modeled as topological patterns encoded in phase changes over time, sensed, detected, and enlarged by subsequent arrays of oscillating groups of neurons, which is why we have the fractal brain activity patterns being replicated on different scales, so the brain is modelling patterns in every modality for every perspective at each interval of time with updates being the fastest closest to the sensory inputs. In part because the energy of incoming signal transmission is being dissipated with distance as it enters the brain to the highest layer which has the greatest lateral connectivities for learning large scale patterns. but the large scale synchronization at that depth and scale is going to be best accomplished with the slowest oscillations, the delta frequencies. 23

Yet this brain is your window into grasping what you are. Your brain estimate's that your brain at the most captures .0000000000000001 of what is actually real. everything you know about your golden fiery self is a flawed prediction in this mind, you know you are truth, perfect, divine, objectively real, and at the same time, you know your brain needs to have a very partial & narrow view of the whole of what you are. the brain has a job coordinating a specific angle on your vision, in this case, the brain that does not know so much serves as a highly coordinated sharply defined brush stroke, in the fractal artwork of your divine mathematical calculation. So you are not your brain, and yet all that you know about your real self is from a model in your brain. A model that is wholly informed by you, always being an incomplete map of you, never the whole reality of how amazing you are.

This would allow each neuron to correlate the 3 types of waves with the dendrite serving as a detector, or a pooler that creates the 4 dimensional (3 dimensions of space and 1 of time) soliton wave form that neurons on the receiving end will use to compile their own picture or potentially a 4 dimensional pattern representation of what signals were transmitted that maps, correlates,  crafts, produces and transmits more such combinations of soliton wave transmissions.

   66: Micah Blumberg Well not exactly, the idea is that the universe only has to render what is being observed, (it doesn't have to store what isn't being observed) and what is being observed is generated from mathematical formulas that result in all these fractals we seem to see everywhere. The universe doesn't have to store any data beyond the fundamental mathematical formulas that give rise to the position of every calcium ion in your brain. The reasoning is that these mathematical formula's can regenerate whatever your learning would have been, in the moment they are needed, regardless of whether you vanished from existence for some period of time prior to whatever is happening right now.

  8: Micah, You seem to be asking about the famous binding problem: how things bind and become invariants, where semantics and scaling come from, why fractals and power laws are so abundant in nature. Here is what I can say. Take a causal set (S, w). It has a corresponding permutation groupoid, which induces a group-theoretical block system on S. In addition, and here comes the interesting part, partial order w induces a partial order on the blocks, and the block system itself becomes a (smaller) causal set. This property of recurrence should explain hierarchies, fractals, power laws, scaling, semantics, emergence, AGI.

  16  I think the question really depends on the definition of "communication." Cells in a sponge or slime mold communicate with one another in an organized fashion. By the same token, you could argue (and some have) that ant colonies and beehives are actually meta-organisms whose individual members correspond to the neurons in a brain. But no one (as far as I know) is going around saying these organisms and meta-organisms have anything like a true CNS. 
  17: I think the main distinguishing factor between those informational architectures and, say, a vertebrate brain is that their communication patterns are emergent and bottom-up; there's no corresponding network of inhibitory connections that interfaces with the bottom-up network and imposes order on it in any centralized way. Another major point is that these networks lack the kind of fractal symmetry that's very obvious in functional nodal architectures even in the nervous systems of simple organisms like C. elegans.
  18  I'm not ruling out the possibility that these fungal networks could have evolved built-in checks for factors like stimulus salience, etc. - but I'd say calling it "consciousness" is reaaallly stretching it. Especially since we still don't have a precise scientific definition for "consciousness."

    9: Curiously what is happening inside biology appears to be a functional fractal of the operations that operate outside humanity in society. Cells, as functional fractals of a person, can change their shape and grow appendages like arms and legs that allow them to move through the human body.
   10  The flexible rapidly changing cytoskeleton filaments can produce arms and legs that allow white blood cells to swim, or crawl forward like amoebas, rolling tethering or firm attachment. Essentially white blood cells can walk forward stepwise with two feet that alternately adhere and release at different places.
   11: A category of white blood cells called neutrophils can clump together and swarm near the epicenter of the problem, they send several scouts, which relay signals to those behind. So the neutrophils are like a fractal of a military column, with lots of attack options. They form a dense extracellular matrix.

   23: Macro attention is going to select patterns that you're that the microscale has captured. It's going to select some of them and turn off some of them and it's going to amplify them to the medial scale which is when the factor pattern has a. And and I and I so I so I start chronic that vector soliton pattern, that is a fractal on the microscale, what the generous, receiving mirrored at the cortical column scale, or there are oscillator scale and then and then brought it into the center of your attention when that same pattern is amplified.

  152: When you are not when your attention is not needed. And so attention is basically. I think of the analogous multi-scale pattern. Replication pattern linking between microscale and macroscale, representations, or basically the fractal, the factory representations on multiple scales across the acrostic wrath, the multi-level graph networks of the brain. And so in chapter 4 of Michael Graziano's book rethinking consciousness, he says that there's, he says that the central idea of consciousness is of this right of attention.

  1583:    750    119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.
  1584     751:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

  2023:     33     4: All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, define the electromagnetic phase field and define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime thanks to Einstein. Space around atoms expands because of increasing travel times between one space oscillation somewhere and another spacetime oscillation that's no where, and one more that's 
  2024      34:   10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower ~~amplitude~~ magnitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)

Replication pattern linking between microscale and macroscale, representations, or basically the fractal, the factory representations on multiple scales across the acrostic wrath, the multi-level graph networks of the brain. And so in chapter 4 of Michael Graziano's book rethinking consciousness, he says that there's, he says that the central idea of consciousness is of this right of attention.

  4416     563:    4: The most important thing that I took away from the book sync is that it doesn't matter to consciousness whether our brains are dead or alive, because is its the physics of oscillators in a certain information configuration that forms memory patterns as decoherence patterns and produces sensor arrays to be conscious awareness. This consciousness configuration of the brains oscillators comes with a high fidelity sparse distributed time, space, tonic, phasic, and inhibitory memory system, that produces a distributed 3D phase field for learning coincidence patterns, and communicating & computing these patterns.
  4417:    564     6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

  4420     580:   14: I decided to explain my favorite new ideas in a book since I have so many new ideas but at the same time I wanted to describe a new kind of machine that is conscious but in order to explain that I had to explain the neurophysics of consciousness, which involves a discussion of astrophysics, quantum physics, oscillations, sync, and along with this machine is its ability to interface with the human brain so I have to describe the part of the machine that is the brain computer interface, its goals, its exact methods, its scope.
  4421:    581    24: so the delta wave is an oscillatory pattern that observes changes as phase changes in its phase field, the phase changes could be modeled as topological patterns encoded in phase changes over time, sensed, detected, and enlarged by subsequent arrays of oscillating groups of neurons, which is why we have the fractal brain activity patterns being replicated on different scales, so the brain is modelling patterns in every modality for every perspective at each interval of time with updates being the fastest closest to the sensory inputs. In part because the energy of incoming signal transmission is being dissipated with distance as it enters the brain to the highest layer which has the greatest lateral connectivities for learning large scale patterns. but the large scale synchronization at that depth and scale is going to be best accomplished with the slowest oscillations, the delta frequencies. 23

  4550    2468:     36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  4552    2470:    120:   14: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

  4844    1242:   2470:    120:   14: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends.

It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.
   751    122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

    32:    3: oscillating functional fractal isomorphism
    33:    4: All human beings are fractal oscillations, but in a real sense each one of us is creating spacetime and ourselves at the sametime, because oscillators define spacetime, all oscillators create the space around them by forcing particles into collision patterns that produce gravity, define the electromagnetic phase field and define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime thanks to Einstein. Space around atoms expands because of increasing travel times between one space oscillation somewhere and another spacetime oscillation that's no where, and one more that's 
    34    10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower ~~amplitude~~ magnitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)

    39    22: when oscillators run out of energy, velocity should resume and location vanish
    40:   24: sonce space is full of a fractal of oscillators, it would not seem to be a stretch therefore for spacetime to be a 4D interval between oscillations
    41:   26: in a fractal cosmos it would make sense for the relationship of particles to oscillate between a location existence in vortices ie atoms and galaxies, and an frequency interval that is expanding space relative to the oscillator
    42    30: The new interval of spacetime is caused by oscillators warping phase space fields and creating particle collision lanes. Space would be moving fastest at the particle scale, and at human scale time is really slow relative to quantum physics,

   162    27: the number of possible states range from a single oscillation, between existence and non-existence, between 0 and 1

   214    154: because the oscillating force of each galaxy on the fabric of spacetime means that they warp space time in between them, the signals between the two points in space happen faster because in each respective direction signals are happening faster so the whole space between them is happening faster

I argue that entity of you is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in a 3D grid of cells, a rendering emerging from oscillating phase changes, with temporal/spatial configurations across the 3D brain. You are a pattern or a rendering emerging from a branching (or fractal) feedback loop (referring to how information flows in the brain) resulting from the brainwave synchronization of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes across this 3D neural-glial network grid resulting in the entification of you, the entity. You are entified via the principles of neural oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz, and the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single or unified sensor/transmitter/consideration/action system, a sensor system that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, in the book On Intelligence).

   527:    6: You are a fractal oscillating node on an oscillating branch of the cosmos which is an fractal oscillating that is actually a single oscillation from the perspective outside time and space.
   528     8: The perspective outside time and space is seeing the cosmos as the ever present now. One long undivided moment in which the perception of time by the simultaneous increases in extropy and entropy because the two forces are bound in that they always increase together as the oscillators evolve in complexity they dissipate entropy to the surrounding environment, and the perpendicular oscillations of positive and negative electrons (an oscillatory splay state describes the difference between positive and negative charge, fermions are space in a state of decoherence, and bosons are in a state of electrical coherence with W and Z bosons being examples of high phase states that decay quickly by resonator dissipation into the larger group of oscillation, W and Z have too much energy relative to other bosons, which they cannot maintain, its like a top that is spinning too fast, to much angular momentum.

   563     4: The most important thing that I took away from the book sync is that it doesn't matter to consciousness whether our brains are dead or alive, because is its the physics of oscillators in a certain information configuration that forms memory patterns as decoherence patterns and produces sensor arrays to be conscious awareness. This consciousness configuration of the brains oscillators comes with a high fidelity sparse distributed time, space, tonic, phasic, and inhibitory memory system, that produces a distributed 3D phase field for learning coincidence patterns, and communicating & computing these patterns.
   564:    6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.
   565:    8: I would divide the entire brain into a series of fractal sensor arrays, with sensor arrays joining up with other sensory arrays to magnify their receptive fields by each adjacent oscillator they are tonically firing with.
   566    15: Once oscillators fire together they merge together, they never stop firing together on their own, imagine that it takes some third oscillator to send them a knock that will cause them to oscillate differently again, and oscillators merge in random clubs

   580    14: I decided to explain my favorite new ideas in a book since I have so many new ideas but at the same time I wanted to describe a new kind of machine that is conscious but in order to explain that I had to explain the neurophysics of consciousness, which involves a discussion of astrophysics, quantum physics, oscillations, sync, and along with this machine is its ability to interface with the human brain so I have to describe the part of the machine that is the brain computer interface, its goals, its exact methods, its scope.
   581:   24: so the delta wave is an oscillatory pattern that observes changes as phase changes in its phase field, the phase changes could be modeled as topological patterns encoded in phase changes over time, sensed, detected, and enlarged by subsequent arrays of oscillating groups of neurons, which is why we have the fractal brain activity patterns being replicated on different scales, so the brain is modelling patterns in every modality for every perspective at each interval of time with updates being the fastest closest to the sensory inputs. In part because the energy of incoming signal transmission is being dissipated with distance as it enters the brain to the highest layer which has the greatest lateral connectivities for learning large scale patterns. but the large scale synchronization at that depth and scale is going to be best accomplished with the slowest oscillations, the delta frequencies. 23
   582    64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

   683    3: (oscillat)
   684:   5: I like to imagine that once upon a time there was an ancient doctor who deduced that the universe is a fractal oscillator from stars to atoms, and he used this intuition to develop the ability to fix and repair the human body as if it was just a clock, or a mechanical robot, but humanity wasn't ready to understand this technology, so this healer passed a dramatized message down through time by turning medicine into a mystical novelty that would tickle the human mind for centuries until some future medical professional deduced the real non-mystical origin of the original message. 
   685    9: The stories that unite us are not just stories, they are stories that contain attractors that link to transcendent or timeless oscillators that help to shape cultures across time, but interestingly if the brainwaves in the human mind represent a story, that contains attractors that drive oscillations and drive actions, and these stories working on multiple time scales as explored by Dr. Karl Friston (who does not have a PhD) then perhaps the stories of our mythologies represent attractors that drive thinking patterns on time scales that exceed human life times.

   726:    6: the multi-layered deconvergence will add distinctions to each iteration of a pattern, this process I imagine would be useful for both error correction, with the most consistent patterns learned gaining dominance through a sort of oscillatory convergence of firing over time, with many subsequent stages of firing across layers, across columns, all over the brain, repeating fractally at different scales.
   727    10: I can see how oscillatory wave convergence into power bands and large dipoles might improve the brains internal models, in a similar way to how tomography works by combining multiple perspectives and the computer basically learning a 3D model from intersections between 2D perspectives. This is defined in the Fourier Slice Theorem. A row of neurons in another layer would also act as a force of pattern convergence, and pattern magnificationthrough LTD or the inhibition of lots of post synaptic cells, that begin to oscillate together because they each reached their threshold when that one neuron fired.

   834    23: I am imagining that space time is redefined by observers, or that a brain is a dissipative system, a bundle of vortices, or oscillators, or cyclones in spacetime itself, these vortices are power bands, attractors, with a space re-defining nature because of the oscillatory interplay between space and human oscillators. The interaction points cause cascading wripples in space, affecting the fabric of space time, making gravity possible as an attractor state between oscillatorys which are warming spacetime to attract electric phases and bind them together, slowing them down into increasingly dense mass states.
   835:   25: I like to think of space as something that was created everywhere at once, and at every time at once, as if all of time is forever happening inside an ever present now moment. We are experiencing the frequences of time folding around itself in massive oscillators, and micro oscillators. We are oscillators inside oscillators with oscillators inside us with a fractal ordinance.

   976    11: but its like an oscillation of space time creating a frequency
   977:   13: its frequency is an attractor to other particles, so they start clumbing together over time, eventual stars planets and even what we call life which is actually just a continuation of the fractal of the cosmos on increasingly complex scales because they follow the laws of entropy by exporting increating chaos over all to a surrounding environment and getting enough energy to maintain its oscillation equilibrium

  1641    182: 0.02 hz to 600 Hertz is your phase field. That's what your neurons are detecting & changing (sensing, considering, modifying, and transmitting). That is the light inside the mind's eye, the light that is appearing in your brain's neural oscillators as the neurons broadcasts, the patterns that are being recognized to your neural oscillators. Your mind is rendered frequencies (brainwaves) encoded in oscillating groups of cell assemblies (like cortical columns, neural circuits, edge communities, neural sensory arrays) and then your neural-oscillators see the world, predict the future, and react to the predicted future. Your brain predicts the future of its own actions, but the brain also predicts the future of other people's actions, and you use this process to predict & render to yourself the future, the environmental consequences of your actions in the environment.
  1642:   186: And so you find yourself in a world of people that are That you are interacting at human level but you're but at the same time you're knowing that your whole body is a fractal oscillation, that is a branch node in a fractal universe.

  1724    104: The particular oscillation, is that previously belonged to that plant? When it didn't when it wasn't, when it didn't have Christmas tree ornaments and a combines that with the plant now that it has persistence. So the plants representations. So now, so now we can take out the plant. It has Christmas tree ordinance on it.
  1725:   110: But it takes a combination of the new data and old data to create the rendering that your mind is going to perceive and it's the oscillation of neurons. That's that is creating a basically. Consciousness is like a higher level representation of a lower level representation. It's like a scaled up fractalization of a smaller learned pattern and so as you move your eyes around the space looking at everything, benches tables, chairs walls window sidewalks.
  1726    116: So, each type of interval, right? And and these intervals. Have they have some integral characteristics that can diet the in the memory of those in the association of, it's not just a memory of the characteristics that would be stored in the synapse, but it's the association of different oscillations.

  1757    132: You've just you've learned through at some point when you had contact with this person, you both learned the same oscillatory pattern in your clocks, you had some part of your brain, had a, you know, saved a clock memory that that Save the memory. In this temporal clock, that associated with this other person's pattern.
  1758:   134: And and it could be that the the that oscillations also that oscillation also gets magnified globally. You know it's if someone that you're in sync with has an injury or something, it's possible that that there's a fractal sort of like representation where that's like where where a novel event becomes like it's own and I will event in society becomes its own a tractor, it becomes its own like neuron bursting and so it's spread it.
  1759    138: So that burst activity then becomes encoded by the people who are now. They're basically expecting news from you, right? There's, there's a clocks have been aligned and so you're starting the group oscillation. Right, and yes. So it remains to be seen in terms of, you know. So it's possible that if if let's say that the oscillation changes the global oscillation that that was a basically that triggered like you're connect your they triggered oscillator and also Tory memory as you have it, the other person that was retrieved with a certain cadence and so that memory like occurs to a certain time, but if the global oscillation has changed relative to that one oscillation, then the other oscillation might notice it.

  1836    63: And so we have to so we have to god. Dammit. No. Imagine that the branch that the oscillations of reality from small scale atoms to large scale of galaxies that they can be thought of as having a practical form, like a tree where the branches, because of the nature of oscillators to attract one another.
  1837:   69: So like if you imagine if you imagine you know, if you go from this order of you have a big oscillator, followed by a smaller oscillator followed by a smaller oscillator and then you look at human beings. This is also can also fractals oscillating, you know, fractals because it goes down human beings.
  1838    71: And then and then, you know, our narrow circuits neurons. And then the, the the chart and charged the ions charge atoms. The ions, the, the, the electrons. You know what, we can. The describing the electron is as an attractor in an oscillator sort of or just one point of an at one point in an oscillating and in the in the fabric of space-time oscillating, that's I like to imagine it.
  1839    73: Electrons are the literal fabric of space-time also oscillating between having a physician and having a velocity or something like that. It's in some way. The the idea is that space time is, is can't. It is. It's the fundamental isolation is is undecidability or yeah, like, undecided ability, or it just can't decide what state it wants to be it, like, do I exist or do I not exist?
  1840:   75: It's sort of thing like because the universe can't decide it it oscillates between existing and not existing, in a sense and that oscillation creates an oscillation cascade which creates space time because the each of the, because from the first oscillate, the for the first oscillation to the multiplication of oscillations, the fractalization of space time is growing and so space time, appears to expand, but it's expanding relative to the oscillators, but since human beings are oscillators hemolytes trees.
  1841    79: Is this sort of like oscillation we're all the holes bottom surface area of the tree on the certain axis is growing simultaneously. So the plant is like growing up out of the ground and but it has a diameter. So we ended and did diameter is basically a cylinder that starts branching off into different branches later on.
  1842    83: So, the tree there's, there's, you know, a circle is, like, I'm just like, imagining like an oscillator as like a circle and a sense, and many oscillators being aligned is like a tree branch, right? And so we go from the, you know, well basically big stars to people and the progression of the evolution of the universe.
  1843:   85: But what we're seeing is that we're that we're all part of the branches of a great, oscillatory tree and at and at the same time that. So basically that wouldn't mean what that means. So is that as a human being you are like the branch of a tree your branch of the tree of the the oscillating fractal universe, right?
  1844  

  1857     90: So that there is a growing awareness that if you have a brain that is where synchronization is being constantly disrupted, you have a brain because you have like you have it's it's only by encoding the synchronized pattern with decoherence or desynchronization or disruptions that are meaningful in the context of information theory, rare patterns among the common tonic oscillation. Does that happen? Is that carrier of synchronization, which can be thought of as the container of a soliton.
  1858:   102: Basically, the entire human being is a fractal of oscillation, and these oscillations are like the gears of a clock, or computational processors like a TPU, CPU, or GPU. 
  1859    113: Looks like a vortex. A hurricane. Looks like a vortex and the atom looks like a vortex. I didn't realize that vortices include, you know, human cells. Human cells are vortexes inside. Vortices with vortices are beside those vortices. It's like a practical vortex, but the oscillation of the vortex is an oscillation and an oscillation is the vortex.

You know, oftentimes people get people become in the course of a commerce conversation where there's back and forth. Conversation, you're becoming an oscillator with that other person. And if if things are, if the result is a positive outcome, both persons probably contributed to that positive outcome.
  1901:   19: Resonating with, with patterns, transmitting patterns, receiving patterns, and storing patterns to replay patterns. There's a, you know, the fractal of a neuron is the fractal of a neurosurgeon is the fractal of a cortical column is the fact of a neuro oscillator. The fact is a factor of your whole brain.
  1902    29: And in terms of being that tipping point, thing that the shifts the entire assembly from one state to another but the tipping point. So, the shipping point idea, is sort of like accomplished because tonic oscillations give you a bridge, which means you do not necessarily wish me as you do not need.

  1968      5: If a memory stored in synaptic connections becomes conscious, it is being magnified with a kind of oscillatory telescope to the whole brain, the pattern embodied by that neuron's morphology ripples from micro to macro.
  1969:    23: Macro attention is going to select patterns that you're that the microscale has captured. It's going to select some of them and turn off some of them and it's going to amplify them to the medial scale which is when the factor pattern has a. And and I and I so I so I start chronic that vector soliton pattern, that is a fractal on the microscale, what the generous, receiving mirrored at the cortical column scale, or there are oscillator scale and then and then brought it into the center of your attention when that same pattern is amplified.
  1970     32: Okay, so what I'm saying is that, there's a combination of picking that's happening from bottom up and picking this happening from the top down. As in the, the danger rates can look for certain patterns and they can refuse certain patterns on the lowest scale, the oscillators can seek out certain patterns and reject certain patterns on the medial scale and then the global workspace can also drive patterns by looking for patterns that it's encountered.

  2468      36:   42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

  2470     120:   14: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

  2563:    75:   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.
  2564:    76:   8: I would divide the entire brain into a series of fractal sensor arrays, with sensor arrays joining up with other sensory arrays to magnify their receptive fields by each adjacent oscillator they are tonically firing with.
  2565:    82:   24: so the delta wave is an oscillatory pattern that observes changes as phase changes in its phase field, the phase changes could be modeled as topological patterns encoded in phase changes over time, sensed, detected, and enlarged by subsequent arrays of oscillating groups of neurons, which is why we have the fractal brain activity patterns being replicated on different scales, so the brain is modelling patterns in every modality for every perspective at each interval of time with updates being the fastest closest to the sensory inputs. In part because the energy of incoming signal transmission is being dissipated with distance as it enters the brain to the highest layer which has the greatest lateral connectivities for learning large scale patterns. but the large scale synchronization at that depth and scale is going to be best accomplished with the slowest oscillations, the delta frequencies. 23

All of space down to human cells consists of a fractal tree of functional ismorphic oscillations or dissipative systems, the universe has been described as a system of harmonic waves at the quantum scale, and we can sense vibrations, powerful resonations in part because our whole bodies are made of this sensitive material, but our bodies and minds 
  2574    246: ⟪ 337 characters skipped ⟫thinking about a specific memory detail, like the texture of a cup, the synaptic connections that my represent the properties cup in our cortical columns are expressed, magnified through inhibition & oscillation, to the meso scale, and eventually they effect the pattern of large scale dipoles, of brainwave activity, which means they are seen by the whole brain at the macroscale, thats when our parietal temporal junction is lit up and we are focused on something, that's a macroscale focus on pattern that is stored in synaptic connections in a cortical column.
  2575:   269:   186: And so you find yourself in a world of people that are That you are interacting at human level but you're but at the same time you're knowing that your whole body is a fractal oscillation, that is a branch node in a fractal universe.
  2576:   277:   110: But it takes a combination of the new data and old data to create the rendering that your mind is going to perceive and it's the oscillation of neurons. That's that is creating a basically. Consciousness is like a higher level representation of a lower level representation. It's like a scaled up fractalization of a smaller learned pattern and so as you move your eyes around the space looking at everything, benches tables, chairs walls window sidewalks.
  2577:   282:   134: And and it could be that the the that oscillations also that oscillation also gets magnified globally. You know it's if someone that you're in sync with has an injury or something, it's possible that that there's a fractal sort of like representation where that's like where where a novel event becomes like it's own and I will event in society becomes its own a tractor, it becomes its own like neuron bursting and so it's spread it.
  2578:   293:   69: So like if you imagine if you imagine you know, if you go from this order of you have a big oscillator, followed by a smaller oscillator followed by a smaller oscillator and then you look at human beings. This is also can also fractals oscillating, you know, fractals because it goes down human beings.
  2579:   294:   75: It's sort of thing like because the universe can't decide it it oscillates between existing and not existing, in a sense and that oscillation creates an oscillation cascade which creates space time because the each of the, because from the first oscillate, the for the first oscillation to the multiplication of oscillations, the fractalization of space time is growing and so space time, appears to expand, but it's expanding relative to the oscillators, but since human beings are oscillators hemolytes trees.
  2580:   295:   85: But what we're seeing is that we're that we're all part of the branches of a great, oscillatory tree and at and at the same time that. So basically that wouldn't mean what that means. So is that as a human being you are like the branch of a tree your branch of the tree of the the oscillating fractal universe, right?
  2581:   306:   102: Basically, the entire human being is a fractal of oscillation, and these oscillations are like the gears of a clock, or computational processors like a TPU, CPU, or GPU.

Now, it tracks tracks oscillations between actions and sensory inputs.
  2583:   321:   19: Resonating with, with patterns, transmitting patterns, receiving patterns, and storing patterns to replay patterns. There's a, you know, the fractal of a neuron is the fractal of a neurosurgeon is the fractal of a cortical column is the fact of a neuro oscillator. The fact is a factor of your whole brain.
  2584:   337:    23: Macro attention is going to select patterns that you're that the microscale has captured. It's going to select some of them and turn off some of them and it's going to amplify them to the medial scale which is when the factor pattern has a. And and I and I so I so I start chronic that vector soliton pattern, that is a fractal on the microscale, what the generous, receiving mirrored at the cortical column scale, or there are oscillator scale and then and then brought it into the center of your attention when that same pattern is amplified.
  2585:   357:   7: So, you have to think about fractal of what's happening in the micro level. So when we're talking about macro dipole, oscillation is being the, you see.

I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.
