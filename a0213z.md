(thalamus, perception, dendrite, synap, cerebellum, cortex) In order for the Action and Perception Cycle to work the patterns between the corresponding areas (like what you see, hear, and touch) have to be connected and simultaneous (they have to have a temporal & spatial connection in the brain I meant). 
synapses form new connections during learning between activated brain cells, cells that spike within moments of each other grow synaptic connections between one another

Note oscillations also cluster naturally.

Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.

A phase shift or a firing frequency change.
The synaptic events can be thought of as oscillators sending a knock, a knock that nudges the oscillations of other oscillators plus or minus in their own phase pattern.

Study shows new brain connections form rapidly during motor learning
"As mice learned a new task, repeated imaging of the same neurons over one-day intervals showed remodeling of synapses, with new branches (dendritic spines) forming and others eliminated during training. Image credit: Xu et al." https://news.ucsc.edu/2009/11/3413.html

"These results indicate that distal
tuft depolarization is required for the behaviourally evoked dendritic activity and that this depolarization is provided by vM1 input to L1. Thus, it seems that distal dendritic plateau potentials are responsible for producing a nonlinear dendritic integration of coordinated sen- sory and motor information in layer 5 pyramidal neurons during active sensing"

In this situation the tip of the dendrite, called the distal tuft, it had its own depolarization event, this was in the first layer of the mouses motor cortex which is called vM1, and then that connects to L1

"These interactions between sensory and motor systems are crucial for haptic perception (Diamond et al., 2008, Gibson, 1962, Wolpert et al., 1995). Sensorimotor integration in whisker-based somatosensation is mediated by brain structures that form a series of nested loops, at the levels of the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral cortex (Diamond et al., 2008, Kleinfeld et al., 1999). Little is known about the cellular architecture of these different loops."
