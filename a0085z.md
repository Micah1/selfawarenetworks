I have new configuration ideas for plausible conscious mechanisms

It's was the year 2012
I had just moved to San Francisco
I had a business idea because I had tried an experience that I called NEO MIND CYCLE

It combined natural supplentments, like blue lotus flower for relaxation, and nootropics, with brain stimulating technologies and neurofeedback. It used Neuroprogrammer and Mind Workstation software (created by a company called Transparent Corp) and I was able to customize light & audio brainwave entrainment tracks, and drive changes to the signal patterns with EEG signals. It felt like I was connecting my brain into the computer, that my consciousness was being extended outside my head into the computer itself. I felt like I could decode and understand how my thoughts and feelings were actually brainwaves that I could detect now thanks to the light of this neurofeedback, my thoughts and feelings would change the light and sound patterns, which I would see and hear, which would change the light and sound patterns again, which I would again see and hear, and realize that it was changing my brainwaves with each interval to take on the features in my own brainactivity that my brain was able to recognize, it was like presenting a mirror of the brain to itself.

I didn't have any explanation for this phenoninem, I didn't know how to explain it, I didn't know if it was real, I didn't know if other people experienced it, I didn't know anything except that I needed to keep experimenting with it and I needed to share it with more people.

I did it on myself as many times as a I could, spending hours each day in deep self-awareness thanks this computer program running a reflection of my brain activity back to me as highly stimulating brainwave entrainment beats.
