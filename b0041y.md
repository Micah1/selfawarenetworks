AI Chat Summary: The brain operates as a 3D phase field, where neural oscillations construct reality through synchronized feedback loops, crucial for self-awareness. Spatial volume is learned, not inherent, as the brain dynamically models space through experience. Neural oscillations extend beyond traditional perceptions of particles like electrons, connecting brainwaves to quantum phenomena and magnetic fields. Reality is viewed as an oscillating phase space, where existence is more probable than nothingness. The synchronization of neural arrays, modeled on firefly-like behavior, allows collective sensory processing, enhancing perception. This process is akin to tomographic brainwave storage, where the brain continuously renders internal representations of reality, distinct from holograms but comparable in their reconstructive properties. These oscillations underpin the brainâ€™s ability to perceive, predict, and observe its own processes, central to the Self Aware Networks (SAN) Theory of Mind.

# The Brain as a 3D Phase Field: Perception through Oscillation and Phase Space
## Relevance: This thought experiment underscores the Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind (SAN) by explaining how the brain's oscillatory patterns construct a 3D phase field of reality, crucial for understanding how neural arrays create internal renderings that contribute to self-awareness. The brain creates a 3D phase field of reality via oscillatory patterns, playing a central role in perception and internal self-awareness. The concept of reality as a phase field, compared to a hologram, adds depth to the Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind (SAN).

So, this is a thought experiment.

Imagine that, look at whatever's in front of you.

But imagine that none of this stuff that you see in front of you is really here.

I'm looking at a desk with a bunch of stuff in it.

Some devices are charging.

Lots of cables.

There's some jars.

And over here, a headset.

Looks like there's some milk.

And a protein.

And some supplements.

Some new job apps.

There's a book, Functional Connections of Cortical Areas.

And it is just the case that I'm just going to say,

okay, let's imagine that none of this stuff is really here.

Let's just say that starting from zero description,

where what you described might as well be a hologram.

Here's what I'm saying.

It might as well be a hologram that has,

because what I'm saying is like,

if you imagine that your brain is just detecting information

as it changes in a 3D phase field,

your brain is predicting the change of the world.

It's changed in a 3D phase field.

So it places you in the world in a 3D phase field.

Reality is a 3D phase field.

Your brain is making a 3D phase field.

That represents the world.

Now, is that this 3D phase field is like,

can we say this is like a hologram?

It's like a light field hologram.

That is like a volumetric video

that's being played to yourself live in real time.

And so there's like a volume to your existence.

There's a space around you.

# Spatial Volume is Not Inherent: A Learned Experience of the Brain
## Spatial volume is not an innate feature but rather a learned brain capacity through experience and interaction with the environment. SAN builds on this, exploring how neural arrays dynamically construct space.

But one of my arguments is the volume is not inherent

to your mind.

The volume is something that you've learned

to actually open your eyes the first time.

That's my hypothesis.

I'm just saying like the volume of space,

maybe your brain develops it in the world I don't know.

Maybe.

That's interesting.

But the idea that I have is that it's not,

there's nothing intrinsic to that initial state of consciousness

that requires us to put something in there

that says this unit is going to perceive volume, spatial volume.

What I'm suggesting is that the experience of spatial volume

is the experience of the phase space that has the organism perceives it.

Right?

So the organism is going to see some jars as attractive

and some of the things that it sees like,

oh, well that's actually trash, that's not attractive.

But the fact that I perceive something like trash

is not attractive and something that's an item

that I want to keep as attractive.

It's just interesting the way,

like in your brain may have a different map

but how in terms of how it represents something

that you're looking at, what the meaning of that is to you.

I mean you may have a very different interpretation.

It's just I just made up a story basically

that you can ascribe any emotional attribute.

Like my fan, I feel very happy, this fan is an heirloom.

It does.

It makes me feel really happy.

And I just made that up.

No, I just bought this from Target.

It's not a special fan.

It does have an air purification system taped to it.

Which is supposed to replace it pretty much.

But yeah, you can tape an air filtration system to a fan.

It's pretty useful.

But what I want to say is, what does space mean to you?

I think we have to say, it's an oscillating space field,

that every particle that makes up every atom

and every photon is a oscillating space.

It's like, it is, I would say it's like the,

it's the configuration that space is in,

which is a phase.

Space has different phases.

So it's like, it can take on a state of having an electron.

Which is like, I would say it's like,

imagine an electron is not the,

an electron as we know it is like the peak of the real electron.

I see the real electron is a lot bigger.

I'm just saying, I'm not sure this is correct.

Just imagine, for the sake of an electron,

# "Brainwaves and Magnetic Fields: Enlarging the Concept of the Electron"
## Importance: This helps SAN Theory by linking neural oscillations to quantum phenomena, suggesting that particles like electrons extend into magnetic fields, connecting neural activity to broader oscillatory physics.

imagine the electron is a lot bigger.

And that you can't separate the magnetism from the electron.

And that the whole magnetic wave is part of that electron.

I can imagine that the real size of the electron is actually much bigger.

And that it includes a magnetic wave.

That every electron has a magnetic wave.

That's interesting, right?

And yeah, it's really interesting.

And so I thought, yeah, so we should have like,

definitely have, what is interesting about a phase strip, right?

Okay, let's say that in reality, the phase failure of the table,

right, there's a lot of atoms that make up the table.

And they have a homogenous surface,

and I'm not sure what the right term is, but as a,

I don't know how to describe this, they all,

they're bound in the material, atoms are bound in the material.

And it's, but it's like, here's what I'm saying,

like the atoms themselves, right?

They're just, what I'm trying to get at,

it's like the configuration of space is like this,

the configuration of space is like this magnet

that is in a chaotic oscillation inside a harmonic oscillation, right?

So it's like, okay, so it's like, imagine ideally space is like half on and half off.

# "Phase Fields in Space and Particle Behavior: A Spectrum of Existence"
## Importance: This argument is significant because it presents space as an oscillating field where particles like electrons exist in various phases, linking space-time dynamics to the brain's processing of reality.

But imagine, okay, so that's something interesting,

like imagine it's like, there's four different modes of space,

and there's one that's like off off, one that's on off, one that's on off,

one that's on off, or off off, something like that.

But anyway, the point is like, there's four different modes of space, right?

And the off off is the only one where nothing can exist, right?

And the other one is something could exist while something else doesn't exist.

And then another one is like something doesn't exist while something else doesn't exist.

And that's like another scenario, and then there's like a scenario which two things can't exist, right?

And it's like, so just like, I'm just saying like, what is the like scenario that's most likely,

why is one scenario more likely than another in this scenario, in this Bayesian logic?

Like if there's, if these things could be 50-50, why is it more likely that there's nothing

when that's like one of the many possible configurations?

Just to see what I'm saying.

So it's just that there's almost this argument embedded in the space time, right?

# "Phase Space as the Foundation of Reality: The Argument for Existence"
## Importance: This section is critical because it suggests that the existence of space-time itself is more probable than nothingness, reinforcing the idea that neural systems naturally render some form of reality, essential for the SAN Theory's focus on neural feedback and entification.

Like here, space time exists because the actual probability of nothing existing is so remote

considering all the possibilities, all the infinite possibilities of existence that could exist in theory, right?

It's like almost like space is this argument, right?

It's like, okay, what's more likely?

And because it actually is more likely that some version of reality exists,

some version of reality therefore exists, right?

It's just more likely to be true because out of infinite possibilities, right?

And what's interesting is that if you start this from this fundamental idea that existence isn't more possible

than in existence, therefore existence exists,

then you can get to the, you know, you have to say, well, what kind of existence is this, right?

Like we seem to, from our perspective, we seem to be in a situation where entropy is always increasing.

But at the same time, it does seem like technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated,

which suggests that human beings as a species are evolving as a whole.

That's what it suggests, right?

I would say your brain is not rendering a hologram.

I'm sorry, your brain is rendering a tomogram, a tomogram is conceptually like a hologram but defined by neural coincidence detection, carried by phase differentials (the engram, or echogram), and bound by oscillation.  

It's of reality.

And, but it's just to say that reality is not a hologram.

Reality is a phase field that light can make copies of, right?

A light can make copies of that phase field.

So that phase field is reproduced in the scattering pattern of a phase field

so that when you shine light through it, the hologram is recreated, the light field is recreated.

Right, that's the, so the brain also stores the, there's a matrix of oscillating brain waves.

And they receive inputs from sensory inputs from the world, sensory rays, mounted around your, sensory rays, mounted around your body,

so your eyes have sensory rays in them.

Ganglia neurons are part of the sensory rays, usually.

Your nose has sensory rays in it.

Your ears have sensory rays in it, ganglia neuron sensory rays.

And so all the arrays are made up out of neurons, different types of neurons,

but in essence the neurons are senders and they receive signals and then they transmit signals.

They do it, they're able to combine.

So a neuron has sensory capabilities, but because of the mathematical principles of oscillation

that you should read about in book sync by mathematician Stephen Strogatz,

the, because of the principles of oscillation, neurons can, by synchronizing together,

# Neural Feedback Loops in Brain Perception: Firefly-like Oscillation
## Synchronization within neural networks through oscillation allows for collective sensing and perception, with neurons influencing one another in dynamic feedback loops.

they can combine their, just like fireflies, they can combine their individual sensing abilities into a collective sensing abilities.

So the firefly community, because they all oscillate together,

they basically like, whenever any of them deviates from its standard oscillation,

that changes the phase, the, that sends a knock into all of the other oscillators,

because the signal becomes off.

So let's say one of the fireflies is eaten or one of the fireflies finds food and it comes, you know,

in some way its rate changes.

Either it's excited, or it's excited scared, or it's excited happy, or it's excited, you know, joyful,

or it's depressed in a stress relieving way, or it's depressed in a stressful way,

or it's depressed in a, you know, like it's different, like it's, now it's relaxed,

or now it's taking a nap, and it's like, it's all about what is that interaction signal

that's the phase change when one firefly deviates from its standard oscillation

is felt by the entire collection of fireflies.

They all dissipate that energy across their network, at least as far as the energy, I mean,

if it's so, if the energy is so, so small of a disturbance, it may not go across the entire network,

so maybe the entire network doesn't notice it in that case.

But in essence, what has happened is that this place of neurons aligned in a sensor array,

this layer, inside a column, for example, it is capable of the collective pattern learning, right?

It has multiplied its capabilities, and it has gone to...

Afterthoughts:

in a sense, that we are going to be looking at holograms,

and we are making tomograms in our brains.

So we're going to be making holograms of the tomograms and use them for telecommunication, right? Or tomogram extraction & implantation for brain to brain BCI?
