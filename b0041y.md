Hologram

00:00
So this is the thought except imagine that look at whatever's inside but imagine that that none of this stuff that you're seeing in front of you is really careful. I'm looking at a desk to the bunch of stuff. Now, some devices are charging. That's okay. Holes. There's some charms of your headset.

00:25
So, there's some milk of protein and study supplements. Some, good topics says book, functional characters of quarter areas.

00:48
And it is just the case that I'm just going to say. Okay, let's imagine that none of this stuff is right here. Computer. That even in computers notice, let's just say that.

01:07
Starting from right, zero description or what you described. Minus will be a hologram here. What I'm saying is mine will be hologram that has the has because what I'm saying is like, do you imagine it? Your brain is just detecting information has change in a 3D face. Your brain is predicting for change of the world has changed as included, Facebook.

01:45
So, places you in the world, any 3D face field. Reality is a 3D face. Your brain is missing a 3D face here that represents the world. Now, is that this 3D payout is like can't we say? It's just like a hologram. It's like a light fear of hologram that is like a volumetric video.

02:16
That's being played to yourself live in real time. So there's like a volume to your existence that there's a space around, but but my one of my arguments is the volume is not inherent to your, to your minds thinking that the volume is something that you learned. Actually opened your eyes.

02:45
The first time that's my eye offices. I'm just saying like the volume of space. Maybe your brain develops it in the world. I don't know, maybe it's interest, but that I the idea that I have, I said, it's not there's nothing intrinsic to

03:12
That initial state of consciousness that will requires us to put something in there and says this universe is going to perceive volume spatial blindness. What I'm what I'm suggesting is that the experience of spatial volume is the experience of the phase space that has the organism receives it, right?

03:43
So the organism is, can see some jars as attractive and some, some of the things that it sees like, oh well, that's actually trash. So that's not a problem, right? But the fact that I perceive something is like trash is not attractive and something. It's an item that I want to keep as attractive.

04:05
This is interesting, the way like in your brain may have a different map but how in terms of how it represents something that you're looking at, what the meaning that is to you. I mean, you may have a very different location. It's just, I just made up a story physically that you can.

04:22
You can ascribe any emotional attribute, like my fan. I'm very happy this fan. It's is an heirloom. It does take some really happy and I just made that up. No, I just bought this from Target. It's just not it's not a special fan, it doesn't have an aircraft system, take to it.

05:00
But what I want to say is what a space means to you. I think we have to say it's an oscillating. Pace view that every part of hole that makes up every atom. And every photon is oscillating. Exp. It's like it is, I would say it's like the

05:30
Is the configuration that space is in?

05:37
Which is a phase perfect spaces different phases. Okay? So it's like it can take on like the state of having an electron which is which is like I would say it's like imagine electron is not the does not electron, as we know it is like the peak of the real electron.

06:02
I see the real life. Sounds a lot better, and I'm just saying, well, I'm gonna show this crack, but I'm just imagining it for the sake of it, like, right? Imagine electron is not bigger and that you can't separate the magnet. The magnetism from the electron and that the whole magnetic wave is part of that electron, right?

06:24
I can imagine that the real size of that, really electrons. I see much bigger than it includes a magnetic wave that every electron has a magnetic wave that interesting. Okay. And that's really interesting.

06:45
And so I thought. Yes. So we should have like, definitely have what is interesting about a Facebook right? Okay, let's say that.

07:02
In reality, the face, failure of the table, ready? There's a lot of atoms that make up the table and they have a hamantas surface and a short, right? Turns with it. But as a

07:22
Have subscribers. They, they all they're bound in the material. Atoms are bound in the materials. And it's but it's like here's what I'm saying. Like the items themselves, right? They're just.

07:46
What I'm trying to get at. It's like the configuration of space is like this that there's some spaces like this that it's like magnet that is and a chaotic oscillation.

08:21
Inside our harmonic oscillation, right? So it's like okay so it's like imagine that ideally space is.

08:33
Right. Half on and half off but I'm imagine. Okay. So no, that's something interesting. Like, imagine, it's like there's four different modes of space and there's one that's like, off-off when it's on when it's on off and it's on off, or off on, something like that. But anyway, the point is like there's four different most space, right?

09:02
And the off-off is the only one where nothing can accept, right? And the other one is something that exists. While something else doesn't and then another one is like something that something doesn't exist. While something else doesn't sense. And it's like a net second, another scenario. And then there's like scenario, which two things can exist, right?

09:29
And it's like so just just like I'm just saying like what is the like scenario it's most likely, why is one scenario more likely than another and a scenario. And this patient logic. Wait, if there's if these things could be 50/50, why is it more likely that there's nothing?

09:52
When that's like one of the many possible configurations, just your thing. And,

10:11
So it's it's just that it's just that there's almost this argument

10:24
Embedded in this space time right? Like like here space time exists because the actual probability of nothing existing is so remote considering all the possibilities, all the infinite possibilities of existence that could exist in theory, right? It's like, almost like space spaces is argument, right? Like okay, what's more likely?

10:57
And because it actually is more likely, that some version of reality exists, some version of reality therefore exists, right? It's just it's just more likely to be true because out of infinite out of infinite possibilities, right? And what's interesting is that you if you start this from this fundamental abide idea, that existence is a more plausible than in existence therefore existence exists.

11:30
Then you can get to the

11:41
The even I mean, I mean this is just, you know, you have to you say, well, what kind of existence is this right? Like, or we seem to from our perspective because we seem to be in a situation where entropy is always increasing. But at the same time, it does seem like technologies becoming increasingly sophisticated which should just that human beings as a species are evolving as a whole.

12:11
That's what they suggest, right? I say you're your brain is not rendering a hologram. I'm sorry. You're brain is rendering a hologram engram or ectogram, it's a reality and but it's this is a that reality is not a hologram reality, is a face feel that light can make coffee, so, right?

12:52
So it's not like light can make a copy of that face wheel. So that facial reproduce and the scattering pattern of the face feels. So that when you shine light through it, the hologram is, recreated the light filters restraining, right? That. That's the.

13:15
So the brain also stores, the they are. There's a matrix of oscillating brainwaves and they receive inputs from sensory, inputs from the world to her. Raise mounted around your sensor, raise mounted around your body. So your eyes have sensors are raising them dangly and neurons are part of the sensor arrays.

13:49
Usually your nose has sensor raised in it. Your ears have sensor arrays in it, gingly neuron tensor rates and so all the arrays are made up out of out of neurons different types of neurons but in essence that neurons are senders and they're they receive signals and then they transmit signals.

14:15
They they do it. They're able to combine so when you're on a sensory capability but because of the mathematical mathematical principles of oscillation, you should read about and book sink by my mathematician. Stephen Strogets the because of the principles of oscillation neurons can by synchronizing together, they can combine their just like fireflies.

15:01
They can combine their individual sensing ability into a collective sensing abilities. So the firefly community because they all oscillate together. They basically like whenever any of them deviates from its standard oscillations that changes the face. The vet sends a knock into all of the other oscillators because the signal signal becomes off, right?

15:32
So let's say one of the fireflies is eaten or one of the fireplaces finds food and it comes, you know, in some way it's rate changes either it's excited or it's excited to scared or it's excited. Happy or decided to know joyful or it's depressed and a stress relieving way or a suppressed and a stressful way or a suppressant.

15:56
Yeah. Like there's different things. Like it's now it's relaxed or now. It's taking a nap and it's like, it's all about. What is that interaction signal? That's the base change when one firefly did it from. Its standard oscillation is about by the entire collection of fireflies. They all dissipate that energy across their network, at least as far as it energy.

16:30
I mean if it's still if the energy is so so small of a disturbance, it may not go across the entire network. So maybe the entire network doesn't notice it and that case. But in essence, what has happened is that this place of neurons? Aligned in a sensor. Array the layer inside.

16:53
A column, for example, it is capable of the of collective pattern learning, right? It has multiplied, its capability and it has gone to

17:26
In a sense that we are going to be looking at holograms and we are making holograms in our brain. So we're going to be making holograms of heart of the holograms that we're using for telecommunication.

18:50
But like, how much cleanup the communication is being when you like some communicate with holograms, right? That's like real, like rain to brain. And communication. How many of us do that right now anyways? Right? Like what if I like, what if I could draw a shape to describe the relationship the relationships between people, right?
