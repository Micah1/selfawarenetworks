The article explores the benefits of a new technology called Cerebell for expedited EEG analysis in hospitals. Developed by a neurologist in Southern California, Cerebell aims to address the issue of undetected non-convulsive status epilepticus in hospital settings. Unlike the complex and obstacle-prone traditional model for EEG acquisition, Cerebell offers a simple and convenient solution. It consists of a wearable headband with 10 electrodes that provide quick and easy access to brainwave signals. With Cerebell, there is no need for a technician, allowing for immediate EEG analysis. Additionally, the device incorporates AI algorithms that accurately detect electrographic seizures and send alerts to healthcare professionals. The article also highlights other innovative technologies in the field, such as neural headphones and Neuralink's brain-computer interface, emphasizing their potential in improving healthcare. The assistant engages in a conversation about non-invasive and invasive detection techniques, spatial and temporal resolution, and the impact of sugar consumption on neurological health. Overall, the article underscores the significance of innovative technologies in neuroscience research and healthcare.

# <b>Role of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in COVID-19</b>

The article delves into the role of inflammation and oxidative stress in COVID-19. It emphasizes the degradation of the endothelial lining caused by the virus attaching to the ACE2 receptor. This degradation shares similarities with the effects of oxidative stress, which can harm cells and tissues. The author suggests that treating oxidative stress could be a potential treatment for COVID-19. They mention N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) as a means to increase glutathione production and reduce oxidative stress. The article also discusses the potential benefits of a natural supplement called Protandim, which can modulate inflammation and boost glutathione production. The author acknowledges ongoing research and clinical trials to better understand the relationship between oxidative stress, inflammation, and COVID-19. The article briefly touches on the impact of COVID-19 on the brain, suggesting that the virus affects the brain, leading to cognitive disorders and other neurological symptoms. The importance of nitric oxide in the brain's response to the virus and the potential role of the lymphatic system in brain inflammation are mentioned. Ongoing studies are mentioned to further investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the brain. Overall, the article provides insights into the significance of inflammation and oxidative stress in COVID-19 and the potential for treating these factors to mitigate the disease's effects.

# <b>Therapeutic Potential of Proxellumetide for COVID-19 Treatment</b>

This scientific article explores the potential use of a therapeutic agent called proxellumetide for treating COVID-19. Proxellumetide is delivered through inhalatory exosomes containing the CD24 protein. The article suggests that proxellumetide, along with similar therapies, works by down-regulating the inflammatory pathway NF-kappa B. It selectively suppresses cytokines that inhibit endothelial nitric oxide production, mimicking the effects of estrogen. Increasing nitric oxide availability may help reduce viral load and act as an antioxidant. The article also mentions a study that detected microvascular damage in patients with long COVID, indicating that damage to the brain's lymphatic system and endothelial lining may contribute to the disease. Furthermore, the article discusses inflammation and oxidative stress as potential markers for COVID-19 brain damage. The author hypothesizes that tracking rapid changes in blood flow using imaging techniques could help identify these markers. The importance of antioxidants like N-acetyl cysteine and glutathione peroxidase in mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress is also discussed. Overall, the article suggests that COVID-19 may be a brain disease that affects the vasculature, lymphatic system, and endothelium, leading to inflammation and other symptoms. Further research is needed to explore these hypotheses and develop effective treatments.

# OpenAI Whisper Transcription: 

other than just I'm really excited that this technology has finally arrived on the scene

after waiting for decades for something like this, probably one of the neatest advances

because it really helps to improve the automated detection of non-convulsed status epileptics

which is a real problem that goes undetected often in the hospital setting.

The web address, again, Sean, was that c-e-r-e-b-e-l dot com?

You're close, Micah. C-e-r-i-b-e-l-l dot com.

I think this is actually put together by a neurologist in Southern California and it

addresses the current problem that we have in the hospital setting of the unmet need

of rapid expedited brainwave pattern detection. If you look at the current model for getting

electroencephalography in the hospital, it is fraught with obstacles. There are probably

literally a dozen different things that can get in the way of actually acquiring brainwave

signals quickly. You can do blood pressure, you can get a pulse ox, you can get somebody's

temperature within seconds, but our most important organ in the body can be clocked

away underneath the surface of the skull, seizing away with no external manifestations, and

we may be oblivious to it. To me, this is an absolutely groundbreaking disruptive technology

that is going to change the paradigms moving forward for getting expedited EEG analysis

in the hospital setting.

Oh, interesting. Yeah, so it looks like you've got a headband with 10 electrodes and they

just sort of wrap around. So it's not a cap. I mean, it's not like a traditional.

Yeah, it certainly seems very interesting. I just googled it. So what do you guys think

about wearable neuro devices? I know cardiac devices are very in right with apple watches

and ECG algorithms. I recently saw these ads for neural which is like a device or headphones

you wear and I don't know how accurate they'll be, but they'll give you EEG signals and kind

of show when you're working, whether you're in like good beta waves or when you need a

break or it kind of a lot, you okay, now your brain waves are changing, you need a break.

I don't know how accurate it's going to be, but what are your or everybody's thoughts

on that? And if somebody's tried like a wearable device before in the neuro space?

Well, I just want to say that Cerebell is also a wearable device that we're saying I'm

sort of like I think so I think it's of interest everybody because it's the same sort of the

same same topic that both of you just brought up. And I guess I was on mute, but I was trying

to say that I'm noticing that Cerebell CRI BELL is a 10 channel or 10 sensor EEG headband

that that looks like a regular, I mean, I guess it wraps around like a sweat like it

like a sweatband. What makes it different? I'm just curious, what makes us stand out?

Good question, Mike. And I agree with you. It is technically speaking a wearable. I mean,

if somebody were really motivated to get their hands on one piece and track their own seizure

potential if they had epilepsy, for example. So what makes it different and stand out? Well,

for one thing, just the ease of use, you know, a standard electroencephalogram requires a

technician and a lot of messy glue that smells really noxious to apply the electric leads

to the scalp. They can fall off easily. You can get a lot of electrical artifact. It's

just a very cumbersome thing to get an EEG. And the fact that it requires a technician

means that it's not always available 24 hours a day. Many institutions don't even have

an EEG technician. There's a lot of noise that can come from the system. Just countless

barriers that get in the way. So this is very convenient. The electrodes pop on very easily.

It wraps around the scalp in a minute. And before you know it, anybody, you know, can

put this on a patient. So a doctor who's not a neurophysiologist or a nurse at the bedside

could put this on in the ER or in the ICU. So really, you don't need a technician. It

uploads the signal to the cloud where a neurologist can read it from home or in Geneva or wherever

he or she is. So instant access. And then another aspect of it that's really intriguing

is that it has AI algorithms built into it that have a very high degree of positive predictive

value and high sensitivity, high specificity for detecting electrical, electro-graphic

seizures. So even in the best of circumstances, normally, if a patient is seizing, it will

require the technician to get a neurologist on the phone, describe what's going on. The

neurologist will have to leave clinic or wherever he or she is and come take a look at the machine

and make a determination here with this AI algorithm. It will actually set off an alarm

right there at the bedside so that if the seizure is taking place, again, you know,

you don't need a neurologist necessarily to read the EEG.

Yeah, it looks like this device is intended for the point of care for a hospital or specifically

a nurse, perhaps. Okay. Yeah, so it's a bit different, I guess, in terms of what you might

expect from something like OpenBCI, which I guess you wouldn't expect to see something

like OpenBCI in a hospital, it being used for the EEG detect, I mean, for seizure detections.

Yeah, I would agree with you on that. I think, you know, this is an FDA-approved device,

so the company's obviously invested a lot of time and energy in demonstrating its safety

and effectiveness, and I think we're still a ways away from BCI, you know, hitting mainline

clinical productions other than in very specific instances such as for correction of Parkinson's

and tremor or people with cervical dystonia, and those are quite involved in specialized

service lines of delivery. So in terms of, you know, BCI wearables that you're probably,

to Pooja's question, I think you're going to see those to be a more popular wellness-oriented

market that you're looking at there. Okay. Pooja, did you have more thoughts on that?

No, I love all your points. Seems I think what she's describing is more for hospital-based

thing, but I agree that wearable neuro-devices are going to become more commonplace because

there's this big fascination to know for everything, for most people, what's going on in your body,

like heart rate, heart rate variability, which somehow ties to neuro-coherence and then neuroplasticity.

So I think there's just going to be a lot more things coming out, and I'd be excited

to hear if you guys have seen something or in the pipeline that's coming out. I saw this

wearable device, which was just headphones. Have you guys seen something else in the pipeline?

I could also ask, has everyone seen that new video that Neuralink put out with the monkey

in there? Yeah, yeah, that one. Yeah, it's quite striking, and reminds me 35, 40 years

ago or longer than that when Pong first came out and how my brother and I were just entranced

as kids. It always brings back that feeling now to see him playing himself with this BCI.

But I think, Pooja, there's a number of different devices that are working the way through the

wellness market that don't require FDA approval using electrical conductance to gently stimulate

cortical function and maybe take advantage of neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Probably

where you're going to see more of the really exciting advancements are in the FDA approved

market where we're using transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation

to elicit specific changes in the lateral prefrontal cortex and people who are suffering

from depression, OCD, schizophrenia, PTSD, a lot of really exciting research going on

there. You may want to check out Brainsway. Brainsway has got a pretty good product model

delivery system for that modality. Cool, for sure, I'll check it out. Thank you.

So the happy hour part of the title is kind of like this invitation for people to share

what they want to share. So if no one else wants to lead, I'm open to if Sean wants to

go through the list of the new devices. What I would do then is just make a list of them

to share with everybody afterwards. And I'll post it on Twitter afterwards. Sean, if you

want to talk about what you're seeing, I'm fine with that.

Sure. It's a pretty crazy list. I mean, thank you, Michael, for the opportunity. I appreciate

it. So, hi, John. Before you start, let me just check in with a few things. So there's

this clubhouse like person, I think Jason Ma started a neurosurgery club, and he also

made me one of the hosts. So apparently there are many subscriptions. How can I invite you

guys like Dr. Sean and Dr. Raul, and just search the club, Neurosurgery, so that you

can follow and I'll invite you to the club. And also, given the name of the title, there's

a physics in there. So for me, it's a long time question that I just, the new title reminds

me of my interest in the Weber Frescher. Does that ring a bell? You can Google, you can

see, follow the Wikipedia link on the psychophysics law of Weber and the Frescher. It essentially

says, our senses, be it vision, or to other touch, focus in logarithm, instead of linear.

So then, the next question to ask is, what is the neuron-based or the neuroscience scientific

space of the slot, right? Apparently there's some research went on, like in this direction

recently, it has recently, you know, 15 years, I believe. So if the room, if the experts

in the room can comment on that. Also, can someone explain the neural link, the Pong

game, what's going on? I just saw the view and a little bit confused. So it seems that

the monkey is sucking on some rewards, juice, and also at the same time playing the game.

I didn't search exhaustive, because I didn't know what's the setup.

Sure. So the monkey is being given a milkshake through the metal straw. And the monkey is

also initially moving the cursor with the joystick. And every time the monkey moves

the cursor to the light on the screen, the monkey is given a little bit more milkshake.

And so the light moves somewhere else and the monkey moves the cursor to it, it gets

a little bit more milkshake. And while that's happening, the neural link device that has

been implanted in the head is recording signals and sending those signals to the phone. And

so after a while, the device has trained on the data coming from the device in the brain.

And what they do then is they unplug the joystick so that the monkey will continue to play the

game and it will continue to use the joystick as if basically moving the cursor to where

the light is on the screen. But now the only way for the cursor to get there is because

the signals from the brain in the neural link device are being transmitted to the phone.

And that's the only way that the monkey is able to interact with the computer. But the

monkey is still moving the hand and still moving the joystick because it doesn't know

that this transition has taken place. But you can see in the video that the joystick

has been implugged at that point. And so that's stage two, the joystick was unplugged

and the monkey is controlling it with its brain, it doesn't know it. Stage three is

they take the joystick completely away from the monkey. So it's not even in the picture

anymore. But the monkey continues to play the game with just its mind. And I guess we

don't know if the monkey thinks that somehow by holding on to the straw that it's somehow

able to cause the... It's not clear for me if the monkey really understands that the

mind is what's controlling. Because maybe there's some confusion with whether the straw

is helping the monkey to control the cursor on the screen. I don't know. But it's really

interesting. There was no visible cable that was coming out of the skull. How was the detector

connected to the monkey? So Neuralink, you can see on the monkey that the part of the

head was shaved. And Neuralink is a wireless device. So it has a... What happens is after

the sensors are implanted, there's a wire that runs over the surface of the brain and

it runs down to the area behind the ear. And then that is connected to a Bluetooth device

somewhere behind the ear. And then there's a device outside of it that would be where

you might put a battery, I think. It sort of like attaches behind the ear. But at that

point, it's transmitting to the phone wirelessly. So you're not going to say cable with a Neuralink

device. It's using Bluetooth, I think.

So just one more question. I've been attending these neurophysics rooms and I'm in particular

interested in the enhancement of spatial and temporal resolution of detectors that track

the neurons firing. And where is this Neuralink in terms of spatial and temporal resolution

in relation to an fMRI or E-cog or F.

Well, it's way beyond those two. In fact, it's in a class of its own. So E-cog is putting

a grid of electrodes on the surface of the brain. But this is putting sensors, this is

injecting sensors into the brain tissue between blood vessels with the kind of precision that

only a robot can handle surgically. And it's using, oh, and the meat. So let me invite

Scott up here. So yeah, we're just, so the electrodes are smaller than human hair. There's

about, I think, I think there's like 10, I forget, but it might have been something

like 10 electrodes per thing and like 10, gosh, I have to look it up. But it's like,

let's see, how many electrodes? I'm just going to type this in my computer real quick

to see if I get a fast answer. Electrodes on Neuralink. So okay, so I guess the initial

arrays were thought, maybe you could have close to 3,702 electrodes per array in the

first versions. Let's see if I can. Alright, is the question, how many are on the monkey

and the mind-bomb thing? The spatial resolution and the number of electrodes. I don't know

the spatial resolution, but I just saw a video that said it was 1024 electrodes per Neuralink

and there were two Neuralink swans on each hemisphere. Sorry, that's not shanks because

there's 16 electrodes on each shank. There's 16 electrodes on each chain? On each shank.

So for each penetration, I think there's 16 contacts for a total of 1024 contacts per

hemisphere. Okay. And the depth of penetration is somehow calibrated beforehand and then

I don't know if these are making anything stupid. I don't know. Yes, yeah, the depth

of calibration is calibrated ahead of time. It goes several millimeters into the brain

at the level of the cortex. They're working out models now where they're going to be

able to take it deep to the subcortical structures. Part of the advantage of using the robotic

approach is that they can avoid the major complication of deep brain stimulation, which

is bleeding. These electrodes are a tiny fraction of the size of most deep brain stimulator

electrodes and being very tiny and filamentous, of course, you can imagine they would break

very easily in the hand. So the spatial resolution is incredible. It's like nothing that's been

invented before. And the idea here is to get a very high fidelity reading from cortical

neurons so that it very closely approximates real time signal processing.

I want to agree with that in terms of like, it's far beyond MRI and it's far faster than

MRI. It's much higher resolution. It's like individual neurons. But I think that there

was a project that was called Neural Dust where they injected and also optogenetics,

right? In both cases, they're manipulating, they're modifying single neurons so they

can manipulate single neurons. And I mean, I guess, yeah, I don't know if you, I don't

know how to compare the resolution to optogenetics. You just can't, you can't really do optogenetics

in human being, right?

Hi, I mean, technically you could, Mike. The problem is that from an ethical perspective,

it's a little challenging. It requires a viral vector to transfect neurons to start with.

And with optogenetics, you're looking more at a control feedback, you know, modifying

behavior using input of light into the brain as opposed to sensing so much what's going

on. So they're really different modalities. The Neural Dust idea is a very neat idea.

And I think Ray Kurzweil was one of the early proponents of that. And the idea was to be

able to use, you know, essentially millimeter-sized devices that could either swarm in a high

fashion. But I think part of the problem was, you know, getting that, getting information

in and out. They just hadn't been able to devise the right kind of I.O. platform to

be able to facilitate the Neural Dust. But they were being manufactured on a micrometer

scale, so you're right about that.

A quick comment on the optogenetics. Another thing worth bringing up is optogenetics works

great in mice, but all mice are basically almost clones of each other in the lab mice.

The labs that we're trying to get opto to work in monkeys starting like 10 years ago

or so, you get way more issues due to genetic variability because monkeys are not all clones

of each other. And so some monkeys would work and some monkeys wouldn't. I think immune

responses were a big issue there. So in humans with even more genetic variability than monkeys,

you're going to run into stuff like that.

That's good to know. Yeah, I mean, I guess one of the things that's been touted about

Neural Inc. was that the size of the electrodes and the fact that they're designed to miss

blood vessels, maybe that could reduce scarring and make it possible to leave it in longer

and have it still be effective for a long time.

Are there any invasive modes that's been researched? It seems like you could somehow take the reflections,

echoes from different layers, possibly even doing some kind of a stereoscopic stimulation.

Is there anything like that?

Did anyone else? Sorry, I sort of missed the question. Would you rephrase it? Maybe a

little louder? So I come from an instrumentation background. And every time I join Neural Physics

rooms, I get frustrated because a lot of stuff that people talk about are very indirect and

then people say, I feel like I feel bad. I just want to see it. So I've been looking

for different progress in instrumentation. And so these rubies are great, great thing.

Thank you very much for setting it up. And I guess the ultimate goal is to be able to

understand at a granular level how the individual neurons firing gets all, gets into a larger

group and then turns into certain things that we can actually experience. And so there's

a lot of problems with invasive detection. And it seems like we also have a problem with

a temporal resolution of these detectors. So twofold. One is, are there any non-invasive

detection research going on? That's number one, number two is, am I just totally off envisioning

a time maybe 10 years from now, maybe 50 years from now when we could actually point a telescope

type of thing to the person's head and be able to actually see what's going on at the

neural level? Sean, do you want to? Go ahead, Scott, if you want to.

Can I just clarify? Are you asking what are the current cutting edge non-invasive techniques

to read out neural activity? Is that the question?

Yes.

I could name a couple. I'm sure other people could. I think, so one thing that's using sound

or something is optical coherence tomography. I mean, there's not like, that hasn't picked

up much. You know, I mean, I'm excluding like fMRI because you have to be in like a big

magnet for that. But like, you know, EEG has been around forever, but just the electrical

noise is, what, I'm sorry?

If I understand correctly, fMRI does not give you this like a one second latency and doesn't

give you a temporal resolution that's necessary because these things apply on your 10 hertz

to like 20 hertz.

Yeah, yeah. So, so for the high temporal resolution, you're going to have, you could have like

EEG, but now you lose your spatial resolution. So there's always a trade off. But I went

to a talk by Mary Lou Jepsen, who was kind of touting this new thing where they are getting

like, could get possibly high resolution by using perhaps, I think it's infrared that's

coming out of like, it put it simply like a little like a hat or like a beanie is the

idea and that they have defined spatial resolution because of the how many pixels you can get

due on like LCD using LCD technology that how flat screens have so much more pixels

than they used to.

So if you shape this into sort of like a hat and and use infrared and in some cases combining

it with with with sound, they're able to sort of pick up resolution. But that's that's

like a private company called like open water, I think I coincidentally know a lot about

that company. I don't know if people want me to share, but I'll let you keep talking

and keep on.

Yeah, I was just going to say that and there's more. But yeah, like there's nothing great

that's has great temporal and spatial specificity that I at least that I know of that's commonly

used.

Thank you.

I'm Sean, I bet you have someone who's it to yeah, I actually helped to launch a company

out of Israel back in 2014 that used a combination of laser light and Doppler to image brain

blood flow.

So I think, Carl, kind of what you're getting at here is is the trickiness that that we

face when you're trying to interpret sazonals, you know, electroencephalogram is one modality

that we try to use to infer what's going on at the neuronal level. Functional MRI is another

but functional MRI depends on blood flow.

So we have something called the neurovascular unit where the idea here is that when a neuron

becomes more metabolically active, not sensibly because it's engaging in more firing activity.

That activity requires more consumption of glucose and oxygen, which then of course requires

a greater amount of blood flow to that neuron.

So the neurovascular unit is the coupling of the blood flow, the blood vessel, the arterial

blood flow blood vessel to the neuron itself. And functional MRI can take advantage of that

increase in essentially glucose and oxygen delivery to be able to represent indirectly

electrical activity, but there are temporal limitations.

The advantage to laser doppler is that we can get almost instantaneous signal representation

of brain blood flow changes. Probably its greatest limitation is the depth of penetration

into the stalling of the brain tissue is somewhat limited by power. If you increase the power

of doppler too much, you can actually damage underlying brain tissue and blood vessels.

But in terms of trying to get a very high temporal resolution, it's almost instantaneous

feedback and closely parallels that what we see on the electroencephalogram.

So that helps.

Thank you.

And then, Sean, if you want to list some of the other devices that you were, you were

going to list earlier, I can write them down as you go ahead.

Yeah, sure. I think from the therapeutic standpoint, in addition to transcranial magnetic stimulation,

we're also seeing transcranial direct current stimulation as a therapeutic modality. It's

probably less studied, but the idea here is pretty much the same. And that is that if

we pass electrical currents through the skull into the underlying brain tissue, it stimulates

neuronal activity. And so there's a principle of the brain that most many people have heard

of, and that is neuroplasticity. And neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to adapt to changing

the circumstances and alter its connections. So neurons that fire together, wire together,

as we say. And if there's a demand on brain function that requires us to learn or to adapt,

neuroplasticity makes that possible. So we can take advantage of that principle of neuroplasticity

and kind of hack it for good reasons using TMS and TBCS, which are two different modalities

that are now currently available on the marketplace. We can look at other forms of therapeutics,

I think that cerebral entrainment, there are a number of different devices on the marketplace.

And you'll see this if you go to physical medicine or rehabilitation conferences where

they try to use infrared or near infrared light to stimulate the optic nerve in synchrony

with auditory stimulation. The idea here is that if you have somebody who's suffering

from depression, they may be neuro-adapted to a rather low level of energy, you can again

kind of hack their system by introducing a higher level frequency. So alpha or low beta

frequency waveforms to just improve their neuronal excitability and keep the mood. There's

some evidence that you can definitely stimulate increased levels of dopamine and serotonin

using this idea of cerebral entrainment. So those are probably, in terms of at least

what's available in clinical production from the therapeutics standpoint, those are available.

Probably one that looks like Carl left the group, but if he comes back, he can let him

know, Micah, that magneto-electroencephalography probably is where he would be interested.

This is a setup that combines MRI with EEG at the same time using ferromagnetic components

in the EEG leads that are compatible with the MRI and do not interfere with the image

quality. So we can now actually image the brain using MRI at the same time that we're

also giving synchronous information from the electroencephalogram. So much higher, tighter

temporal resolution and so it's a very interesting modality.

Thanks, Son. Can I ask a question if you know the answer? What do you lose when you start

it? I guess what do you lose when you mix the two together? Is it just like the EEG

part of it, the contacts are a little less specific or?

Frank, I don't know that, oh, is this, Frank Tucker, Scott, sorry, Scott, I don't know that

you necessarily lose anything. I think the, you know, before these specific setups were

created, it was essentially technologically not possible to do an EEG inside a conventional

MRI machine. And I don't know if you've ever been in an MRI machine. I almost personally

lost a stethoscope into an MRI more one time and that would have probably ended my career

as a budding young neuroscientist to make such a casual mistake. But anything that has

a ferromagnetic quality to it essentially can impair the quality of the signal that's

coming from the MRI. So yeah, I've heard the horror stories from

grad students, like how careful you have to be. I was just curious, maybe like materials

person would know this, like if you're not using magnetic metal electrode, are there

a non-magnetic electrodes that are as conductive or not, I guess?

Right. Yeah, no good question. I see what you're asking. So basically with the magnetoencephalography,

the leads are usually titanium. I mean, they're not as conductive as, you know, copper lead,

for example, but usually you get about the same quality of information. So it's not even

close to the kind of fidelity of EEG signal that you would get, let's say from Neuralink.

I mean, there's an extraordinary, but... That's penetrating, though, that's not, yeah.

Right, yeah. So, you know, I think you could probably say making the electroencephalography

is good enough to get some really interesting answers. You know, but I don't know, I kind

of feel like we're poised for, you know, a disruptive jump in technological innovation

here. There's a new brand that have to look it up. We now actually have the ability to

get bedside MRIs. A new device just rolled out last year that you can put it in an ICU.

It's basically an MRI in a box, which is something I've fantasized about for 20 years. So I'm

really excited to see that come to fruition. And in terms of the quality of EEG signal,

we're just seeing improvements take place all the time, so... Yeah, I think we're poised

to probably see convergence of a variety of different technologies. And, you know, when

you throw AI in there and machine learning, I just envision our capability to do things

and the ICU setting is going to, or the hospital setting is going to jump dramatically here

soon.

Also, you were talking about mixing EEG and fMRIM. But what, from my understanding, magnetoelectroencephalography

is the, is like, that's the one where, so with EEG, it's better with to pick up signals

from the solchi, I think, and then with MEG, it's better to pick up signals from the gyri,

or it could be vice versa, because one's directly reading out the electric field, and the other

one's reading out the magnetic field. But I think EEG makes it that fMRIS, that's something

else, right? That's not related, is it?

You're correct. Yeah, I don't know that we really have the ability to co-locate EEG with

fMRI. I mean, maybe there's somebody who's doing it, I'm just not aware of it. But, you

know, functional MRI is essentially a traditional magnet, and really what we're looking at there

is what we call blood oxygen level delivery, which is something that's very susceptible

to ferromagnetic interference. You know, if somebody has a small hemorrhage even into

the cortex of the brain, the hemocidrin that's left over in the brain tissue can interfere

with the signal-act position for a functional MRI. So we would not typically do any EEG

at the same time as a functional MRI. With magnetoencephalography, really we are mapping

out brain activity, and we're recording magnetic fields largely that are occurring throughout

the brain. And so, you know, what we're trying to do is challenge a participant with a particular

perceptual or cognitive challenge and localize where in the brain is that challenge mapping

to with the most electromagnetic activity. So it really is an interesting, a different

way of looking at the signals that we're getting from functional MRI.

Okay. And so, does anyone want to talk more about Mary Lou Jeffsson that was brought up

earlier, or we could go into, I don't know, if Sean, if you wanted to mention, I know

that you have no interest in, no financial interest in promoting any of these companies,

but if you want to mention them for references, we could, I can make lists of anything you

want to mention specifically.

You know what, Mike, I might just, you know, kind of think of best of brand here. You know,

when you think about transcranial magnetic stimulation, this is an area where there's

a lot of innovation taking place quickly because there's such a big market for it. You know,

I might direct your participants to check out the movie, The Sunshine, or I think it's

the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. So, the movie that came out probably about

15 years ago, very beautiful, sad story that kind of gets into the whole issue of mental

illness and what happens when you just want to erase the memory of a loved one from your

brain. And back then, and this was 2003, 2004, sounded very fantastical, but the truth is

we're kind of getting to that point now where we don't have the precision to erase, you

know, to modulate specific memories, but to overall change the resting state of the brain

and nudge it towards a more physiologically beneficial level function. We're there. So,

if you look up Brandsway, probably is, I think, best of brand for transcranial magnetic stimulation.

There's a few others as well. Neurostar, seems like they've got a good product. But these

are all kind of, you can follow them, follow them out of the category of coming soon to

a city near you. If your city doesn't have a device now, it probably will soon, usually

psychiatrists or neurologists who are employing these four people that's resistant to treatment

depression.

So, on that note, so I've read a few horror stories. And, you know, you got to take some

of those things you hear with the grain of salt. Obviously, there's a lot of crazy stories

in the world in general. But what I'm saying is that, like, so the comparison I heard was

– so, were you saying, Sean, that people are losing memories by comparing it to this

plotless mind, that people – that there's a – go ahead.

Yeah, no, I mean, I guess theoretically that could be a side effect of using this device

if, you know, one theoretical or, well, one practical side effect of using TMS is inducing

seizures. It's not common, but it can happen because you are depolarizing large numbers

of neurons at the same time. And so, when you lower the threshold for depolarization,

it makes it easier for seizure activity to take place. So, and then seizures could theoretically

cause amnesia.

I'm curious about the horror stories you've heard. I mean, every once in a while, I do

read a report where somebody had a bad effect, but I've seen largely really good reports

of experience.

Yeah. Back in the days when it wasn't about neuroscience, it was about psychology, right?

Like, I guess it's the 60s and 70s. And there was a tech – it was called electroconvulsive

therapy, right? And so they put – they shocked your brain with electricity. And so the horror

story that I read was trying to compare, basically, like – is trying to compare TMS to like

a new form of electroconvulsive therapy in principle. I guess it's much more specific.

The amount of current is much more, like, specific. The direction of where the current

supply is much more specific. But they were saying that – they were saying that a lot

of people have very positive responses from it, but a few people don't. And at least

one person wrote – let me write this down. I mean, so TMS, or I'm just going to go with

that and see if it comes up.

But I tried – okay, so the article's called, I think – there's more than a few. So

one of them is, I tried TMS. I tried transcribing magnetic stimulation. Then one says, too good

to be true how – I think this must have been too good to be true, how TMS damaged

my brain. Now, but like I said, this guy was saying that – so I'm sort of skimming

the article. And by the way, feel free to just speak up and I'll mute myself. But

I'm sort of skimming the article. So he was saying that the nurses encouraged him to take

like the maximum dose. And then he started to have – his symptoms started over the

next few weeks. His symptoms became worse and he developed a disturbing new symptoms.

And including some terrifying hallucinations, he developed tendonitis. And he was – yeah,

so anyway, so maybe look up this article. I don't know if I should list it on Twitter

or something if you've been finding. That's the effect on that.

I think it's good to be balanced because any time a new technology is deployed in this

environment, we are in a way experimenting with something that's very new, relatively

speaking. And so who knows? It's not for everybody. And the problem here is that with

a new technology like TMS, we don't really have a way necessarily predicting who's going

to be a good responder and who's not. I think it gets challenging because when you

think about behavioral health and mental illness, many times people who are suffering

from let's say depression, especially treatment-resistant depression, may have something else that's

going on. There may be an autoimmune neurological disorder that's taking place. It could be

undiagnosed multiple sclerosis. It could be dealing with some other neurotransmitter deficiency,

vitamin B12 deficiency. Probably B12 deficiency is the most common thing that I see in my

clinical practice that leads to a wide range of neurological symptoms that also have mental

health implications. So you can imagine that somebody who may have an uncorrected underlying

physiological abnormality then goes through a physiological stress. So like TMS may get

worse because they have an underlying problem that hasn't been addressed. So I really feel

like these therapies have to be done in a comprehensive holistic approach. I'm seeing

these centers popping up around the country where you can almost imagine that they're

going to turn into conveyor belt care because there's a profit motive for using these technologies

now. But really I think they need to be done in a comprehensive holistic setting where

you're addressing all those factors so you get the best outcomes possible.

So I have a hypothesis why electrical stimulation whether it's TDCS or TMS may actually be the

wrong treatment for some depression, for some patients with depression. And those patients

would be experiencing depression because basically they're having a metabolic disorder where

their cells are not able to produce enough energy, enough ATP. So for example, there

was a book that I read that, it was just a layman's book, it was about how people who

have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome and depression, they might be able to, basically

there's like 20 different things they can try. And one of those things was like D-ribbous

because D-ribbous is, if you take it, like I think it was like five grams a day, many

patients saw like an improvement in their energy and in their happiness and a reduction

in their fibromyalgia and a reduction in their chronic fatigue syndrome. And the explanation

was that it was helping the body to produce more energy, more ATP. And I forget how to,

I always forget how to pronounce ATP, but D-ribbous, yeah, that's it. And that's it.

No, you're definitely on the right track there, Micah. If you think about sleep, why is sleep

so important to us? You know, we can get way into the weeds talking about REM and dream

interpretation, et cetera, but from a functional standpoint, sleep is when our brain turns

on the lymphatic system. So until 2014, we did not think that the brain had its own lymphatic

drainage system. We just couldn't see it. You could take a biopsy of muscle tissue, for

example, and under a microscope, you could see these small little lymphatic tubes that

will help to drain muscle tissue of, you know, lymph tissue, which is really waste products

and immune complexes. But to REM 2014, researchers in Virginia were studying patients using MRI

when they would sleep and found that, lo and behold, when they would go to sleep, this

whole lymphatic system would turn on the brain. And we discovered that that lymphatic system

was made up of glial cells, which are supporting cells in the brain. So they were given the

nickname the glimphatic system. So the implication here is that we have enough energy in our

brain to do one of two things. We can either be awake and doing and taking action, or we

can switch to the sleep mode where our energy then is devoted to opening up these lymphatic

channels and removing debris from the brain. And that debris is basically the byproducts

of oxidative metabolism. So oxidative metabolism, if you think of an internal combustion engine

in car, it consumes oxygen and fuel and combines them to generate energy and a waste product.

So our mitochondria inside of our cells in the brain, the rest of the body, but especially

in the brain, do the same thing. They combine oxygen with the fuel source, which in this

case usually is glucose, and the combustion yields energy in the form of ATP and NAD.

And then there's this byproduct of oxidative metabolism that builds up, and that's free

radicals and beta-amyloid and top protein and other things that accumulate in the brain.

And we can tolerate that to a certain point before we get exhausted and fatigued, or our

cognitive performance declines, and we go to sleep, and we remove all of that junk from

the brain during sleep. So when you're talking about depression and metabolic function, you're

definitely on the right track there. Probably four-fifths of the time people who we see in

the clinical environment who are suffering from depression do so because they simply

just don't have the right metabolic setup to support adequate metabolic function in

the brain. So D. ribose is a really nice way of helping to supply more energy to the brain.

So it's methylcobalamin, which is a hormone B12, and methylfolate, and literally we could

talk all day about all of the different components, the tyrosine, the tionine, and the serine

that go into the formation of neurotransmitters. And then when you think about the metabolic

stresses that occur during increased allosteric load, then the demands on neurotransmitter

formation go up, and we also generate more oxidative metabolic byproducts, and so we

need to clear that out in pieces. So I mean, my thought is, is that the TMS clinics and

the TDCS therapies that are being proposed, there ought to be a conversation, like a global

conversation with these folks, just to bring up what you just said, basically, that some

patients, if they're having a metabolic issue because of their depression, adding a bunch

more stimulation, which makes their brain work a lot harder on paper that doesn't make

a lot of sense to me. Sure. Well, you're right. Just like if your

car, if the oil in the crankcase were almost out, and then you go and try to race your

car on the expressway, you're going to just burn out your engine faster. It's the same

kind of thing in the brain, if you don't have the right kind of substrate for neuronal function,

and then you apply an external energy source, you can just speed up that process of neuronal

damage. So yeah, you're on the right track. Very cool. So this conversation is kind of

popcorn style, and it's that happy hour part of it. So I'll let anyone share what they're

thinking. And if you're in the audience, I mean, I don't like to say audience, but like

anyone who wants to say anything, just raise your hand and I'll bring you up.

Hi, Michael. It's surprising that to learn that what you just mentioned, the glymphatic

system, the functions, I remember reading it maybe last year or a couple of years. But

it seems very logical to me that at night, while sleeping, there's this fluid circulation

of taking away the waste. So I'm curious why do you think at such a late stage, there's

a discovery like this important that just, you know, is agreed upon or is just like a

new, they are assisted by some new device or tools? That's one question.

Yeah, sure. It really comes down to a couple of things. I mean, I think the quality of

thinking and the quality of tools available to us. So, you know, our brains have these

large chambers inside of them called ventricles, which are full of cerebral spinal fluid. And

the ventricles are where the cerebral spinal fluid is actually made for the most part.

And we know that there's a circulatory pathway for that cerebral spinal fluid. What was not

clear entirely is what is happening within the brain parenchym or the tissue itself.

I think it's taken a while for us to even recognize that we needed more than just the

venous drainage system to remove these waste byproducts. Because it was pretty easy to

conclude that, okay, well, you know, arterial blood brings the nutrients into the brain

and then the venous blood removes the waste byproducts. And when anatomists and pathologists

would take pieces of brain tissue and look at it under the microscope, they would not

see lymphatic channels like you would if you were to take a piece of muscle tissue. But

the reason for that is that brain tissue is a very delicate gelatinous tissue. It has

unique properties compared to any other tissue in the body. So it's very easy to destroy

brain tissue, even under the best of circumstances. So when we take these preparations of brain

tissue and look at them under the microscope, what we didn't realize was happening is that

these lymphatic channels, they were so delicate and they were running right, they run right

alongside the veins that are growing in the brain. So it's very easy to miss them. And

they're really, technically, they're potential spaces. They don't open up until enough pressure

develops inside of them to pop them open. So you could never really image those lymphatic

channels in real time in somebody who's going through an autopsy or a pathological specimen.

And it wasn't until MRI technology had advanced to the point where we could actually look

at the bulk flow of water molecules through the brain in real time that we can actually

see those channels open up and witness the flow of watery substance like cirrhospinal

fluid through those channels. So it requires some technological advances. And but really

since 2014, since this was discovered, it's really causes to go back to the drawing board

and rethink everything. You know, if you think about Alzheimer's disease, for example, you

know, we've thought that Alzheimer's disease is a disorder of the accumulation of something

called beta amyloid in the neurons. It's much more than that. It's also insulin resistance

in the neurons. It's vascular damage. It's genetic influences. It's, you know, many things.

But the central dogma has told us that beta amyloid accumulation in the neurons is toxic

to the neurons. And so we embarked on clinical research to try to inoculate the brain against

beta amyloid to essentially vaccinate it. And none of those clinical trials really

panned out. We were scratching our heads. And so when when the lymphatic system was

discovered, it set off this collective light bulb for all of us and oh, okay, so maybe Alzheimer's

disease is a disorder of sleep. People are not getting enough sleep, you know, melatonin

production drops off around the age of 65. So our sleep cycles start to get disrupted

as we get older. And maybe people are just not getting enough sleep to clear out the

beta amyloid from the brain. Same thing for Parkinson's disease. You know, we know that

Parkinson's is many different things. It's famished or dopaminergic neurons. It's chronic

inflammation, chronic loss of neurons. But also it's a failure to clear out tau protein

from the neurons. So all of the neurodegenerative diseases, the inflammatory disorders like

multiple sclerosis seem like they may have in common this problem with insufficient clearance

of toxic metabolites from the brain tissue. So I want to bring up another thing about

basically an Alzheimer's study that came out that basically they said that what's common

in Alzheimer's patients is the like a reduction in new protein synthesis, like in a large

scale impairment of new protein synthesis, which is which is an essential part of long

term potentiation. And so they they gave the animals in the study some some sort of drug

that increased, I wish I had it in front of me, but they gave them a drug that increased

the near the new protein synthesis and they saw some immediate immediate improvements

to the memory that the animals had. And so in the context of that, do you know if new

protein synthesis is also a factor? And as you said Alzheimer's the other one was what's

the other major Parkinson's Parkinson's? Yeah, is that also a factor in Parkinson's?

I'm not sure about the Parkinson's side of things. Honestly, I haven't seen literature

about that in the Alzheimer's side. What we're what we're referring to is a failure of synthesis

of ribosomes. And ribosomes assemble inside the cell on something called the endoplasmic

reticulum. And that's where messenger RNA that's coming from the nucleus gets transcribed

into proteins. So the ribosome is really important for decoding genetic information and practically

turning it into proteins that are used by the cells. So yeah, it's a really interesting

area of investigation for Alzheimer's and probably also for weight loss. You know you

deserve a lot of kudos, Micah. It's been neat to watch your personal weight loss journey.

I wonder if any of this resonates with you. The endoplasmic reticulum in the hypothalamus

and specifically in certain neurons that regulate our sense of hunger or satiety. Those neurons

are very, very easily damaged by the byproducts of oxidative metabolism. And we essentially

can experience what we call endoplasmic reticulum fatigue or failure. And in that case, what's

happening is that those neurons are being overdriven by high levels of ghrelin in the

bloodstream. Ghrelin is the off switch for our appetite. But you know when we eat a traditional

Western diet that's full of all sorts of sugar, you know, and mostly sugar really kind of

overstimulates those ghrelin receptors on the hypothalamic neurons, then the endoplasmic

reticulum can get burned out and the ribosomes essentially get damaged. And so those neurons

need a period to recover, which is why we think fasting can be so useful to help with

neuronal recovery.

So you just said that basically that sugar is damaging the ribosomes that are essential

for new protein synthesis, which is leading to the issues with some of the memory issues

with Alzheimer's, something like that.

Yeah, sugar is probably one of the most toxic substances known to man. It probably doesn't

get enough credit for being that way, but it's just as bad as crack cocaine for the

brain.

So sugar could be one of the major causes of Alzheimer's in theory, I guess.

I think it probably is a big contributor. If you think about, you know, there's some

good evidence that would suggest that people who have Alzheimer's disease basically have

type three diabetes of the brain.

So there's a failure to be able to metabolize glucose properly. And in these neurons that

are burning out, they do not any longer respond well to glucose and glucose is a primary energy

source for neurons.

So for that reason, we've actually started migrating towards a ketotic diet for people

with Alzheimer's and cognitive decline. So you can supplement ketones in the diet, and

that's been shown to be beneficial for people with memory loss. Or you can just cut out

the sugar and let the brain work the way it's supposed to work.

I mean, these are like, these are, you know, national issues and global issues. This is

like, if we, if we can just really point to the financial costs that a country has to pay

in health care because of sugar and, and, you know, let me just pause.

So you're inviting me to get on the soapbox here, Micah. There's financial incentives

in health care and sick care are really misaligned with having a healthy population in my opinion.

So, and when you combine that with the financial incentives in the food production and distribution

system that we have, it's really a recipe for disaster. So it shouldn't be any surprise

to us that we, we haven't, you know, a pandemic of a tsunami of neurological diseases that's

washing over our world right now.

Sean, can I, I was kind of learning a lot about the lymphatic system. I remember a couple

of years ago doing like a report where I had to bring that in a lot. And it sounds like

you know a lot about it. So a couple of questions came to mind and that you tell me if you know,

if you know this off the top of your head. But one thing you talked about was energy.

And so kind of in the big picture, where does that come from? In the sense of, you mentioned

a lymphatic system when you sleep, there's a point at which it builds up pressure so

that the fluids can kind of move across the extracellular space, the parenchyma. And,

and then there's room made kind of surrounding the, the vasculature, I believe. And then

so I guess my questions were, is that the exit or the entrance would be the surrounding

area of the vasculature? And then what is responsible for building up the pressure?

And then what is the energy source of that? If you know any of those, let me know.

I'll do the best I can. I mean, there's great questions. I might guide you. I'm just pulling

up one of my resources in PubMed. There was a really interesting paper published in

2015 in the Journal of Neurochemical, I'm not sure what the journal is here, but the

title is the Ecolymphatic System of Beginner's Guide. So it gives a kind of lays down the

basic principles here. But in a nutshell, energy production in any cell, but definitely

in the brain is sustained by the mitochondria. And the mitochondria are specific specialized

organelles or tiny organs inside of the cells in the brain. And there are different kinds

of cells in the brain. There are neurons and there are glial cells, which are supporting

cells that do not specialize in the transmission of electrical signals, but they support the

cells that do transmit electrical signals. And so those glial cells could be oligodendrocytes

or astrocytes. There are a number of different kinds of cells and they have different functions.

Oligodendrocytes create myelin that insulates the electrical conduction of neurons. Astrocytes

have an inflammatory role and they modulate the fluid that bathes the brain. So when the

mitochondria are generating energy, they do it by combining oxygen with glucose and through

the CREPS cycle, create ATP and NAD. So these are the two primary forms of energy that our

body uses. And so ATP stands for adenosine triphosphate. NADs, nicotine amide, can have

an anti-nucleotide. And they both have phosphates that are attached. So the phosphates are essentially

the form of the currency that are shoveled around the body and used for energy to create

new proteins or to generate function at a cellular and organic or organ system level.

So when it comes to the glymphatic system, the glymphatic tubes run right alongside the

venals, which are these very tiny little veins. So if you think about the order of things,

arteries lead to arterioles. And arterioles then divide to become capillaries. And then

when capillaries come back together, they form venals. Then the venals coalesce into

small veins and the larger veins that drain the brain. So the glymphatic system runs right

along the outside of the capillaries. And essentially, they're a virtual space that

are created by what we call podocytes, or these are essentially the foot processes of the

supporting glial cells. So you'd have to imagine the glial cells have these small projections

that essentially come and wrap around the capillaries and the venals and act as though

they're an external insulating membrane that is creating a potential space around the capillary.

Now, as enough metabolic activity takes place inside the mitochondria and we're generating

waste product, part of that involves water. And water is very abundant throughout the

brains, makes up most of our brain actually. And so that water dissolves different solutes

and ions in it and can traffic different proteins like albumin, for example. And so as that material

builds up inside the neurons, the neurons know to spit that junk outside of the neurons into this

what we call the interstitial space or the space between neurons as it builds up in the

interstitial space that eventually migrates out into these glymphatic channels. But for the most

part, the fluid has a lot of capacity to build up before it starts to really drain. When we

are devoting most of our metabolic activity to thinking and to executing actions during the day,

our neurons are taking up most of that energy and can actually swell to a certain degree. And the

space between the neurons can also swell below that interstitial fluid that's building up these

byproducts of oxidative metabolism. And it turns out that when we go to sleep at night time, this

is when now the glial cells can start their pumping action to create a gradient of flow

to remove this fluid. And probably some of it involves the movement of cilia. These are small

tiny flagellate or like little arms on the surface of the cell that cause fluid to move in a certain

direction. Now that's a very energy intensive activity to have ciliary movement. Can I?

Yeah, go ahead. So I have some confusion over neuroanatomy that I would really love to ask about.

So I've often heard that we have gray matter and we have white matter. And the

explanation is that the gray matter is on the outside of the surface and then the white matter

is the axon fibers that track long distance. So the axon might be the body of a neuron, I guess.

And it might go from the gray matter in your brain all the way down to your toes in one

possible instance. But then if you say, well, what are glial cells? And people say, well,

well, so glial cells or glia are, and it says like, because you've likely heard of gray matter in

the brain, which is made up of cells named called neurons, but a lesser known type of brain cells

is what makes up white matter. And so now that they're like, and they're like saying, okay, no,

glial cells are the white matter. And I'm like, what? Wait, what? Like, wait, is it, is the white

matter the axon or is the white matter glial cells? So could you clarify that? Yeah, I can take this

on. So, so there's like four types of glial cells. And so there's like astrocytes, oligodendrocytes,

microglia, I'm forgetting one, I think. But at least in the central nervous system,

that what makes up the glia is the oligodendrocytes. So one of those types of what makes up the myelin

is those oligodendrocytes, one of those types of glia. So myelin is the in sheet is responsible

for the in sheet thing of the axon. So if you think about like a regenerative signal, so myelin

allows sort of the action potential, you know, this is all within like one, one or two milliseconds

or so, that this sort of action potential conduction velocity is increased in most cases

by by having that myelin around it. So to answer your question, the white matter is axons

in sheathed by oligodendrocytes in the brain. And then outside of the brain, it's Schwann cells,

but they're they're basically doing the same thing. There's some differences.

Okay, so does that mean that a glial cell gets it from so someone might hear that and they might

think well, the glial cell is the is the myelin, but but it's not right? No, no, it is. It is.

So it is one type of glial cell. But let's just restrict this to the in the brain. One type of

glial cell, the oligodendrocyte is literally in sheathing the axons. So so that's the white

matter. So if you're looking at a white matter tract, you're looking at axons in sheathed by

glial cells, and it it's, I guess, whiter, because there's the glial cells wrapping itself around

the axon making it more insulated. Okay, okay, because I thought so I so does that mean that

that like how large is the glial cell? And basically, like, are we talking about like,

like, thousands of wheel cells on a single axon or or what?

Yeah, so in the brain, and jumping and cracking if I'm wrong, but pretty sure in the brain,

you have. So if you take a look at one oligodendrocyte, you'll see it kind of stretch out multiple

arms and in sheath axons from different neurons. However, you're going to also have, if you follow

one axon, multiple oligodendrocytes in sheathing different parts of that axon. So it's very much

like every everybody's touching everybody else kind of thing based on its space that's going through.

Okay, okay, so yeah, so I mean, I guess I had the naive idea that that myelin was sort of like a

laxie substance. I didn't realize it was actually the oligodendrocyte. Yeah, it is the oligodendrocyte,

but it's not like totally crazy to think of it as a laxie substance. It's not a laxie substance,

but the part that's doing the in sheathing, it is a part of the oligodendrocyte is doing the

in sheathing. And the reason it's so good at insulating the axon is because the outside of

the cell is a lipid membrane. So that lipid membrane is going to help insulate it in a way,

you know, like, like, like sort of waxy in a way, because it's non conduct lipids are non-conductive.

So it's it's kind of creating sort of, I guess, more less leak or more resistance on that outside

part of the cell. Super cool. Thank you. Oh, hi, Sean. I was just following up with the

glimpses on the Google. I remember I read that this article, I mean, it's basically my book

mark list by this doctor at Washington University, Franklin Faust. And so the title of the paper is

the cleansing power of a deep night's sleep. And it just to address one of my popular, like,

practical question that with the frequency of the waves, it just seems to me it confirms that

this function, the cleansing function of this circulation of food is only for the deep sleep,

right? So it's the bait that the, what do you call it, baby? What's the slowest is the delta,

delta wave. And so there's this on and off, like, like per second frequency. Is that,

is that correct? Can you come from that? Yeah, sure. So yeah, delta wave is generally the slowest

waveform. So you see, you know, one to three hertz cycles. Yeah. So essentially says that

REM sleep is not bidding off for cleansing our brain. Is that resetting the sleep?

You know, actually REM sleep is no different from being awake, except that you're just asleep.

It's a very REM sleep is a very metabolically active time and uses a lot of energy in your

cognitive circuits. So it probably contributes to more accumulation of the five products of

oxidative metabolism. When you go, when you fall back out of REM sleep into stage three,

and then stage, really stage four of sleep, of slow wave sleep is when the delta activity kicks in,

and that's a very slow pattern of sleep. And that's when the lymphatic system really optimally

does its job. I see. I think it's interesting that you also, of course, you mentioned the

melatonin, right? So there's a, for me, I mean, for a person that in mid 40s that is still not,

you mentioned the age of 65, when this melatonin function will decrease. However,

recently, is it because of the last pattern for, you know, work out from home that I start to

notice? I mean, I'm very sensitive to, I mean, decision in keeping the time of one of my sleep

patterns, right? It never happened to me that, which happened to me in the last almost four months

now, every day. I mean, I didn't notice any, you know, stress, like, just like, even, you know,

because I'm reviewing my old, like, it's still like, you know, I only get like, very sharply,

I would wake up, no matter when I go into sleep, I'll wake up like four hours, like, it's like

clockwork. I don't know what happens. And then, usually, if I woke up due to some noises at night,

you know, the draws in is, or could be back to sleep right away. But now it's very strange.

Well, but you're not alone, Frank. You know, I'm seeing this in my clinic. I think the fact that

we're, you know, in one year, we had a pandemic, global economic meltdown, and the craziest elections

in history of anybody who's alive. You know, the stress levels are extremely high for everybody,

even people who are not necessarily consciously aware of their stress levels. So that's,

that's one thing to consider. But then, you know, there are other physiological things that are

happening. You know, everybody should consider, anybody who's having difficulty sleeping ought

to consider the possibility that they may be dealing with sleep apnea. And this is

so common for me to see in clinic, and it's so common for people to deny that they could possibly

be suffering from sleep apnea. It's a really interesting disconnect. But apnea is a condition

that causes people to lose the ability to breathe properly during sleep. And, you know, if you're,

if you're working a sedentary job, and you're not getting your 10,000 steps in walking a day,

and you're not exercising properly, probably your palate is getting a little bit soft and

blocking off your airway. You know, folks sitting around working on computers all day,

the muscle tone gets a little bit weak. And then when you go to bed at night time, you

lay flat on your back, suddenly the airways getting blocked off. And so this main manifest is

snoring. The main manifest is having heartburn at night time or being restless in bed. It can

manifest as just waking up in the morning feeling very fatigued and washed out. It can manifest

as having these irregular middle of the night wakings that sometimes are accompanied by a sense

of panic or heart racing, but not necessarily. I mean, just wake up and can't get back to sleep.

And all of that is because your brain is trying to protect you from dying in your sleep from a

lack of oxygen because you're not breathing properly. So I can use a, I just saw a patient

this week, I can use as an example, a 67-year-old man who is developing mild cognitive impairment.

He is getting a large belly. He's not exercised. He's eating a lot of sugar. His inflammatory

markers are very high. And he's just washed out in fatigue. And we did a polysomnogram,

which is a fancy way of saying sleep studying. And we found that at most he was sleeping four

hours per night. It was very broken sleep. And he was not going into the deep stages of sleep,

the slow wave sleep at all. He would get a little bit of REM sleep, but it wasn't much either.

And so here he was thinking, he was spending eight hours in bed sleeping when in reality

he was getting probably around four hours of sleep. And he was getting no time at all in that

restful recuperative stage of sleep when the glymphotic system would want to turn on and clear

out the debris from the brain. So when we tracked this back about three years ago is when he started

getting more fatigued and tired. So he was just about turning 65. And I see this probably four

or five times a week in my clinic, people who had the exact same story. And basically what's going

on is that the pineal gland is burning out and it's just not producing melatonin the way it ought

to. And so it sets off this cascade of altered sleep cycles. And then when people get tired,

they don't work out. They don't stay on top of their nutrients the way that they ought to. And

it's a vicious cycle. Stop will lead to premature strokes, heart attacks, Alzheimer's disease,

at that for a young age. So and when I say 60s is young, that's because I take care of patients

all the way up to their hundreds commonly. So I hope that gives you a perspective there.

All right, thanks. I mean, by the way, I mean, I don't think I have that because I keep up with

the regular like actually quite intense like swimming, like in a competitive style. So twice a

week, I don't think I have that. But I'll look at it definitely. That's very good point. Especially

melatonin, I think there's probably some kind of what is the clock rhythm thing that I would

eating or diet or looking to that. And you may want to also contemplate the idea that your

serotonin levels might be low. The serotonin is very important for initiation and maintenance of

sleep. And with increased levels of stress, and that could be physiological stress also. So if

you're inactive swimmer, I see this with my professional athletes that I take care of that

oftentimes they'll be pushing themselves hard, and then they will not be producing a serotonin to

keep up with the demands. And that can also degrade the sleep cycles. So an easy easy fix there would

be to increase the amount of serotonin producing substances in your diet. And my favorite go to

is called Sam E, which stands for acid emissile methionine. It's a great natural supplement

that helps to improve your serotonin production. Super. Yeah, thanks. Sure.

I will say that I while you all were talking, I looked up Parkinson's disease, see if new protein

synthesis is suppressed. And in fact, that is what the recent research is of 2020 is saying in

several different articles, which is really fascinating, because I just guessed. And it's

actually the fact. And then they're also connected. So there's a paper, I guess, I should say it's

a reference, the references paper, there's a bunch of articles, if you just look for the topic,

but the paper is that it's called ribosomal protein, S15, phosphorylation mediates LRRK to

neuro degeneration in Parkinson's disease. And yeah, that's really interesting that basically,

you know, so there we have the ribosome mentioned again, right? And new protein synthesis inhibited

now in both Parkinson's disease and an Alzheimer's disease, we're we're solving.

I'm just kidding. It's very interesting that sugar, sugar might be the factor in both diseases.

So Michael, that's a good point. The large Q protein, which involves, I think, the L stage

releasing is very important for production of energy in the cell. And if you think about

I don't know if you've touched on this in the other conversations, but, but autophagy is the

mechanism by which cells digest themselves and recycle their material. So the nitrogen, carbon,

et cetera, all the different constituent elements that make up cells, when a cell dies and goes

through what's called apoptosis, it gets recycled through this process of autophagy or autophagy.

And the large two protein plays a very important role in that autophagy. And when that gene gets

mutated, it can really cause problems or cells for the normal protein synthesis. Fasting,

by the way, is a great way to induce autophagy. And it creates a, you know, by creating a caloric

stress and fasting beyond 16 hours, it turns on a really beneficial chain reaction of

clearance of cells that are functioning or pre-cancerous or even cancerous cells. So

I think that we're probably seeing down the road that data comes out that tells us that fasting

is not only good for, you know, cardiovascular disease and stroke, but also good for Parkinson's

and Alzheimer's disease mitigation or what a sort. But again, it comes down to this large two

protein synthesis. So yeah, good, good find there. I'm really, so I have a hypothesis

that I want to throw at the group and anyone could try to chime in, but what it is. So,

so you know, we saw, so basically, yeah, the question is, why does, why does inflammation

results in so many different kinds of symptoms? It's almost like people have said that inflammation

is as a mother of disease in terms of like, it can, it's there before, you know, so many other

possible diseases happen. It's like a precursor to so many different branches of disease. And I mean,

I guess, I guess the biggest example of the past year was, was perhaps was COVID-19 in terms of,

you know, COVID-19 inflammation playing a big role in that. And I can describe it. I posted an

article about it, but basically, the way sort of the sort of the route is that COVID-19 is virus

that needs to self-replicate to perpetuate its existence. So it has to attach other cells and

it attaches with the, with a couple of receptors. One of them is the ACE2. Another one was the

CD147 spike protein. But the ACE2 is the big one. So the ACE2 was, it's an enzyme that's attached

to the outer surface of cell membranes and the lungs and the heart and the arteries and the heart,

the kidney, the intestines, all throughout the vascular system. There's ACE2 receptors in

the endothelial lining of cells, like basically, you know, everywhere in your blood vessels

and your cells. And so there's like ample ways for this virus to find targets to replicate

itself. And so the endothelial lining of cells is a particular, particularly big target,

both in blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. And what happens is the ACE2 receptors, because,

because the virus uses them to insert itself into the cell, the ACE2 receptors get degraded.

And that, that basically throws a wrench in the angiotensin system because you need to have,

because you ever, your ACE1 receptors are causing vasoconstriction and your ACE2 receptors are

causing vasodilate dilation. And you have to have a balance between the two. That's the angiotensin

system. If there's too many ACE1 or too many ACE2, you're going to have too much constriction

or too much vasodilation. And, and so this, so this, you know, I guess the way I,

I understand it is that, you know, when, when, when the, when the degradation of the endothelial

lining is not just a matter of reducing the ACE2 receptors. So, so now that the blood vessels

want to constrict, right? But it's also a matter of degrading the actual tissue. So, so, so then,

you know, in, you know, I guess fluid can leak through, like in the case of, you know, what

happens in the lungs, I guess that's part of what's happening is, is, you know, the,

the, the, maybe the cell walls are breaking and fluids is filling up the lungs and something like

that. But, but part of it is like, you know, the, the, the process of oxidative stress,

the part of the process of free radicals, you know, attacking your body and destroying your body,

just like, I, like I am picturing and maybe this is wrong, but that, that it's kind of like free

radicals or like little chainsaws, you know, like, and they're just like shredding your, your, your

tissue, right? And so you need to combat them with, with, with antioxidants. And, and this could

be wrong. So, like, I'm definitely like saying this out loud, these, these things that I think

that might be wrong. So they, so go folks can respond to me and tell me what, where I need

to correct my thinking on this. And then, so we have oxidative stress happening, which is basically

like a, like free radicals. But, but in this case, it's the, it's the degradation of the ACE2 receptors

and the degradation of the endothelial lining via that process. And, and so, and so, so maybe, so a

possible thing, you know, is, I've, in my article, I said, well, maybe D-ribbles could be a way to,

to deal with, with oxidative stress, but, but I mean, maybe not. And someone else later on,

this doctor was, came up with the idea of using NAC. He's this guy, this guy on YouTube, he said

NAC is N-acetylcystine, because it's, it's, it has, it's basically, it releases, it helps your body

to create glutathione, which is a very powerful antioxidant. And so that's much better at dealing

with oxidative stress. But, but going back to basically like, yeah, so oxidative stress is

perhaps like a precursor to when we're getting to, to inflammation. And, and in, in addition to,

like, you know, when you're, when you're shredding the cells, you're also releasing things that are

supposed to not be released, like, like von Willebrand's factor and other thrombosis factors, and that,

that those can lead to blood clots. So we have blood, we have blood vessel constriction and we

have blood clots. And so then, you know, the media were like, well, why is this, like, we thought

this was something that was just causing it, like, people couldn't breathe. And we don't understand

why, why people are getting heart attacks and strokes. And, and so now, yeah, if this thing is

like infecting the lymphatic system, and it's infect, infecting the blood vessels, and this is

like all old news now, right? But, well, then, then, but why, why, why, why is it, and then here,

and then here, we have basically the story of inflammation. Again, it's like, why are there

so many different patient reactions to this? And I think it goes back to, like, why are there so

many different patient reactions to inflammation? Like, why, like, why is it that, that, you know,

you know, I guess depression could be caused by a metabolic disorder, but, but, but sometimes,

you know, the stimulant, giving the brain a lot of stimulation helps a lot. And so that's,

so that means that there's another way that depression can be caused. You know, so maybe

it's like, they have too much trauma, but they have plenty of, they have good metabolism. And

then, so they're producing too much inflammation. And so, like, here, so getting really to the

heart of my question, I'd love for you to correct all everything that I said that was wrong, but

the heart of my question is like, and the heart of the hypothesis is like, I think that, you know,

that the reason inflammation is causing different kinds of diseases in, in different people has

to do with where the inflammation is the greatest. Like, if it's, if the inflammation is happening

in the lungs the greatest, then the chances of RDS would be greatest for that, for that patient.

If the inflammation is happening, you know, in, in, you know, maybe near the brainstem, I'm not

exactly sure where, maybe the, the chance of depression is the greatest. If it's happening

in the vascular system, the chance of a heart attack is the greatest, especially the heart,

if it's happening. So, I'll stop there. Like, I know, threw up a lot of really interesting ideas

there and a lot of food for thought. I think that you're on the right track with everything. I would

like to invite everybody here to join us next Monday at the NeuroNation Club.

We're going to be talking about coronavirus and brain. And I think that, you know, what you touched

on with the anesthetial system was really compelling. This has been something that I've prescribed for

years for my patients because it's such an effective antioxidant. And there's really good

evidence that anesthetial system, or NAC as we sometimes call it, actually helps to improve

frontal lobe function, especially in people who are dealing with neurodegenerative disorders

or obsessive compulsive disorder and other similar kinds of problems. So, really interesting,

idea. I tend to prefer a natural supplement called protandem, which actually causes your cells to

generate its own glutathione, at a greater rate than normal. So, it's really a novel and interesting

approach to get your cells to behave in a more protected fashion. But I think what really is

fascinating about coronavirus is it's taught us so much and you're definitely on the right track

in terms of the idea of inflammation being a highly conserved and broad spectrum pathological state,

is that when it comes to coronavirus, one of the things that I've been seeing at least clinically,

and I think a lot of other neurologists are seeing, is that it really is a brain disorder,

almost more than anything else. And you could just kind of scoff and say, I'm biased,

being a brain doctor, but the truth is, is that when you get down to it, so much of what we're

seeing happening in the body, in the lungs, in the heart, in the peripheral vasco system relates

back to dysregulation at the level of the brain. So, the autonomic nervous system,

which comprises the parasympathetic nervous system, are the parts of the nervous system that govern

how much adrenaline is being dumped into the bloodstream, how much cortisol is being poured

into the bloodstream. It governs your heart rate, your blood pressure, your breathing rate.

And so what we're seeing when people get infected with coronavirus, and it works through

its different stages, that eventually people develop this uncoupling or this dysregulation

of the sympathetic nervous system, and you get this massive outflow of adrenaline, which then

leads to increased shearing forces on the lining of the blood vessels, and unnecessary damage

and disruption of the endothelium. So not only do you have a direct viral effect on the endothelium,

but now you have the secondary degradation of endothelial integrity, which then really leads

to a lot of capillary permeability and flooding the lungs, flooding the heart tissue with fluid

that is hard to get rid of. There's really some interesting data that has come out recently

that's showing us that when somebody develops coronavirus and it invades the brain through

the olfactory nerves in the front of the brain, right, you have these two nerves that

dangle down at the base of the brain right under the frontal lobes called the olfactory nerves,

and when people lose their sense of smell, it's because the virus has essentially

infected that nerve tissue, and it's crawling back through those nerves and making them dysfunctional,

but where do those viruses end up? They crawl right up into the basal forebrain and into the

frontal lobes, and they spread across the base of the frontal lobes, into the temporal lobes,

and then the brain stem and the cerebellum. So if we do any of these nuclear imaging studies,

like a PET scan or a SPECT scan or a functional MRI, we can actually see that in a lot of people

with coronavirus, even people with low-grade supposedly asymptomatic cases, that the parts

of the brain that control anxiety and memory and that control our behavior patterns are essentially

being turned off because of this inflammation that's occurring in the basal forebrain and the

temporal lobes. And so what I'm seeing now down the road, people have been affected three, six,

nine, 12 months ago, is they're developing these cognitive disorders, fibromyalgia type pictures,

even what looks like early onset Alzheimer's disease in some folks. So you're really kind

of keying on a really important thing here, which is that the dysfunction that we're seeing,

which is so broad-spread, has a lot to do with induction of the inflammatory system and an

overexpression of inflammatory mediators that are then causing secondary damage to the endothelium,

but also to the nervous system itself. So I agree, and that's till 60 is important, but

check out vitamin D. I think you'll find that probably as much as we're dealing with a viral

pandemic, we're also dealing with a pandemic of deficiency of vitamin D. Vitamin D is a very

important neuro hormone that controls a thousand genes in our body. And when we're deficient in

vitamin D, it allows an overexpression of inflammation. And so nowadays when somebody gets

really sick with coronavirus, we're actually loading them up with vitamin D to try to get control

over that inflammatory system. So what about this pro-tandem, P-R-O-T-A-N-D-I-M?

Yeah, it's really, to me, this is such a fascinating product because I think it signals

the beginning of the legitimization of nutrients as medication, which is a little sad because if

you go back to the roots of medicine and Hippocrates, he taught us that we should let our food be our

medicine and our medicine be our food. But modern healthcare really kind of doesn't make it easy

for doctors to be big advocates for proper nutrition. So that has fallen by the wayside, but

researchers around 1998-99 who were very interested in this idea of oxidizing metabolism

discovered that they could use a blend of a number of different natural, you know,

ingredient turmeric and I don't know what they are, a handful of other spices essentially

that when you combine them in the right proportion would actually significantly decrease

the biomarkers for oxidative stress in the body. And so it turns out that what they were

modulating was an important gene region called the nuclear factor Kappa, which is a highly

conserved segment of DNA that regulates inflammation. So when you modulate this with what's called

NRF1 or NRF2, specifically NRF2, it modulates this region that's, if you don't suppress it,

creates widespread inflammation. When you do suppress it, it normalizes inflammation. And so

this pro-tandem product kind of did two things. Number one, it suppressed this inflammatory region.

Number two, it induces the natural production of glutathione at a much higher rate than

normal, so it gives you an antioxidant effect as well. And what really caught my eye and keep

in mind, I'm an allopathic physician. I prescribe medications. I believe medications can be very

helpful for people if they're used wisely. But when they showed me the data that this

natural supplement was actually more effective at reducing inflammation than a medication that had

just been cleared by the FDA for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, that really caught my eye.

And I thought this is really fascinating. So a lot of doctors have started to use that particular

product to help normalize inflammation in people who have conditions, you know, different medical

conditions. And, you know, it's not FDA approved to treat anything. But if you think about how

you know our bodies function, there's two versions of us, right? There's the

salad and water version of us, and then there's the Krispy Kreme Dunkin Donuts soda version of us.

And what you put into your body does have a big impact on how it functions. So I think

this is such an exciting product. And it's kind of paved the way for a lot of other what we call

nutraceuticals, which are pharmacological grade nutrients that actually do have a predictable

effect in modulating the human body. I kind of have like a general question about the current

state of medical practice. So I would think of vitamin D. If doctors are prescribing that to

your COVID patients, my guess is that vitamin D addresses inflammation foremost. Does it also

address oxidative stress? And, okay, and then I guess I was going to say the side question is

are doctors actually also, along with vitamin D, actually mentioning protandem to patients or not?

To COVID patients? I mean, like broadly.

You know, I'm not aware of anybody that would recommend protandem or any other nutrient as a

treatment for coronavirus, just because we really don't have the evidence that would say that

anything like that is effective, you know. So it's one thing to prescribe something as a treatment

with the understanding that it's going to create a cure. It's another thing to recommend a lifestyle

change that will create favorable conditions for better health. So I think it's important to make

that distinction because what we don't want to do is engage in quackery and, you know, start to get

off into the weeds. But, you know, if somebody asks me, well, would you recommend that a person

10 feet underwater be given oxygen? I would say, well, of course, you know, if you deprive that

person of oxygen, they're not going to last more than a minute, right? Same kind of thing here.

If somebody is sick with a viral illness, I'm going to want them the best possible setup

for success to fight it. And so a big part of that includes making sure that they have the

proper nutrients on board to create all of the different proteins and substances that they

need to fight off the infection. So my question then would be like, so is the current medical

profession is, there's a consensus that inflammation is a major component of treating,

treating inflammation is a major component of treating coronavirus patients, but treating

oxidative stress is not a major component of treating coronavirus patients.

No, I don't know. I kind of disagree. I mean, I do think that treating oxidative stress is

important. It's a balance, right? Because in a way that oxidative stress actually helps to kill the

virus, you know, just like it would help to kill any invasive bacteria that we get in your blood

stream. But too much oxidative stress then can backfire and damage your own cells and lead to

unnecessary tissue pathology. So, you know, it's a balance. But if you think about what's going on

with coronavirus, we know that there's this explosion of inflammatory proteins in the blood

stream and massive oxidative damage downstream from there. So to the extent that we can get that

under control and then the systemic inflammatory response can be modulated in a beneficial way.

So maybe my understanding was incorrect, but I thought that the way the path was actually like

the COVID-19 attacks the AST receptors damages the endothelial lining of cells, which is the

point at which oxidative stress is happening. Then later on down the line, inflammation is

happening. Is that incorrect? No, that's correct. But I mean, inflammation takes place from the

very moment the virus hits the bloodstream. It just, if you think about what happens downstream,

you've got several lines of defense. If the virus gets through the first line of defense

and then the second line has to be invoked, then that leads to a much more dramatic

release of inflammatory mediators, which then can lead to secondary tissue damage. So to the

extent that you can keep it to the first line of defense by making sure that you've got enough

vitamin D on board and that you've got good health and that your own natural inflammatory

system is already under control, then that can prevent the virus from getting through the first

line of defense to the second line of defense, which is where we think that all the damage

really starts to take place. So it sounds like the medical profession at large might agree that

oxidative stress is a major part of the disease process of SARS-CoV-2, but they would not prescribe

something to treat oxidative stress at this point, right? Is that correct? Well, I don't know. I think

it depends on who you're talking to. There are doctors who will. I mean, we give steroids, for

example. Steroids are very powerful at producing inflammation and oxidative stress. So those are

the big guns. So yeah, I think it's fair to say that we are using different things, but it's a

process, right? We still haven't figured out the entire recipe that guarantees good outcome. It's

still under construction. Okay, I have some confusion about basically the process of, so

inflammation is associated with RDS, but so is the degraded endothelial lining. And so I wonder,

which one is the bigger factor to causing RDS? Is it the decimation of the cell line or the

inflammation? Yes, I think the great degree is the disruption of the integrity of the endothelium,

and then that's just made worse by the secondary release of inflammatory mediators

and adrenaline. Adrenaline plays a big role. So there's a neural hormonal dysregulation that

takes place later on in the illness because you're getting this invasive effect in the brain. And so,

you know, where maybe inflammation of the endothelium might have been manageable,

this secondary wave of damage then just is the second punch that puts people over the edge.

Cool, cool. I'll pause for a second if anyone else has questions. And if you're down below,

if you want to speak, just raise your hand.

Hey, Sean, I have a quick question. So you probably at the beginning mentioned that

you are working on some devices. Can you recap what that is and what is really easy related?

Sure, Frank. Yeah, I'm currently not working on any projects. I've launched a number of

and participated in the development of a number of different biomedical products over the years.

I think the one that I'm watching with the most interest is the cerebell,

just because I've been waiting for a long time for a low-cost portable EEG to come out of the

market. I think I'm really interested in that because I feel like I have a certain demographic

that I take care of in my patient. It's that would like that.

Okay. You may have cut out. I'm not necessarily looking for any pathology, but just

cut out. Yeah, just for a minute. I don't know if you want to repeat your last sentence.

Yeah, so some of my patients are interested in using EEG to assess their own cognitive

performance, not looking for any pathology, but just understanding how well their frontal

deloads are functioning at any one time. So I'm excited about that product there.

Hi, Ted Texter. Welcome to the stage. This is a

newer nation and a regular clubhouse event with Dr. Moore and Dr. Micah.

And I noticed that you're a more expert on laughter, I think. So welcome. I'm just asking,

Sam, as a newer surgeon, what is his perspective on technology and consumer devices? He recommended

this Cerebel.com. Is that correct? C-E-R-I-V-E-L-L. Yes, C-E-R-I-V-E-L-L Cerebel.com.

Great, great device. I'm really impressed with the way they put this together.

It's an FDA clearance for looking for patients with nonconvulsive seizures. So it is possible to

have a seizure without having any actual motor manifestations, so we call that nonconvulsive

status epilepticus, which is a real problem because these folks will generally just look

like they're unconscious, maybe that they're sleeping when in reality their brain is cooking

away with a bad seizure. So it's a pretty exciting concept. But I hate to say it, but I'm going to

have to duck out, folks. I'm going to try to turn on my lymphatic system now and clear out some of

the debris that I built up here talking with me and thank people so much for the opportunity.

Yeah, thank you, Sean. It was great. Take care, y'all. Take care.

Wow, that was just great. It's fantastic. Well, we could reset the room. This is the

neurophysics neurogear happy hour, vibrations and auspations. You can bring up any topic as long

as it's in some part so many to this topic. No, but yeah. Welcome, everybody.

Just to say I'm waking up from a nap. I've been working super super hard and I've just

working up for like two hours, but when you ping me into the room, it looks so good I couldn't

refuse. So just that's why I stepped up and I'm not going to say anything for a bit. I have,

yeah, I've lost coffee to make and teeth brush. Yeah, I just have to say that for me,

that conversation with Sean was just incredible. Don't do this to me. Don't ping me into a room

when someone goes, okay, folks, good night. No, I mean, that was really good. I think the

room is going to go for another three hours, maybe, but we'll see. Hopefully. Let me make

Dexter, I'm going to make you and call on making moderators and just so that

perhaps you can invite some folks so we can keep this going.

As you can see, this room is not part of any club. I'm not trying to grow any sort of club,

but my objective here is just to have good conversations. So let me

also ping some folks while I'm at it. I'm going to get the coffee on, but make it,

if you, I'd be really, really grateful if you could, just like, yeah, what glad to hear about

what Sean had to say. Is my mic on yet? Okay, so it was incredible. So Sean is hosting something

on Monday, which is about coronavirus in the brain, because he's a brain doctor.

But we talked all about basically the, well, I, so I wrote about the process of

how the coronavirus affects the human body and why it attacks all over the place.

And he said I was, and I talked about, you know, the role of inflammation,

role of oxidative stress. And he said I was right on with a lot of, with basically everything.

But then I, but then I also had a lot of gaps. So I was like, okay, well, so what's the,

with RDS, what's the bigger deal? Is it inflammation or is it the degradation of the

endothelial lining? And, and so I got an answer. Yeah, it definitely is the bigger of the two

factors is the degradation of the cells. That's what releases the fluid. And that seems obvious,

right? And the inflammation is sort of secondary in terms of like,

hang on, there are going to be a whole bunch of people in the room who have no idea what you're

talking about. But yeah, okay, it seems obvious. Yep. Yeah. And like in retrospect, it seems obvious,

but it's weird. It's like before, before he answered that I was, it wasn't obvious.

Yes. No, no, no, I think you're right. When did you try and counteract this?

I'm sorry. So the original article that I wrote was back in April, which you can

April of last year. Yeah, 2020.

Wow. It's a real coincidence because that's when I was working on COVID-19 stuff.

I basically spent about a month and a half trying to figure it out.

Well, so in my article, I mentioned that we need to treat inflammation and we need to treat

oxidative stress. And so I mentioned, you know, before you go to the doctor, you want to make

sure you're getting your D ribose and your vitamin D, your antioxidants and your zinc.

I also mentioned vitamin C because the body completes a lot of vitamin C fighting a virus.

And then after I wrote the article, I found out that about something called NAC, which is,

which helps increase the glutathione production, which is a powerful antioxidant in the human

body. And then one thing that I got out of this was really valuable was that he mentioned

he mentioned something that's even better than NAC, which is this product called protandem,

which is like a natural, let me write this down. So NAC,

protandem. NAC is called cysteine, right? Yeah, NAC is called cysteine. But in theory,

that increases your glutathione production. And this other thing does it even better.

So I don't know that you need both. Well, there's two different. One increases intracelular,

glutathione. The other is intracellular. And you want to increase glutathione in the cells

because you're trying to combat radical oxygen species.

Oh, damn. Thank you for that nuance. Wow. The knowledge that you contribute, Dexter,

is just a major contribution. Thank you.

Oh, everything is interesting. So yeah, I scratched my head exactly the same way because

the trials, there have been trials now on the efficacy of NAC. And they've been really disappointing.

No one quite understood why, but I figured that would be the case. And so, yeah, I was,

a friend of mine was working on this and I had my answer ready to email her. I was like,

let me know how those trials go. But yeah, it was underwhelming. But yeah, it's really

inside the cell that you need it, of course. So you're aware of NAC trials and you found

that they were underwhelming. People had this hypothesis. They tested it. It didn't work

the way they hoped. Everyone thought this was going to be, of course, the most effective way

of basically eliminating NADP pH and other reactive oxygen species. And the end point

is to increase like superoxide discontase. That's basically your sort of mask. Well,

the crucifying is the final master anti-oxidant. But in the endothelium in regards to cells,

it's the discontase that you want. So that was the theory. Yeah, there's no reason why

it shouldn't have worked. But no one actually looked to see exactly where it was being increased,

right? People just look at serum measures. But yeah, it was underwhelming. Just to say,

it's one study. But in any case, it's found in clinic in general. It's not turned out to be

this sort of, well, no one thinks so. It's a silver bullet. But its efficacy has been generally low.

But yeah, clinically, we now have a pretty good idea as to why.

Okay. So pro-tandem is going to do intracellular. Do you already know that?

Is that what you said? I do not know. Basically, yeah, we were looking at something else,

which does the same thing. But I don't know what to say. So I'll take a look at it. How do you

spell it? P-R-O-T-A-N-D-I-M. Yeah, so I was just looking for trial. I'm looking at trials right

now to see if there's a trial for COVID-19 and pro-tandem. Cool. Yeah. And so your idea of this

was around basically eliminating oxidative stress in the vascular endothelium because you see like

inflammation and oxidative stress as being like hand in hand as the kind of like favorable

relief for the virus to basically replicate and for the viral load to increase kind of

rapidly coming. Is that right? No. So it comes back to like, you know, I was thinking about like,

so there's something that I don't understand, which may have caused me to have this hypothesis.

But I don't understand really the relationship between free radicals and antioxidants.

So I guess one idea that I have is a free radical is like a bunch of chainsaws that are floating

around and destroying cell tissue. And that antioxidants are flying around and capturing

these chainsaws and rendering them neutral or something. And then they get disposed out of

the body. That sounds, that's probably wrong. But what do you think? Well, that's the classic idea.

The classic idea is like, oxidants bad, oxidants get rid of, oxidants side effects. I'm no expert,

right? I just picked this up just because like so many people I just like want to understand.

Yeah, you know, want to understand it and see if just the whatever backgrounds that I had kind of

might might be useful. It's more the case that there's a redox, right? So oxygen is used basically

to yeah, oxygen is essential in any case for metabolic processes. But it's also toxic.

And so there's like a redox converting the products of basically its consumption back into kind of

yeah, basically, you have this thing is basically a redox mechanism, which keeps a balance. What

you don't want is stress, more or less. But I'm no expert, but it's not, it's not like, you know,

oxidization, bad, anti oxidant, panacea, it's more just the balance, which is in the redox

between one and the other. And many things in many metabolic processes work that way, by the way. So

like nitric oxide is the same, especially in the vascular endothelium is that the generation of

nitric oxide enables, it enables vasodilation. It is an anti coagulant, but produced in two

greater quantity, it compromises the vascular barrier. And that's when you get micro pulmonary

leakage and some of the, yeah, fatal like sepsis like downstream effects of COVID-19. But generally,

if sepsis come from basically this dysregulation of nitric oxide, so many things are like that,

but I'm not an expert on antioxidants. Unfortunately, I was scared away by how much

everything was said to be an anti, that there wasn't that antioxidant was said to be wonderful.

And so I was like, I'm not sure. But yeah, it's basically the redox you want to balance.

So we had this. So going back to what the idea was, was that I thought, well, maybe

because so that SARS-CoV-2 was causing the degradation of the endothelial lining and

that was similar to oxidative stress and that free radicals might be damaging nerve tissue

in producing something. You know, I think you're right. For what it's worth, right?

But I'm really interested, like your background is kind of broad, but what caused you to kind of

attend to understand at such a level and very early days, right? There was like very,

very thin information on the ground at that point. Yeah, no, I mean, so like, so for example,

I did a podcast. So I did the Neuralase podcast with a friend of mine who runs ligandal, which is

he basically he created like a peptide that was that was designed to be the first vaccine for

COVID-19. And so he is he's very suspicious about why he was shut down. But but in any case,

like I so like, and then I've also like, so because so because I basically in 2012, because I did

dedicate the focus of the rest of my life to three to solving three things, three technologies,

basically one is nerve gear. And then the other two are artificial brain tissue. And the third one

is artificial brains. And so that is basically what I dedicated my life to. And that's why I

I got into a conversation with this guy from ligandal back in the in 2017 about

what what I was trying to explain some of my ideas of how cognition works. And I tried to

you know, basically, we got into a discussion where we began to talk about the different

networks of communication in the brain. And and and I was most interested in what

and what I learned would be called the ionotropic brain, because he is much more interested in

like the glial signaling. And so that was a big part of our conversation. Anyway, that was all

recorded and so people can listen to that neural age podcast if they want to. And so how did you

yeah, sorry, my question is more, how did you end up learning so much about SARS-CoV-2 and that

yeah, that pathogenesis like, yeah, I'm just curious, because we have so many

products, that's how I think. I mean, I so I I throw my my brain around like a like a hammerhead

shark at every concept that I can find. And so I so I ended up at some point at a using my

press pass as a journalist to get into a conference that was about cancer and immunology

treatments, especially using CAR T cells and and so on. And there was I was just like immediately

overwhelmed in that conference with like, you know, it was stuff that was just like,

way above my head at the time that at the conference, but but I really caught on quick.

And so that like, so when the when COVID-19 happened, and I saw everyone talking, I was like,

oh, I know what this is. And so like, I started diving deep into into everything.

You're really quiet. Oh, sorry. How about that? Way better.

Okay, sorry about that. There's a little bit about the exact kind of infected process and how that

leads to endothelial damage, basically. But I think there's kind of a clearer and clearer picture.

So the first thing about COVID-19 was everyone just assumed that it was a, you know, that it was,

you know, per SARS, that it was a respiratory condition, right? So into the lungs. It's kind of

it's so bad. What I hear in my voice is I hear Trump's voice doing it gets in the lungs. It

does a hell of a number on them. That's not the case, right? So basically, in in in April, March,

April, but really April, the first autopsy started to come out where you had patients with fully

complied lungs, as you say, not much like aviola pulmonary damage, but massive microvascular

damage, masculine systemic damage. So that was the big mystery. This is not like, of course,

you have like lung fibrosis, but it's not like a classic viral influenza. And so

that started me down the path of looking at it from the same perspective as you have done. And

it sounds like, yeah, the guy that you were just interviewing, that basically you're looking at

the damage to the systemic vasculature, but also particularly as concerns the brain,

microvascular damage, and what results from that. And there are lots of theories about

about that. But certainly,

obstructive stress and super oxidation is involved in all of them. The question is, how does that

arise, right? I so I believe I answered that question in an article in basically in 2020.

And so if you look at my most recent Twitter posts, it's to a medium link, you can see that

article right now. So you just click on my profile and click on Twitter and then click on the thing

I just posted, which is a medium article. And I'll write this is about stars.

Cove to and I'll just paste. I'm just going to tweet it again at this time with the title.

And then so like if you look at it, basically, I walk you through it really quick.

It looks like we lost one of our speakers. But so okay, so the so the idea real quick was

the main attack factors. It's basically like the virus needs to self replicate. So it needs to

attach to other cells. And there's two main ways it attaches to other cells. One is to the main

way is the ACE2 receptor and the secondary way is with the CD147 receptor or enzyme. So the

so the ACE2 is actually an enzyme. It's part of the angiotensin system. It's on the outer layer of

cell, cell membranes. It was interesting that you said that there's a of any review there's a

balance between antioxidants and free radicals. There is an entity there's a balance between

ACE2 and ACE1. ACE2 will cause vasodilation. ACE1 will cause vasoconstriction.

I think you mean ang2 and ang1 and angiotensin 1 and angiotensin 2.

That's right. That's right. I mean, I mean, I mean, I guess, I guess I was just, you know,

I guess it's spelled A-C-E2 and that's why I was pronouncing it A-C-E2.

The short version. Yeah, sure. So I understand.

For angiotensin converting enzyme.

Yes, but it's actually what ends up basically in the blood, which is the angiotensin is typically

abbreviated like ang2. Basically, yeah, yeah, yeah, agreed.

And so the endothelial lining is being degraded because that's that's where the virus is

attaching. And the endothelial lining is out through is running. It's running all over your body.

It's running throughout all of your blood vessels, from your head to your toes and your lungs,

your arteries, your heart, kidney, intestines. And that tissue is being destroyed because the

virus is attaching via those receptors and they're being degraded. And that process

is similar to is similar to free radicals, but like an extreme like storm of free radicals.

And so, you know, so if so, if we can call it oxidative stress, and the idea was that well,

maybe one possible treatment for COVID-19 would be to treat a patient for oxidative stress.

And that's sort of like where where that idea came from.

Yeah, so and then so the rest of the article goes into like quite a bit more, but I don't

know if we need to cover up to answer your question.

The process is there are pretty complicated, but basically it was noticed in maybe January,

February in some of the studies that came out of Wuhan that yeah, because you have a

competitive binding of some theory when, but you know, it has more nuance to it now,

was basically the glycospite proteins binding to the ACE2 cell membrane enzyme.

It's a competitive binding, which basically means that angiotensin 2 cannot enter the cell,

cannot bind and enter the cell, right? So one of the things that's characteristic is a massive

spike in angiotensin 2 in the blood. That's one of the big findings. It's just like

a massive circuit. And that's where the notion of kind of the competitive binding or something

like it came along. And the point about ang2 is the process by which it induces oxidative stress

is by basically increasing levels of, have you heard, did you come across something called

IL6 or interleukine 6? No, no, no. Well, would you spell it out? Maybe I have.

Yeah, IL-6 and cytokine signaling.

Cytokine signaling, yes, maybe I'm not sure. So the cytokine storms, right? So I don't know if

you're talking about if you're going that direction. Yeah, this is actually before you get there,

right? So it's basically an inflammatory cytokine and ang2 basically increases the levels of

interleukine 6. But ang2 in any case is prooxidant. That prooxidant leads to an increase of radical

oxidative, sorry, reactive oxygen species. And those specifically damage the ability of endothelial

cells to produce nitric oxide. So there's a super oxidation which causes something called

endothelial dysfunction. But more importantly, what's called decoupling of enos, endothelial

nitric oxide. And so what you have is the loss of functional nitric oxide. This is important

because nitric oxide is the only molecule that we know of that actually kills SARS. It was

discovered to kill SARS-CoV and also is effective against SARS-CoV-2. So basically you have this

increase in angiotensin 2, this increase in interleukine 6, this results in reactive oxygen

species oxidation of the individual cells and basically their denude serability to produce

nitric oxide. Important for two reasons which describe the pathology. This is what I realized

when I was looking at autopsies in April is that you have fully compliant lunges, but you have

massive kind of micro clotting in the ambient pulmonary microvascular chip. And so that is maybe

explained, well I think now we can say that is explained by basically the dearth of nitric oxide

because nitric oxide leads to a lack of ability to vasodilate. So you basically,

angiotensin 2 by the way is also a vasoconstrictive peptide. So you get massive vasoconstriction

and you have a lack of nitric oxide which stops you being able to dilate those vessels and ensure

efficient oxygen transport. The other thing is that nitric oxide is essential for anti-coagulation.

So it basically stops plate activation and thrombin formation. So it's the effect of oxidation

on damaging endothelial cells reducing nitric oxide that basically renders them then further

to the pro-inflammatory effects which eventually cause like barrier damage and that's when you

get leakage and sort of catastrophic downstream effects. That's more or less the kind of arc.

That's fantastic. I want to just pause myself for a second. You can keep talking if you want

Dexter, but also I want to invite Nick to speak. Welcome. He is the only person on right now who

hasn't spoken yet. And everyone else down below raise your hand and I'll invite you up to speak if

you want. Yeah, anyone who has a cure for COVID-19, you're welcome to the stage. Anyone at all?

Hey guys, yeah. Just listen, it's kind of funny because at the beginning of the whole COVID-19

situation in our department, so we're the Center for Integrative Brain Research, so it's a bunch

of neuroscientists and when I joined, I did my dissertation in physiology. So I was pretty much

in line with a physiology background and ended up, you know, for the first like two or three months

of the whole COVID and had to give a bunch of seminars to the departments to kind of get everybody

on board with what COVID-19 is or not even what it is, but how does the whole renal angiotensin

system work and how might it provide some targets for things to study because a lot of the different

institutions kind of, especially ours, you know, we essentially shut down most of the non-essential

research that was going on and then everybody was sort of hands on deck to develop either strategies

to test for it because we still didn't have a way to really test for it at that time or to try to

figure out what's going on. And the amount that it has developed since then, you know, it's kind

of laughable for some of the things that I was presenting. None of it was wrong by any means,

but it was so simplistic, you know, the fact that the spike protein would enter through the ACE2

receptor and you would get these increased amounts of angiotensin II by means of preventing the

conversion to angiotensin I7. And then, you know, from, you know, that was pretty much when we

started. That was where we were at. It was just kind of how do we figure out? It's not wrong,

but it's woefully incomplete, right? Yeah, yeah. So it's been fascinating just to see kind of how

it goes along. And, you know, we're still at this point, you know, I still have about 50 brains

right now that are sectioned and sitting on my desk from patients that have died from COVID-19.

And we're still trying to figure out the best ways to what we should label to sort of figure out

is it infecting the brain? Where is it happening? And how is it working? But one of the biggest

hurdles is that all of the patient samples that we end up getting for the most part are ones of

elderly people that have had so many comorbidities that, you know, how do you decipher whether or

not that this person has sort of a functional pathologic effect from the disease when the

patient was 88 years old and had severe dementia? You know, it's hard to do that because we don't

really have healthy controls per se because you're not really going to have too many very

healthy brains at that age. And so we're still trying to figure out, you know, one where, you

know, ACE2 is even expressed in the brain because that's still unknown to this day. And a lot of

the antibodies and stuff to mark that are very, very poor at best. And so yeah, it's an interesting

transgression, or I should say progression of the scientific aspect of studying it.

There's actually been, yeah, I think a lot that's come out of the pandemic, you know,

there are a few good things to say about it. But one of the things is precisely that kind of thing,

right, is that people who work on, you know, the brain that don't, you know, of course,

they talk about how it's embodied and relies on, you know, the rest of the system have kind of

had a very vivid demonstration, right, that these things, these things are exquisitely

independent on one another. So yeah, I mean, I'm no expert at this, but it occurred to me

immediately that the, you know, the focal brain damage that you were seeing that was reported

early on was probably not the virus getting into, you know, I mean, yeah, there may be a crossing

of the blood brain barrier, but it's far more likely to do. At least I think, you know, on my

view, basically COVID-19 is an endothelial disease, it's a vascular disease. And of course,

the brain relies upon, you know, very precise and exquisite arrival of oxygen on demand.

And the pulmonary microvascular is most vulnerable to necrosis, right, under,

but yeah, so difficult to tell whether that's just, of course, the case in all people too,

that they have, yeah. Yeah, I'd be curious, you know, I don't, I don't know if anybody's published

on it, but sort of there was that theory floating around that had some pretty convincing evidence

behind it, and not just from the bias that it came out of the institution that I did my dissertation

in, but the idea that for endothelial dysfunction, especially with that that occurs from inhibition

of, or perturbation of the conversion of ang2 to ang1-7, was that the, when they took a look at

the endothelial lining and the mechanism that led to the veil of dilation, you know, typically that's

a nitric oxide induced phenomenon, and after they took many different patient samples with, I guess,

quote unquote, endothelial dysfunction, because it's kind of a blanket diagnosis, but what they

were finding was that many of the patients had actually switched in that the blood vessels were

no longer necessarily responding to nitric oxide, but what they were doing was that they became almost

completely dependent on hydrogen peroxide, so the H2O2, in order to get that vasodilation, and

in any time that you're switching to a hydrogen peroxide dependent vasodilation, you get a massive

amount of this oxidative stress that goes along with it, just because it financials a little bit

more of a promiscuous oxidative molecule. Yeah, exactly, so there's some differential function

of production of endothelial nitric oxide under hypoxic conditions, and I think that's something

that's definitely worth looking into, and that that mechanism exists, and that there are actually

multiple ways, there are so many things which converge, and endothelial cells to produce nitric

oxide, and they are different under hypoxic stress, and so yeah, that may be one of the reasons, for

instance, there's a classic synthase process, but there's also a direct reduction, a production

basically from nitrates and nitrate, sorry, nitrate and nitrate, I think, is it, I think it's

a form of carotid nitrate? It's like, actually this is so long since I looked at this, it basically

is production from the ions themselves, and there's a reaction which can produce

nitric oxide in endothelial cells, which basically just uses, yeah, nitrite and nitrate, it's in

actually syrup, and yeah, basically produces nitric oxide under hypoxemia, sorry, two things,

I've just woken up when I'm looking through something that I wrote like a year ago, but

I think as I recall, when you say the production has become, the production of nitric oxide has

become reliant on like a super oxide, how would that work exactly? Or roughly? I don't know, I guess

what I was talking about more was that when you exposed the vessels to the nitric oxide,

they were from the patients with endothelial dysfunction, they were no longer getting that

dilation to occur, but they were getting the dilation to occur with hydrogen peroxide,

and then when they actually took the live samples from the patients that there was a much higher

amount of hydrogen peroxide than that of nitric oxide, so it wasn't a perfect study by any means,

but it certainly gave association that it was likely the cause of it. So yeah, it's definitely

the case that you have this decline in endothelial nitric oxide, I think that's what we're well

established now, and an increase of super oxide, but I just, I don't exactly understand yet,

maybe most likely a lack of understanding on my side, how super oxide in any case would cause

vasodilation, exactly, don't know, but there is, yeah, that's the furthering, I don't know, because

if that was the case, it wouldn't matter quite so much, right, that you had this super oxidation,

that you had this oxidative stress, and also one of the one of the important efficacies of

antioxidants, and particularly like as super oxide disputes is that it alleviates that super

oxidation, so I wonder, I wonder. It was only in, I think it was like only in 2015 when researchers

from Helsinki sort of understood the role of lymphatic vessels in the nervous system,

basically the article is called Unraveling the Link Between the Brain in Lymphatic System in 2015,

and so they're saying it's a surprising finding, challenges current anatomy and historical textbook

knowledge that lymphatic vessels are found in the central nervous system where they're not known to

exist, and so they're saying that, you know, they were found connected to the eye, and they're being

used to, you know, clear out, basically to clean the brain, but the lymphatic system I mentioned

is, the lymphatic system has cells that have endothelial lining, so it might not be like,

because it's like a new, sort of like a new thing, I guess, since it's 2015 that we're talking about

the role of the endothelial of the lymphatic system in the brain, maybe that hasn't yet been

connected, sort of broadly, and the fact that the target H2 might be in the lymphatic system

in the endothelial lining of the cells, and that's how the virus is getting into the brain

and causing inflammation in the brain. What was interesting is we missed, you guys missed Dr.

Sean, his last name is, I forgot his last name, but he was here earlier and he was explaining how

he thinks, yeah, Sean Orr, right, amazing guy, so he's a brain doctor, right, and he was,

he was describing how he thinks of COVID-19 really as a brain disease first and foremost,

and that it's inflammation in the brain, which is sort of like allowing the problems in the body

in other areas to not be solved. The brain is not responding correctly to fix those problems in

other areas of the body, so he sees the brain as having a central wall. This is really a brain

disease, more than a blood vessel disease. His perspective was really, really interesting. Wow,

that is super interesting, yeah. I've never heard that before. There's kind of a little, I mean,

you know, to a man with a hammer kind of thing, right? So it feels, the specialism is in brains,

but so he basically sees the brain, as in some sense, having governance over these

processes, which would, I don't know, the point about the immune response to a virus, right,

is that it's not supposed to, I mean, there are all kinds of conditions a brain can be in,

and all kinds of activation states, and all kinds of, you know, sleep, wake,

and, you know, things relative to stress, and the immune system, while it's affected by these

things, and you know, the two are basically intimately paired, it seems certainly counterintuitive,

because so many of the processes that we've been talking about are essentially processes which

are, you know, they operate in mice, they operate in things which are, you know,

yeah, basically, they have very different sorts of brains, but very similar sorts of immune

systems, which basically activate in very similar manners. And so it would just be,

it would be interesting to understand, yeah, I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry, I missed it,

how he would think that the brain would have governance over this, because there's almost no

literature, right, on certainly if you look at like, you know, like general viral pathology,

you hear about, you know, there's always this like, you know, can something cause the blood

rate barrier, kind of have like downstream effects on the brain, but almost never the causal error

running in the other direction, so that's amazing, very interesting. I'm just going to say you're in

luck, because Sean Orr, the PhD, is going to do a presentation on Monday on a clubhouse

on the brain in COVID-19, so that's coming up, and I'm going to ask him for more details.

I was just going to jump in, I found the article by the guy we were actually

went to graduate school together, Andrew Cadlich, but they were showing that hydrogen peroxide

directly stimulates PKG, protein finance G, which then directly leads to vasodilation, so

basically under under under basal levels, the shear stress on a non pathologic vessel,

shear stress, obviously through the can of transduction, stimulates nitric oxide production,

which then goes through a cyclic GMP, PKG, and with dilation, and then that nitric oxide inhibits

hydrogen peroxide, but then in the endothelial dysfunction patients, the shear stress actually

led to the upregulation of the hydrogen peroxide, which then directly

stimulated PKG, and then led to the basal dilation. So it basically activates the pathway,

this is sort of via another means, more or less. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. That's amazing. Wow. And so that

would that would seem to be like an evolutionary kind of a compensatory mechanism, right? Under

certain conditions. Yeah, I would assume so. I mean, I would be kind of like a redundant pathway

to maintain dilation. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know if you guys know, but there are three,

what seems to be like pretty effective therapies, contra COVID-19 like phase two trials now,

I think two of them. And they are, yeah, we have some therapies, which are highly effective in

patients infected with even like the dreaded like UK strain, the worst of all strains of the UK,

like most things. But yeah, UK strain and the South African strain, and they basically have shown

even in what they call heavily infected patients, like precipitous drops in viral load, like a 24

hour reduction of viral load of like 95%, 75, 72 hour of like 99%. And the operation of these

particular therapeutics will shed a lot of light on how this is actually playing out, I think. And

yeah, it's, there's a few, something called sanitize just felt with a stuff with a Z something

called proxolumitide, P-R-O-X. It's a high affinity, as I recall, engine binding receptor.

And then the other one is basically an exosome, so like an extracellular vesicle delivered

signaling protein called C-E24, which is, if anyone is kind of familiar with oncology,

C-E24 is a marker of, yeah, generally prognostic for the, so the poor, it's a poor prognosticator for

breast, I think, ovarian cancers, maybe a couple of others. But these are three different therapies,

but they all have this proxolumitide, so the statistics I quoted were from sanitize, which is

just an intranasal, as unlikely as the sound, sounds as just an intranasal spray. And proxolumitide is

an antigen receptor binder, so it basically is reducing or essentially ablating the ability of

testosterone to bind to receptors, but also the same thing they have in an infected outpatient

group, a rather large sample, they had a progression to severe symptoms of zero and hospital admission

and zero. And in patients who were in, basically in, who were hospitalized but hadn't been intubated,

they had something like, I think, only a three or four percent progression of the patients onto

intubation. And so, yeah, these sorts of therapies will, I think, give us some clarity

on what's actually going on. And I'm only saying this because they support my theory. I wouldn't

mention them for any other reason. But yeah. Oh, very cool. Where did you say those came out of?

So the first one is called sanitize. It's, was basically the, one of the co-founders

is Israeli, the company is Canadian. And so they've run phase two, phase one, phase two human trials

in Canada and the UK. And what they expected was that it would be just prophylactic, right? So

the idea that one of the main entry vectors was intranasally, and then this phase three

kind of went along with the people reporting, you know, a nose mirror and that kind of thing.

But what they discovered was is that actually, its administration to patients who are already

infected cause this precipitous drop in viral load. All they're doing is increasing nitric oxide by

their vertebrae. That's it. It's basically just a nitric oxide donor. That's all it is. It's like,

I think it's a sodium bound nitric oxide donor, basically. So that's sanitized. The other one

is called, it's by a Chinese company called, produced by a Chinese company called Clintor.

They're like multiple, it's a multiple site clinical trial and the drug is called,

if I can spell it, it's called proxellumetide. So P-R-O-X-A, then L-U-lumetide. You'll find it

from that. And then the other one is from Israel, but this one is just a observational trial. But

yeah, the same sort of remarkable results is interesting. This therapy is delivered by inhalatory

exosomes. So it's basically the CD24 protein contained within an exosome so it can, you know,

diffuse through the pulmonary microvestiture. And yeah, it's basically my sense is that the method

of action in every case, even though the therapeutic agents are different, is exactly the same. It

basically is differentially down-regulating. You'll have to help me out in it. It is the, is it, well,

N-K, let me try and remember, is it like N, it's an inflammatory pathway and it's like,

it's kappa, nuclear factor, kappa. Oh, N-F, kappa, N-F, kappa B. N-F, kappa B, thank you. Tip the

myotongue. So it's basically a differentially, differentially activating, also down-regulating

part of this pathway. And it very selectively suppresses tumor necrosis alpha into lutein 6,

gamma interferon, and what was the other one? I only know it by it's like after the mic. Do

you know N-C-P sometimes referred to as C-C-O-2? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, basically those,

those four, I think there's one other, but they all collectively inhibit endothelial

nitric oxide and they essentially mimic the function of estrogen, I don't know whether

you know, but estrogen basically enhances the production of nitric oxide. Basically,

estrogen can be converted to testosterone by some kind of aromatized process in endothelial cells

which enhances nitric oxide production, which may explain the differential effect

and you know, severe disease and morbidity between males and females. And yeah, that's,

if you look at basically, so what I did was was look at the patent for CB24 and its treatment

for, in cancer, right there, we're just looking at its ability to suppress information. The

specific cytokines that it inhibits are exactly the same as estrogen.

Yeah, literally, it's major effects on it, I think, about four or five specific cytokines,

all of which are implicated in reduced endothelial nitric oxide production. So my suspicion is that

what's really happening is, of course, when you increase nitric oxide by availability,

you are also decreasing viral load and nitric oxide is also in that sense able to act as kind of,

if you like, priming anti-oxidation, right? So it would make sense that just increasing

nitric oxide by availability would work. And yeah, you basically, in the case of these other two

therapies, they increase in the end the production and by availability of nitric oxide in the

vascular, that's my, that was my guess at April. Well, you know, these seem to sort of follow

those lines, but yeah, who knows. I was just looking up studies on estrogen to treat COVID-19,

that exists. Crazy, huh? Yeah, but it does, yeah. It's crazy. Now we've got to read up on those

therapeutics, so those could be cool for even for testing it as well in the lab. But I hate to jump

in and then run away quick, but I got to get some, I got to go to sleep, otherwise I'm going to be a

single man if I don't go to bed. I was just explaining, I'm just waking up from a nap,

so I actually have to go and make some coffee and brush my teeth. So yeah, I'm going to

mic down, but yeah, sleep well, and good to catch you even just for a few minutes.

Thank you, I see you as well. Thanks, Alex, and thanks, Micah, for the room and everything.

Thank you.

Take care.

See you later.

So I think Andy hasn't had a chance to speak, if you want to say something, you may.

Yeah, hi. Dexter made a joke who had called it a jump on the stage. So yeah, I actually had a

question to Nick, but he's out, maybe anyone can answer. So if so, call it a message from Sean was

that COVID is a brain disease. So is it any, at least criteria of how it can be identified?

Is it any, at least symptomatic, you know, or herd, which is available, kind of, or what kind of

disease are more frequent for after COVID and how you can kind of estimate the damage?

Yep.

So I guess Sean, Dexter's getting coffee. Would you just, if I'm going to answer that,

could you rephrase your question? And also if anyone in the, and down below wants to try to

tackle that one, they can raise their hand down and bite you up. But would you rephrase it, Andy?

Yeah, so if you consider COVID primarily as a brain disease, what would be the

symptom of, or how you quantify the damage for those who went through the COVID? Is it any

some particular symptoms, you know, or herd of, or is it any particular,

kind of, I don't know, any symptomatic, any research in this direction available, or you heard

the dog? Okay, so this is a really tough question. And so I've heard researchers say that it's,

it's still a problem in terms of trying to detect COVID-19 in the brain. I have a couple of ideas.

So anyway, so you may in particular want to tune in on Monday on Clubhouse when

Dr. PhD Sean Orr, he's going to present COVID-19 in the brain. But the, you know, his hypothesis is

that COVID-19, even more than being a vasculature system disease, and a disease that affects the

lymphatic system, he thinks that it is at the core of brain, brain disease. And his argument was about

how the inflammation in the brain that results from, you know, so I guess, so I guess, if I could

sort of like make a new argument, because as a relusinic, but, but, you know, people are saying,

well, so there is, there's in 2015, the role of the lymphatic system in the brain was kind of

discovered. So it's fairly recent. And it's, so there's a vast sort of like amount of lymphatic

system in the brain that is clearing out, it's basically washing the brain when you sleep.

And that's everywhere. And it's, it's, it has the cells in the, in the, in the lymphatic system

have the endothelial lining. So the virus is traveling into the endothelial into the lymphatic

system, and it's, it's attacking the ACE2 receptors in the, in the endothelial lining of the lymphatic

system, right? Some, like even Nicholas here, he's a neuroscientist, he says, we don't really

know where the ACE2 receptors in the brain are. Well, they're in the endothelial lining

of the lymphatic system. And then, and then so that process is, is literally destroying the

walls of the cells. That is a process that's similar to like an, it's like an extreme version of,

of oxidative stress in a way. Like, you know, when you have free radicals in there, like little

chainsaws and they're being thrown at your tissue, and it's like just your tissue is getting torn

off. So you need to take your antioxidants, right? To sort of like, to, to fight, to fight these

little chainsaws, you know, basically to help, help them get flushed out of your body, right? I

mean, this is, this, you know, I still would like, you know, other people who, who, if I'm, if I'm

going wrong here to, to try to speak up and tell me if I'm making a mistake. But that's, that's

my idea. And that if you are going to basically be doing a lot of destruction in the lymphatic

system and the endothelial lining of the brain, then you're going to be creating at the same time

at every stage of this, a lot of inflammation. And the inflammation is going to be happening all,

all over the brain. And as it does, as, as what's showing up, that, that means that your brain is

not going to be able to respond adequately to, to the rest of your body being attacked. And so your

response is going to be inhibited. So whereas, whereas a healthy brain would be able to help

you recover faster throughout your body as it's being attacked, your brain is being taken out

at the same time as your body. And so your brain is not able to help your body. And that's sort of

the argument for why the COVID-19 is a brain disease and why through inflammation, it's being

inhibited from helping your body. And at the same time, the, you know, what we, what you might look

for as a symptom would be symptoms of markers for inflammation. And, and I guess I could, I guess,

you know, there's, what are the markers for inflammation? I'm not the expert on the whole

stack of markers for inflammation. I barely know anything. But, you know, I think, I think, you

know, and I guess, isn't swelling like a, like one possible reaction of inflammation? So I guess

that could be one thing if you, yeah, in, in cavalitis is, yeah. And so we have, we have, you

know, MRI machines that detect blood flow. And there's also, you know, we can, we can image the

brain with light and, and, but there's, there's late, there's laser imaging that's much faster.

But what I'm saying is like, I think that if we have a fast enough, like maybe, maybe if we can

track like really blood, blood flow changes really, really fast, maybe with, with, with optical imaging

like FNERS or, or HDDOT or, or, or, you know, I don't know, maybe MEG or something. If we can,

if we can track, you know, really fast changes in blood flow, I don't know if MEG is going to help,

but, but the, in the situation, actually, but the idea is that that could be a way to identify

markers of, of inflammation or oxidative stress. This is all just like really like hypothesis

level stuff. And that's something that I would expect people to be doing tomorrow.

You know, basically like at the, at the clinical practice level, but, but maybe, maybe on the

research side. So, how do you? Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, that's interesting. And I'm sure he,

I'm sure Sean would know because your brain inflammation is a classic consequence of brain

injury, right? So, insults to the brain from traumatic brain injury generally lead to a cascade

of release of inflammatory factors. And that's very often why you have the first,

one of the first things you do with a patient with severe brain injury is,

yeah, you often just actually effectively drill a hole in the skull, basically, just to release

that pressure because it's, yeah, a lot of patients die just purely through the brain

inflammation. But the interesting thing there is, but that level of damage, that kind of

inflammation, there were certain kind of very common symptoms which are present when you have

profound brain information, which are things like seizures and the like. And there have been

seizures reported in COVID-19 for sure, but they're rather rare. And so, I wonder, yeah, to the

extent to which that can be a sort of, you know, this is the one thing which is always there,

which do you, you know, just regulates everything else. That's kind of interesting to think about,

can it really be, but in the case, I think, yeah, way to Monday, but you're saying it's really the

fact that the, it's really lymph node endothelial damage, which is in trading most of the effects.

Is that right or do I not have that? So that is just like a brand new hypothesis that I just came

up with, because there is a big question about how, you know, how the virus can affect the brain,

you know, besides creating inflammation somewhere else and inflammation traveling to the brain or

actually, you know, finding ACE2 receptors in the lymphatic system in the brain and that's where

it's attacking. I think that is most likely the case, but this is like new territory.

Yeah, I tend to think that that's also to do with the microvascular, that basically to the

vascular and microvascular vascular also, there was a recent study done imaging the

vascular of patients with long COVID and who have, yeah, focal brain damage and what they

discovered was massive damage to particularly the microvascular and so interestingly, this is

kind of interesting, if you look at the, well, you can look at the translation of it, but if you

look at the update that was given on November 13 by the, what amounts to like the CDC, China CDC,

they basically warn of this pandemic pneumonia and one of the symptoms that they cite

astonishingly is a necrosis of, yeah, neurological microvascular, which is very, very interesting

because that's not something that you, you generally put in a flu manual, but yeah,

nevertheless, there it is. Wow, wow. Yeah, that's what I said. I was just, it was same as you,

right, this was like, I spent like a month and a half in April and yeah, there were so few sources,

right, it was still called, when I started looking at it, it was still called NCALV 2019 and so I

was having to look at like Chinese sources, I have a few Chinese friends were translating stuff for me

and yeah, but yeah, it's, that was like a lights on moment, like, oh my goodness,

and so I began, yeah, to look at it as being, at least, you know, at least we can say that

it's not divorceable from the infractions to the vasculature and the vascular endothelium, but

yeah, very curious to find that and that's the data. They updated the nationwide manuals,

that is kind of like update to the seasonal guidelines that they've worn of a pandemic

influenza of unknown origin and they talk about, yeah, microvascular necrosis in the brain,

it's a very odd thing, but yeah, that's, that would explain a lot of the loss of function

and also, you were talking about anti-oxidants, right, and in particular, in particular,

n-acetylcholine, n-acetylcysteine and also glutathione peroxidase, right, so basically,

that's what n-ac does is basically raise GSH levels, so interestingly, for patients with

chronic fatigue syndrome, you often get my brain fog in these sorts of conditions and one of the

treatments has been sort of, for quite a while, the sort of gold standard treatments has been

to raise intercellular glutathione using, there's a kind of micro-filtered denatured way,

but also, yeah, n-ac was thought to be one of the treatments, but this notion of anti-oxidation

in some way relating to brain fog has been a thing for a long time, so yeah, this notion of

like vascular damage, which is infracting the ability of the microvascular chair to deliver,

you know, to basically, you know, entrain the efficient chemodynamics and oxygen transport on

which, you know, neural processing relies, seems, these things seem to be the same, one is entrained

by just opposite to stress and aging, and the other may be by the virus, so I was speaking to

Guy from Yale a couple of days, two, three days ago, and his view was basically one of a sort of a,

you know, having SARS-CoV-2 is like having your vasculature, you know, aged and accelerated

rate, that was his, everyone has a view, right, that was his. Yeah, I don't know enough about

the process of aging to immediately understand the analogy. Basically, oxidation, so there is

not that it's like settled science, right, but there's an oxidative or an oxidation theory

of aging, which is essentially that, you know, the human body kind of rusts is the idea, and so

that's where observation fits in that picture, especially where the vasculature is concerned.

Wow, so like that, that is, now I'm like thinking, okay, well what if estrogen is a treatment for

aging, you know what I mean? Well it is, that's the whole point, is that basically that's why men,

well sorry, I sound too confident there, sorry, it is theorized to be that this is why you have

much higher incidence, significantly higher incidence of hypertension and also cardiovascular

diseases in aging males versus females, it's actually called the estrogen protective effect,

but which is one of the reasons I started looking at estrogen in relation to endothelial function,

nitric oxide, and oxidation, yeah, I kind of tied those things together, just knowing about it,

so yeah. Are you writing books and papers? I hope so, because this knowledge

needs to be preserved and shared, so I hope you're writing. Oh, I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I'll

tell you what I did, I basically spent a month and a half on this and I just happened to know some

people at Columbia who are, you know, kind of like, they were, one person in that group worked

originally on isolating SARS and helped set up like part of China's CDC, the infrastructure of the

CDC with the head of the CDC in China, George Fugow, and so yeah, I just, I did what you did,

right, so I just wrote stuff up saying, look, this is not my field, but you know,

if you think paragraph one doesn't make total nonsense, you know, it isn't total nonsense,

you might want to keep reading, and so yeah, I basically tack it to something and sent it off

and yeah, just via a friend who was, yeah, sort of whatever kind of mediating that being

set and put together, so yeah, it's all basically there, I have the original sort of

sort of lights on sort of insights from April, but I talked it in May basically, because there

was so many competing, you know this too, I'm sure, if you looked at it, there were so many

theories of what this was, and I realized that though what I was sort of merging on seemed to

make sense, like I'm not an expert in that field, I sort of rapidly became one, and just over the

last two months, I've had a lot of questions back about, you know, what were you saying and what were

the references, so it's funny that we're talking about this, but over the last two or three weeks,

I have just been going over my sort of not rambling, you know, it's pretty well laid out,

and yeah, it basically has a causal sequence, it explains lots of things about pathology,

pathology I thought, but yeah, just a request for like, you know, what is the underlying evidence

and what's to emerge since, what papers and what research findings, what clinical findings and what

drugs support your view of the pathology, which is how I know about these three emerging therapies,

so yeah, I mean, it's, I was finally done with it about two days ago, but yeah, it's written down,

but I mean, it's not, I don't know that it's going to be sort of published anywhere, but yeah,

it explains a lot about all sorts of different, just one thing I'll say is kind of an example,

or do you know that UV has turned out to be, I think this only came out maybe like a day or

two ago, UV light has turned out to be quite an effective predictor of where you get major outbreaks

in COVID-19, I don't think you're done. What's the, what's the story behind that, UV light?

Yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry. Yeah, UV light, basically ambient UV light has turned out to be an

effective geographic predictor of where you get major outbreaks and major clusters of outbreaks

in COVID-19, and so I basically predicted that this was a result of two things, of course,

latitude, but then also pollution, pollution can attenuate ground UV in a, certainly in a

polluted city by up to 40%. I looked at Athens, sorry, up to 70%. I looked at Athens and also

some cities in China, some really polluted cities, but in Athens, I think ground level

attenuation of UV and Athens even in summertime is something, somewhere around 40%, but in,

I think it was like Guangzhou or some particular city in a province, they had done a study of ambient

UV and they found a 70% attenuation. What's important about this is, of course, everyone knows

that UVB is involved in the synthesis of vitamin D, right? And so there was this sort of vitamin D

sunshine theory, which is actually tied to nitric oxide, but the important thing is,

is that in addition to UVB, both UVB and UVA actually release nitric oxide precursors, so

N-nitrosophiles and nitrides and nitrate precursors from container storage upon exposure to UVA.

So I reasoned that basically it was this reservoir of nitric oxide precursors that would be massively

attenuated under insufficient UV, and that would mean that you had basically less bioavailable

nitric oxide to call upon to defend endothelial nitric oxide production. And then, of course,

nitric oxide in the end is, as I said, the only molecule we know of that is capable of actually

inactivating or, yeah, basically nitric oxide is extremely effective in inactivating bacteria,

protozoa, and viruses. It's used by macrophages and primarily by macrophages in viral clearance.

So I reasoned just the lack of bioavailable nitric oxide would basically potentiate,

you know, your massive disease, vulnerability. So if you Google COVID-19 and UV and if you just

include not vitamin D, I think it's a search, you should come across some research that came out

a couple of days ago from Edinburgh University. But yeah, it's a process which has only recently

been discovered that nitric oxide is stored in skin. What am I supposed to do? What would you

say again? I'd say, well, let me just, I'll just turn my mic off and I'll just try a Google search,

and then I'll tell you exactly what to look for. Okay.

Oh, hey, Mike and the texture. It's such a

information overload for me. I mean, as a layperson, that's a generally interesting frame,

but I learned a lot and thank you so much for, you know, running this.

Okay. Sorry, just to say, Frank, just playing my, and I think from Mike about like,

this is just some research that I did. I did with some competent and capable people, but

who are, you know, have years in the field, but I'm not one. This is just some research

that I did and on Mike's side, none of us are experts in COVID-19 just to be clear. But sorry,

go ahead. I think that was for you, Frank. What were you saying, Frank?

Yeah. So, yeah, still, I mean, very interesting. So, did Dr. Xiang or like,

mention what time on Monday, he will give, he will run the club house on COVID, right?

He might have, I forget. So what I did was I went and looked him, I looked him up

and sent him a message and said, can you, can you tell me more details? And so he may reply back

and then I'll be able to post that on Twitter. Okay. Just for a relevant pointer, I googled

up a relevant article title is the effects of COVID-19 on the nervous system. It's a

review article. I think it's pointing to the pathways to what was on some of the

in those, like related. So maybe I, you know, hoping that the people is

talk tomorrow. But yeah, I just throw it out there. But I'll, you know, I need to sign off and

hope, you know, to, we'll have this meeting again next week. Yeah.

Thank you very much, Frank. Thanks for coming. I want to encourage more people to come up on

the stage and just hang out with us. You don't have to answer neuroscience questions if you

don't want to, but we would love that as well. And, and then also, if folks want to invite,

if you want to invite someone or recommend someone, I think you need to be a moderator.

So just let me know if you want to invite someone and I'll,

let me just make Cecile a moderator. And so I don't know if the moderators can take a minute

to just invite some people who would be interested in a talk about neurophysics,

nerves, gear, the brain, vibrations and oscillations. Maybe we can get the group to keep going. And

so I'm just going to take a minute to invite some folks.

Let's see. And also, and this is like, it does a double purpose. So it's like, while I'm inviting

folks, I'm actually giving my brain a little bit of a rest because, because it's, this is not an

easy conversation for sure. Let's see. I'm inviting. There's so many people who, who follow me. Oh,

I guess there's a fun, there's a little mental. Let's see. I'm trying to just click a bunch of

people. I don't know. It is past 11. So I guess some of these people might not be around. And

we'll resume talking in just a minute. I'm just going to exhaust my invites out. If folks want to

to send out a bunch of invites or for it, you don't have to be here. Yep. Might, might you just say,

I had some search chance for you when you're done. You'll be able to find this article.

Okay, go ahead. So let's, let's type, let me type in the article. So let's go ahead and do that.

So I'm done. I've maxed out my invites for now. So anyways,

guys. Okay, cool. If you search for, if you just search for sunlight, sunlight, COVID, and then

just SCI, TECH, SciTech, it's a kind of like popular science article, but it links to the

study from Edinburgh University. They've been tracking this for a while, trying to figure out

why UV had this effect. And they originally reasoned vitamin D, which I didn't think was right,

but they converged on nitric oxide as possible, possible cause. And the interesting thing about

this is just a non canonical means of deriving nitric oxide, which is, yeah, fairly recent.

I think it's within the last 10 years that it was discovered that basically heat and light

entrate the rapid release of N nitricophiles, nitrate and nitrite anions from container storage

directly into blood where they're reduced to nitric oxide in blood cells. And that this is

basically a likely, well, no, I hypothesized that this is one of the reasons that body temperature

is elevated in, in disease state is one of the things it does is release nitric oxide, which

basically kills, you know, bacteria, bacterial infections and viral infections and the like.

But yeah, that's a little bit of, it's an interesting prediction. It's interesting

to look at something when you're looking at a very small kind of bit of the kind of vascular

architecture and thinking just like, where on earth does all this nitric oxide come from?

Like, where is it stored? And so when I thought that way, I realized it must be some massive

store, we don't eat a reliably massive amounts of nitric oxide. So yeah, it's basically taken in

and stored for kind of as needed. And then there's a cyclical process, it's kind of reduced back.

And since the skin is the largest organ, you know, in the body, made perfect sense that

that was the place to look. And so yeah, I discovered that that is a recently observed

phenomenon that you can basically, you know, on call, trigger massive amounts of the release of

nitric oxide, which is, yeah, interesting. And it was a very odd way to stumble upon it.

Let me just, I do have a question that I want to drill in deeper, but I also want to give

Cecile a chance to talk. Welcome, Cecile.

Okay, so it sounds like Cecile is going to talk later, because the signal is bad. That's okay.

So I would like to then, oh, but Cesar isn't it down there, let me invite. And then anyone else

who wants to come up and talk, just let me know and I'll invite you up, just if I, and okay.

All right, so let's keep going. So the question that I had for you Dexter was, what do you think

the precise mechanism is for, for nitric oxide to attack the SARS-CoV-2 specifically?

Oh, you mean the means by which it disables it precisely?

Yes. It's, it's, I don't know in a kind of like very deep biomelectric sense, but

nitric oxide is broadly toxic. So, yeah, it's, if you like, it is used in just about every

instance where, well, not just about every instance, but in many, many instances where

a broad range of, as I said, protons, that bacteria and viruses are attacked. So there's

no particular kind of, yeah, for the purposes of kind of my inquiry, the exact method of that

action, I didn't need to investigate, right? It's just well characterized. And we already knew in

2005 that end nitrosophiles were capable of reducing the replication of SARS-CoV was one of

the few agents found reliably to do it. And the thing about nitric oxide is that it's basically

inherent to the body, right? So you're not, you're not using any sort of, you know, foreign,

many of the treatments which have been tried are incredibly expensive, have really nasty side

effect profiles, but are, yeah, they're essentially modulating immune pathways in very unorthodox

ways. In some cases, it's not even clear exactly how they do work, but they, but, you know, their

efficacy is very, very low. So, you know, like remdesivir and the like are, but nitric oxide

is basically native. There's one thing, interestingly, I don't know whether you heard, but maybe in

around June-July time, there was a kind of breakthrough reported about, which related to

dexamethasone. So basically, gutocorticoids, anti-inflammatories, I don't know whether you

heard about that, but there was something like a... Yes, I did. Yeah, so the story around that

is basically that dexamethasone, well, the story as writ around that is that dexamethasone

basically is an anti-inflammatory, and so you're trying to fight inflammation,

but that's a double-edged sword because the sort of classic, you know, as deroidal anti-inflammatories,

anti-inflammatory medications reduce, you know, they suppress the immune system,

do you really want to be doing that? And so the effect of dexamethasone is interesting,

because what dex actually does is under conditions of hypoxia, it actually

conserves the production of endothelial nitric oxide. So I think the method of action as to why

that particular gutocorticoid turned out to be so effective, and others have turned out to have

moderate or actually deleterious effects, is actually because of the specific

action of dex relative to endothelial nitric oxide. That's my thought.

Yeah, you know, so the downside to dex, so dexamethasone, which can be abbreviated as DEX,

that I read was that it increased oxidative stress, and that is basically the core issue

with what? So it addressed inflammation, but the core issue was oxidative stress,

and dex actually increases it, so it could be effective in a late, maybe in a late stage of

COVID when the patient is primarily dealing with inflammation, and less so with the cause of the

disease in the first place. But on the whole, I think it's just, it's something that treats

sort of a symptom of a cause, but that symptom of a cause is a cause of another symptom, and so

you can see that it's being effective, but it's not treating the root issue, which is so dex is

really the wrong idea. But I had something else that I was going to throw in there,

when we got to the topic of dex. Oh, oh yeah, so okay, so okay, so okay, so

nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide are, they both, they're both toxic to germs, right? They

both kill bacteria, they both kill viruses, and just like, you know, just like rubbing alcohol,

right? But the thing is like, I think that in the body, the way that they're acting is different,

so in the body, I think that both hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide are, as we've been

talking about this entire three hours, they are vasodilators primarily, and they're improving the

exchange of gas in the lungs for one example, or improving the blood to better oxygenate,

oxygenate because the blood vessels are, because, okay, so you know, the A2 system or the A2

receptors are degraded, right? And so you have too much vasoconstriction,

and so what I think is that the nitric oxide and the hydrogen peroxide as being vasodilators

are allowing the blood vessels to consume oxygen, to help your blood to consume oxygen,

because otherwise the blood vessels are too constricted and oxygen can't be consumed,

right? That's just a hypothesis, and so it may have nothing to do with killing the virus. The

reason why nitric oxide might be useful in the battle against COVID-19 may be really just about

one thing, that's vasodilation, so your body can uptake more oxygen, in which case you could

substitute nitric oxide for any kind of vasodilator, and you would have a similar benefit, if that's true.

Yeah, I can see why one would be led to that conclusion, but the effects of

nitric oxide of pleiotropic suburbs, basically nitric oxide of course is involved in vasodilation,

but it's also involved in the inactivation of viruses and the like, but it's also involved in

the down-regulation of plate activation and also plate adhesion, so the catastrophic clotting that

you see in COVID-19 can't be explained in quite the same sense by super oxidation, right? But it

can be explained, all of it can be explained theoretically by a lack of viability of nitric

oxide and also a biphasic switch to inducible nitric oxide, so massive production of nitric

oxide from macrophages, which in the end at one level the production of endothelial nitric

oxide and a production in macrophages is great, but once you get the cytokine storm which leads

to an upper regulation of all these cytokines and also entrains a massive production of

inducible nitric oxide, you get something which is extremely, basically entrains a barrier function,

compromise a barrier function. The point about this is actually more than anything I can say

is that there are two things which are absolutely kind of staples of the endothelial

co-morbidities which potentiate the COVID-19 disease of mortality and all of them basically

feature, as a general feature, vitamin D deficiency or insurgency, but also a lowered

nitric oxide via viability and so that initial viability is kind of like a lowered viral

defense, but also is a kind of diagnostic of a pre-existing endothelial dysfunction. So

the reason that I honed in on nitric oxide because it just explains so much, right? The

nitric oxide explains why you see the geographic distribution that you do, it explains the

differential vulnerability between the sexes, right? This estrogen protective effect because

estrogen entrains the enhanced synthesis of endothelial nitric oxide. Something like that

basically protects endothelial nitric oxide production under hypoxia and there are just

so many facets of the disease which were a complete mystery when you look at them from

this angle, it begins to explain them, but who knows? So when it comes to thrombosis factors

or the blood clots, there's a lot more to them. So the loss of ACE2 receptors and the loss of

nitric oxide is going to contribute to the constriction of the blood vessels and also the

degradation of the tissue is going to release a whole bunch of thrombosis factors

or blood clotting factors like von Wilibrand's factor is an example.

I see nitric oxide is a big part of the story, but the blood clots are explained by more than

just that. The constriction is not just nitric oxide, it's the ACE2 receptors and the blood clots

are not just the lack of nitric oxide, it's the von Wilibrand's factor and other thrombosis factors

that are released from the cell lining. I'm not saying it explains everything, but if you don't

have nitric oxide to basically counter those thrombotic effects, they'll just run away with

themselves. The whole thing about really SARS-CoV-2 is that it entrains a series of vicious loops,

one which basically leads to the overproduction or the circuit of serum ang2 basically as the

virus spreads, you basically reduce or ablate the ability of this conversion of ang2 to ang1

through 7th right, so you just get lots of ang2 in the blood. That entrains into Lucline 6,

that increases oxidization, that depletes endothelial nitric oxide, that allows the virus to replicate

unchecked and that's a chain reaction which just begins to run away with itself.

It eventually doesn't need the virus to be there, which would explain why in long COVID you have

people who are long covered but they basically have a progressive degenerative endothelial

condition. The point about nitric oxide relative to thrombotic, relative to hypo coagulopathy is

that nitric oxide is, yeah it does two things, it basically reduces cellular wall adhesion,

right, so the kind of stickiness of clotting factors to the endothelial lining of the vasculature

but it also reduces platelet activation. So the fact that you have like on Willerman Factor and

Thromben, it's the fact that these are basically in abundance without nitric oxide that basically,

yeah, entrains that catastrophic clotting. So I'm not saying that it's just

nitric oxide on good, off bad, it's more complicated than that but I'm saying it's involved

in all of the major manifestations of the pathology, even at the level actually of the

yeah, the infractions to the heart and the like, yeah, it's involved there too.

So maybe kind of one of the places we're talking about, one of the features of COVID-19 is

hyperkalinear and renal failure, right, so the vasculature of, the renal vasculature is basically

extraordinarily fine, the innovation of, yeah, the renal system is exquisitely fine

yeah, vessels and they are extremely susceptible to this kind of endothelial dysfunction

uncoupling of enos and so it would make sense that one of the most vulnerable

parts of the entire system rather than the liver or the heart would be kidney failure,

renal failure, so I don't know, you know, there's, as I kind of said previously right,

it's like if you have a hammer, it looks like everything is an ale but it's just, yeah,

it's effects are so pliotropic that you begin to see that all of these things

basically are connected to production of nitric oxide, for instance,

vitamin D deficiency, so you were talking about vascular antioxidants, right, so the endothelium

is richly populated with VDR receptors and vitamin D receptors basically act as the primary

antioxidant which prevents the uncoupling of enos, so basically if you like stops the degradation

of the micro RNA which allow this synthase process to occur, so that connects too to why it is that

pre-existing vitamin D deficiency eventually results in this lack of biavailable nitric oxide,

so there are some studies done on basically umbilical cords like Hubex treated with,

let's see, treated with vitamin D and they were basically protected by vitamin D against

super oxidation, so you could rescue endothelium nitric oxide if you had a pre-treatment with

the steroidal work with calcitrile basically the kind of end biavailable component of vitamin D,

so these things tie together in a particular way vitamin D and nitric oxide which have kind of

long been implicate vitamin D is now a well-recognized you know prognostic indicator of poor outcome,

I think it's really just an indicator that you have low nitric oxide by the biavailability and

likely pre-extant endothelial dysfunction. Yeah this is a really, I learned an incredible amount

today. I'm gonna shut up actually like it and we're gonna wait till Sean's talk right because

I'm super interested because his take is the causal error runs the other way right and I'm

yeah I'm really interested to hear how that how that plays out, that's super cool. Yeah I mean

sorry to interrupt you. Shut up now. Yeah no I mean I was just googling Sean or in finding all

sorts of astonishing things that he's been in the news about which I won't mention tonight

but but people can google if they want in it so I don't know exactly what to

I know what but but it should be interesting so I will

oh okay so hey Dexter what do you think about these like in terms of what

these pre-workout like like or vasodilators you can buy over the counter so there's like

vimpositine and like like there's a whole bunch of like nitric I guess nitric oxide boosters

that that weight bodybuilders use do you um yeah do you like any of those? I don't take any of them

so well yeah during the pandemic so I just I really just couldn't comment I don't I know

yeah of course athletes take nitric oxide boosters just to boost the bioavailability of

nitric oxide specifically for yeah as you know like vasodilation but one of the studies

kind of been known for quite a while but just if you increase the dietary intake of

nitrates they will be reduced to nitric oxide so a good dietary intake for the average person

is really all you need but there was a study done which was done with a concentrated beetroot

which showed some performance increase I believe it was in sprinters I'm pretty sure it was but

yeah it was kind of like after some days of taking this concentrated beetroot juice which is in the

end just nitrates like it's just like increasing dietary nitrate intake they showed some yeah

increased level of performance and it may be actually one of the reasons why exercise has

prophylactic effects against viral infection because you are basically you are yeah if you like

in training the release of these precursors from continuous storage but um yeah when it comes to

stuff that athletes use they use so many strange things often just because companies have been

able to make them sound scientific and expensive so I just that really don't uh yeah I don't know

enough to say so yeah sorry okay uh so Carl's here uh Carl if you want to talk for a little

bit I I I definitely need to give myself about 30 seconds to 60 seconds to recover so I'm just

gonna mute myself um Cecil did you uh I saw your mic at some point

in our conversation did you want to say something

please I know this one surprised me but I'm sick of the sound of my voice please just

let me just invite everybody up I hope somebody says yes invite

hi my name is Chris and uh thanks a lot I am completely unqualified to comment on this discussion

but I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate it and I especially wanted to commend you Dexter on the

rigorous typography of your profile it's really it's really beautifully laid out I gotta say just uh

as a retired graphic designer it's um probably much better that's funny thank you just me too

former former yeah well I sometimes still do graphic design but yeah thank you so much um

if you're a graphic designer um of a certain kind of bent right you look at a profile and you're like

ah this bothers me typography is not right and uh yeah that's something that sort of never leads

you alone to come from art school time so thanks for noticing oh well I mean your your credential

I'm really just been satisfied to make decisions about what things look like but your profile is

is much more impressive and and a wide range of interest and I just thought I'd comment that my

own sort of amateur interest in uh neurophysics neurology consciousness etc actually was cultivated

in graphic design as I was obligated to have conversations about why we should do something

why we should make certain choices and and you know I used to laugh that being an art director is just

being paid to be the most opinionated person in the room but it was actually I was actually

I think the person in the room who was the most interested in the sort of consequences of the

subtleties the visual decisions we were making had consequences and I was prepared to

play with it so clubhouse has been wonderful in this regard I mean I I've actually kind of shun

social media I'm I'm not uh you know I'm not really all that conversant in a lot of the topics

that are hot here but I've been delighted to find so many highly highly credentialed conversations

about neurology consciousness intelligence artificial and natural and I've been really

quite inspired by the the clarity of uh some of the language so that's that that's that's what I got

I can yeah I can really relate to what you're saying just say that that kind of conversation

about SARS-CoV-2 not my speciality just like you know it takes years to really understand

that sort of thing and I've just yeah been working with people who you know know the subject much

better than I do even though you know maybe I had some yeah I guess now I can say yeah I I know these

things fairly well and but yeah just to say that that discussion I wouldn't include in that category

but um 100% yeah that's exactly the way that I uh my kind of inspiration for wanting to understand

was unlike all the other kids at art school I just seem to be thinking so much more about like why

why does this kind of like drops the position of things works so well and you know whereas

so many other all the uh yeah so many other of my contemporaries would just kind of do and either

would or wouldn't it's kind of hit or miss right they there was no particular process that they were

could be explicit about if you like and um it wasn't that I wanted some sort of rule set or system

I just made me so curious that the first time I painted something I was like I wasn't just interested

to kind of duplicate what I was looking at I wanted to understand light and I think that's um yeah for

anyone who is an artist or who's kind of played around with um anything like that the sense

and appreciation it gives you of the world kind of exquisite appreciation of the world

at the level of perception and musicians I think experiences too and third many musicians say just

like heightens your sense of all sorts of other things but yeah that's what art did for me and

it led to an eventual like wait a minute I am really interested as much as I am in you know

design and art and eventually film which is right most of my time creatively I'm interested in the

same kind of understanding of just how the world works how you know how does this all of this magic

you know which which which magic is kind of a romantic word but since since um you know we're

both from my graphic design land let's throw that word around um I became really curious about

what is what is beneath it that's rigorous um that isn't just sort of like talked about and

sort of very metaphorical kind of terms of um the kind of terms that you hear in art

critic use right which could mean almost anything I wanted to know really yeah there's so many layers

to the experience I think that was the first fascination for me before I had any of these

concepts or vocabularies I had this experience in which I was just fascinated by the the layering

and the subtlety and how you know shifting one thing has a cascading effect and you know this

this looks better like that and and you know just simple things like an art teacher telling me to

look at my picture in a mirror and see it in reverse and how that changes things and then it

was only later that I spent enough time with it and took on responsibilities and including the

responsibility to converse um yeah there was uh there was uh I'm sorry one second I'm gonna mute

for a minute I have to take care of something I'll be back in 30 seconds okay no worries take your time

so have we heard from hazel yet do you want to talk

hi guys this is hazel

maybe we should wait for chris to get back oh no no problem I'm uh I'm having an on-call function

and I just have to deal with something of indeterminate time so thanks sir thanks for

listening and I'm complete hazel that would be a cue if you want to speak

oh yeah um thanks for inviting me I am actually very interested to know more

about vitamin d I recently um got checked got checked and um my doctor found out that I

don't have enough vitamin d in my system so she gave me like 50 000 units of of that um

um she answered this a lot I was like I wonder why because you know it's COVID I live in New

York City I'm always indoors um so recently I've just been like forcing myself to go out there

um I mean I'm not a plant I should have told you I'm just being humorous about this but

I'd love to know more actually I you know when you were um explaining how it works I was like

looking at it and I was like oh my goodness it has um a lot to do with you know the heart and um

you know my my dad actually passed away because of a heart attack and he had a stroke like three

times so this is obviously like something that I have to be like very aware of so if he can just like

elaborate on that and I'd be very grateful thank you okay just quickly and it's not really the

subject of the room and definitely to underscore I'm not a doctor so it's um yeah just these are

kind of prompts for stuff that you might be interested in kind of looking into but uh definitely

not medical advice of any kind and yeah I this is yeah just some research just related to uh

uh some some investigation I did into sunlight and skin covering and um vascular health a while ago

but then yeah COVID-19 this all became kind of uh yeah um this was um just seemed like it was

prescient to the syndrome so it just in very basic terms um the story around bitumen d is that it is

common uh because you find common insufficiency of bitumen d in a whole range of different

diseases um you know it's associated with so many different uh syndromes but particularly

with uh diseases of the vascular and there have been uh your study upon study upon study

where it was thought that well hey if you just put bitumen d back in then you know you're just

going to reverse the fact that there is this deficiency and uh you know everything will basically

just quote unquote return to normal the the system will you know it's kind of like it's under some

kind of um allostatic load that it can't kind of return uh from right it can't reach a homostasis

because there's just this you know very low bitumen d levels just add bitumen d supplements and

um you know there's just like vast sway of health conditions should go away but this is actually

the reason that so many people in the medical community were skeptical of this idea that

bitumen d would have anything to do with COVID prevention or amelioration of symptoms or even

clinical treatment because bitumen d has failed time and time again it's just failed and failed

and failed and failed syndrome like you know reliable diagnostic criteria bitumen d depletion

um and then reliable failure of treatment putting you know bitumen you know adding bitumen d

supplementation and so i personal opinion um i think that um the experimental data suggests

it's something which which makes sense uh i think and explains um why bitumen d is so good

in a preventive role and but why it basically has this kind of failure to rescue um you know

all sorts of uh syndromes and again not medical advice and not qualified and just like a bunch

of work i did with some people who are you know kind of virologists who um are uh yeah far better

qualified than i but my uh my basic um uh conclusion was this that it's important to maintain

bitumen d supplementation or not supplementation bitumen d levels some might is best you obviously

don't want to be exposed to too much uv but some might is best but also dietary supplementation

is good it's basically when bitumen d reaches a state of depletion where uh it loses its

antioxidant effect in this case particularly uh if you're talking about you know atroscarosis

and cardiovascular disease and that kind of thing it's basically um that you get chronic

uh um oxygen stress and um once that occurs you get um irreparable damage to the endothelial cells

you get um endothelial cell uh necrosis and once that's happened putting bitumen d that

won't help anything really um any sort of antioxidant is going to have a limited effect

so the important thing is just to maintain healthy levels that that's really uh the story and uh

bitumen d um uh in the vascular endothelium uh is uh as i mentioned uh kind of critical for

defending uh endothelial nitric oxide production which is important for just general vascular health

for defending it against uh super oxidization and uh the kind of damage that i've been talking about

and so the bitumen d deficiency uh that you see in yeah classically in uh covid-19 it's uh um

a fairly reliable um you know um uh negative prognostic indicator um doesn't mean that you can

just like treat patients with bitumen d and they will you know all will all will be well

what that um bitumen d deficiency is really telling you is um that there was an increased

likelihood of uh compromised vascular function and it doesn't mean that it is the case in your case

but um it's just important you know uh just to maintain healthy levels to prevent that uh yeah

that oxidative damage which over time over kind of life course uh is eventually very difficult uh

to rescue so uh think of that's my unqualified opinion worth every penny you didn't have to pay

for it so yeah just some things to look into and if you're interested but yeah just a triple

underline i am not a physician but uh yeah just did some research on it

um thanks so much dexter i really appreciate that and you know for me i am i'm surrounded by

doctors um you know my closest friends are actually um physicians and yeah you know it

sometimes it's you know not to say anything negative but i actually um sometimes you know

some other people who actually didn't go to school have like a lot of knowledge um so i'm

i'm i'm pretty aware that you know some people that are actually don't have a diploma in medicine

actually have a lot of knowledge so don't worry about it i mean that's a double-edged thought

right there are people who uh yeah maybe haven't studied a particular um aspect of physiology

or disease uh and uh may have some useful things to say about it i worked with some people at the

national cancer center in japan who uh one of the heads of labs there has he has just developed so

many different therapies across so many different areas he's kind of um fairly remarkable in that

sense because you do tend to encounter a sort of hyper specialization not always but but quite often

but just to say there are lots of people who don't have diplomas and also talk absolute nonsense

maybe very very dangerous uh you know people who are far too confident that they you know

that something is the answer to everything you know and so i would just say yeah treat anything i said

is literally some lunatic off the internet and if you do your own research and it concurs that's a

good thing but um yeah i i definitely agree with you it's uh doctors often because you know they are

very often running on established knowledge and they are not necessarily uh reading the

the latest research nor should they because the latest research often turns out to be you know

then kind of walked back by subsequent findings so they're using a kind of aggregate of information

which is sort of known to be the case canonical knowledge which which has its pluses and minuses

right they're very unlikely to kill you by you know some crazy experimental treatment but they're also

unlikely to be at the sort of forefront of an understanding of something so yeah it's a double

edged sword and so um yeah i've endeavored to uh yeah just give you sort of you know sensible advice

which is you know fairly standard to the literature but again uh this is like my six on the line

you know not a physician so yeah just just say that but yeah cool thanks i'm very proud of you

you know hope it uh leads you somewhere i would like to uh um say something about vitamin d there's

uh as a paper you can you can look up uh it's called vitamin d and inflammation um potential

implications for severity of COVID-19 it's a 2020 paper you know the paper you look up is vitamin

d and inflammation in major depressive disorder that's also 2020 paper on uh they're both on pub

med and uh there's um there's a 2018 paper the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin d and two

more genesis and um and so the reason i i pointed those three papers um as um as you can look at them

and uh and um and consider the role of vitamin d in reducing inflammation uh

if i uh uh i just to quickly um coming to the point of vitamin d use in uh

inflammation it is a restreet specifically in the upper respiratory infection where your

your cells started responding when t u generates some cytokines and vitamin d actually uh chillate

those uh that's how it becomes uh anti-inflammatory um the main point of this thing is the how vitamin

d helps uh so my research spins around um cardiac health and vitamin d sometimes it is um really

helpful in uh using the stress through various mechanism where once you have generated stress

so it activates a specific pathway which we call an rf2 so that downstream helps um capturing

rows and and promoting some good genes who which helps us fighting against any any kind of stress

and this is also in the the cardiac function how we supplement it with because astronauts often

shall be challenged with vitamin d deficiency they do our own laws and they are that the good

supplement is vitamin d3 uh in the heart actually it helps pumping because one of the major element

of cardiac function is calcium and it it's supplement to it and and so if vitamin deficiency

has been very common so you have to be regular with vitamin d supplements and of course this

been found with um COVID-19 that it helps really in um upper respiratory information which is uh

specifically we considered as um uh in the lungs when when the you've been in contracted with COVID-19

vitamin d plays a very crucial role thanks so just to say though uh have a second just to be clear

when you said um captures ROSS would you summarize that as an antioxidant process?

but directly it don't act as a ROSS scavenger however the vitamin d3 um boils down and uh

helps downstream expressing nrf2 pathway I don't really know whether you've been familiar with

how uh this process all work it break down through through um through a enzyme which is called

cytochrome uh cytochrome some enzyme number I am forgetting but cytochrome like p450

or something some some variant of it and then it activates couple of um couple of uh ROSS

um preventing genes which is mainly nrf2 uh and nrf2 is actually a very um health gene

reducing your cellular stress so that's our cellular mechanism and we use vitamin d to

sometime reduce stress in the cells and that that's basically uh like a pan-spectral right

that's not localized to any particular organ that's uh it's coming to effect right absolutely

absolutely yeah that knows who mechanism vitamin d3 uh at least uh it's always been supplemented as

given as supplement directly uh medicine effect uh uh in mostly bone loss case we came across we

generate some kind of model to simulate however vitamin d always acts as a supplement yeah um

and uh also vitamin d has been uh implicated as a uh down regulator of the renin angiotensin system

as well and that's thought to play some part or at least hypothesize to play I don't know whether

you know but there have been some studies which have um observational studies uh they were

predominantly out of Spain but there was one that was conducted somewhere else so one use one use

basically uh metabolite so use the calcifer diol at high doses um it was um uh study conducted

under the fear and they had um you know an extraordinary result so claimed for high dosage

administration of vitamin d like kind of mega dosage administration in uh yeah hospital in

hospitalized and I think uh in not sure if it was incubated patients but the uh theorized role there

was basically um yeah an anti-inflammatory role which was uh hypothesized as being a down

regulation of the rest you do you know anything about that um not top of top top of that like I

cannot play right now remember it's maybe it's morning and maybe if I be looking into but of

course vitamin d it's very um for me I think it plays a crucial role in endothelial like

cardiovascular pathway and our model system what we want is stem cell derived cardiomyocytes

we extract treatment and we expose them to different microgravity and then we realize the

um that the the stress which is been marked and we try to chelate with um couple of cross

scavenger and with the supplement like vitamin e vitamin d and we really really observe that

vitamin d also very helpful in the like bringing back the stress down and the bring restoring

the contractility functions uh so um maybe my work area spins around that so I don't really like

cannot inside missing something so I cannot answer right now about it I'm really sorry about

I don't know no worries I wanted to say uh welcome uh Abhisheka um is that the correct

way to say your name yes it's very good um would you uh I've never heard of a gravitational

biologist before but I feel like I should have could you would you tell me about your work I'm

just so interested okay um so I'm currently stationed in Germany and we're working with

German Aerospace Center um it's similar to to NASA where M3 center people work with different

kind of model system and basically our team is looking for microgravity and it's and it's usability

what does it mean like we have to utilize the ISS or international space station for some

better cause and where we can very quickly um as utilize for the production where we cannot skip

gravity when we do some science in the lab so what what we do we simulate gravity by several devices

on ground we have parabolic flight which goes and simulate gravity for a couple of seconds

and different other like satellites small satellite uh rockets and and of course you

have ISS for for uh real and then how does this happens because um uh in stem cells they they've

been researched that when you grow stem cells on space basically if you look at the bioreactor

it continuously spin it it keeps the the cells in a floating condition which is free uh falling

a free falling it means like you you go to a ride and I don't know what's it like the big

field you know then you when you come back you really feel that you are losing uh or you are

you are your weight becomes zero and you are falling down so so this is a kind of uh

and a scenario where your um body doesn't act uh in the in the similar direction of gravity vector

so that is the idea like if we cultured cells on on microgravity condition so we can produce a lot

of cells compared to to ground so these are the the things which mostly me and my colleagues here

we do so we do basically uh human biology to understand how we can simulate uh digits on on

gravity condition in the in the zero g or moon g or mass g um then how it beneficial to the to the

to the pharmaceutical here that the usability and second I would try to understand the biology

being affected by by gravity so I didn't take much time uh no I I I for me personally I I I I

still uh would love to hear more but um but did anyone else have any questions about what they

about um gravitational biology oh we get a hand raised I mean I'm gonna bring this person up

okay so um hi there hi thanks for bringing me to the stage that's actually very interesting

and like you have never heard of this before I'm a neurologist so I'm on the other side of the

spectrum I'm in the clinical field so simple a couple of simple questions the first one is

what's your um for the the gravitational biology that you're studying how much time of exposure

to low gravity do you have by using these methods that you run that you have at your head

and then another question that must be it's probably very silly I just hope it doesn't sound

inappropriate but how much money do you spend in these studies and who's funding it thank you

nice the simulation studies actually doesn't cost much first of all that the simulations are

ground based where we create a rotation device you can very quickly look maybe sometime uh

clinostar rpm random positioning machines so these are ground based facility which cost very

nominal until your exposure time is on your hand depending on your expo experiments since it's a

rotation um so mostly the the exposure time limits to continuous exposure time limits for

for our study or when we when we expose the stem cell derived caduomyocytes and the limits to 48

hours the continuous exposure because since they are rotating and the cells also generate some kind

of gases and that's gases over the time accumulate and become very dangerous to the to the uh since

they once the cells produce the gas and then the gas is a bubble that bubble gets continuously so

that brings another aspect of uh of a physiological challenge than the gravity so before like because

we study 24 hour 48 hour 72 hour so then we realize okay 48 hour is a very limited uh limiting time

and um pushing it to 72 hour we observe some some at a means other uh bubble rated stress and

scratch so that um that may be answer for the ground simulation and then we have parabolic

light where you have only 20 second exposure but that will be repeating for for 30 time so

hypergravity microgravity than hypergravity is basically a crazy flight which goes up and

performs a maneuver where you generate hypergravity than microgravity but those are very limited

like 20 second so which is very tricky to design your essay and perform something which you want to

achieve uh during that time then you have uh then you have uh rockets um sounding rocket which goes

and stays up to 15 second to some 15 minute 5 minute to 15 minute and they are also you have to

very careful design some experiment and perform and then you send some satellite which is sometimes

come back sometimes doesn't and then you design your study accordingly what you want to get out

from that experiment or you want to retrieve sample for some downstream study like gene

expression some protein look out or you send it to ISS through the Soyuz mostly Soyuz now

SpaceX is ramping up its its flight so all the the institute are line up for the SpaceX

and then it usually comes in sometimes two months three months or they drop it simply

without astronauts traveling back this is how the the experiments goes in a line so ground

based then parabolic flight then then rocket science rocket uh sounding rocket then then

then satellite and then ISS and also the money also goes in the same proposal for ground based

study you do not much investment you just simply you have a short small instrument and you um create

moon or mass gravity and then you expose yourself it's very nominal uh the parabolic flight

and it's like a little bit expensive compared to ground which is like because of logistics because

you have to support your experiment with some hardware and then then of course sounding rocket

another little bit high and satellite of course you have to project for the maintenance for the

radio team so and ISS yes that's also another big chunk of money goes there when you design

some experiment because of mostly because of hardware limitations backups all these things

we have to keep in plan because often space experiments have often been challenged with

a lot of failures and this is not ground that you will repeat again so we have to send with

some backups that's how also money money runs and uh do you mind if i ask you uh i hope i'm not

taking too much of everyone's time so what are you trying to measure here are you trying to measure

muscle contractility or are you trying to measure cell survival um function efficiency

what are what are your outcome measures for this these studies oh these are because it's very

because i has a last question about vitamin B deficiency that's how i ended up here so we

uh we when we expose the cells these are the very um unique kind of cells and

some stem cell derived we came across as these heart cells it's uh they've been when we expose

we find a whole parameter ion like movement change we find microcontrail changes we find

stress huge stress um being being on the earth we did some um all the parameters basically proteomics

transcriptomics um then we saw some imagings and uh expressions uh there are a lot of things

actually change calcium homeostasis change um so this the basic function is uh if you

stay long in floating condition or free flowing condition so your heart needs to behave different

way and we have to generate that signal just for a quick example if i say just imagine the

fish the fish is actually swimming in the river and uh you see they are safe it changes uh why

it is like that and how it cope up with Beyonce because that weight is less and they they do not

have to pump blood to their tail and that's how their tail is more compared to thinner compared

to their belly but as case of human when we when the heart pumps blood so that we cope up with our

leg when we are in ground the moment we go to space and try to float our heart doesn't respond

that way our heart becomes very slowly they try to pump blood and then often since astronaut fly

they they they develop a syndrome called chicken leg so that leg become thin because the pressure

is no more they are and the blood supply become also no meaner because they don't use it they don't

use it neither there's something pulling factor and gravity i have then uh this is why we have to

understand why this and how we can help um by understanding the heart physiology how we can

if we are planning to to explore moon for longer time for much longer time how we can help

at the same time how we can model the cardiac biology for the ground what are the new things we

observe and how we can for the aging for one we are interesting thing we found that when we simulate

with we use cardio cells for the simulation we found that they are becoming the aged cardiac

cells so which is a very good model can be for some some pharmaceuticals to develop some drugs

when people go age and how they can cope up with the aged heart i'm i'm i'm not taking much time

now please so i can i just can i just say so i so the reason i i come to clubhouse and the reason

i i create groups like this is because i want to hear from the experts so if if if if george who's

a neurologist and abhisakha who is a gravitational biologist want to spend the next hour asking each

other questions i am fine with that if anyone else wants to ask them questions i'm fine with

that so i'm just going to meet myself and listen oh my is it mica is it uh yes mica mica yes mica

yeah thanks mica look uh it's very hard to ask questions when you know very little about the

subject obviously i can uh i can ask uh open questions and let him talk because he sounds

like a very interesting guy but um i think i i i think uh if anyone has a more directed question

i was thinking initially maybe this uh this group is studying this thinking about future

colonizations of the outer space and that sounds very interesting but i i have read a lot about

um space uh and physiology and uh i i have uh learned before about um uh muscle and bone

due to the generation you know these things but i don't think i i ever heard anything about

hard muscle so that's really interesting and i think sessio has a question

now that was it yeah thank you that's really interesting i i want i hope one day someone

does the same with nerve cells with neurons that'll be very interesting they do they do they do

because um when the fluid sleeps the the fluid sits towards the the head it creates a tension

in in the brain and it actually pushes the brain and um and it tried to to corner the brain

that the fluid sift happens in the space and where the sensory is being lost

so people are really doing a lot of uh um cna study and how they can help because

um i think i can remember which group i think riley uh from m's and here in german also they

are doing a professor professor and forgetting his name professor bunga probably they they have a good

research team on the on the neural activities and how i think um if you don't mind me interrupting

i think you would be very interested to see what this is to uh microtubule transport and

the reason why i'm interested in this is because there are some theories because we don't know what

consciousness is and the uh the sense of self is and there's a lot of people thinking that

microtubular function is key in this type of function function in the nerve cells so i was

wondering whether and i'll probably look it up whether this is something that might be pointing

that uh in space our consciousness has a different way of working do we get more

pathogenic or more sharp uh when we are in space and what sort of effects that would have in our

cell transport yeah yeah i think this is a very interesting area of working i think i'm sure

pretty sure people are working on it they they're pretty i'm pretty sure it's um some and even

even when uh when we read reports from people who came back from space and they start uh uh having

having different thoughts and maybe seeing things that they don't see not i'm not talking

about hallucinations but facing reality on a different way oh god you might be sorry

sorry that was an accident on my part oh no that's okay um but i that's fine i don't i don't

like the sound of my voice that much so i like when people talk with me but i i think um i wonder

whether this is what's causing astronauts and people who work in space to have these sort of

thoughts when they come back and they become very introspective yes yes you mean there is a club i think

a couple of scientists come from from the from the nasa m's and who do real human

astronauts behave your study and i think you guys probably know this twin study where scott and mark

been thoroughly studied for the closely one year they they've been in space and there are a lot of

skin sensories they found uh been changed in scott and they that was not been even published so

it was been a good discussion in in clavus as well i think you should follow jim i think

he's in the some some other club though um their team is studying the the the entire

umics and the physiology that you can get some good insight um i'm sure this is no for me

why this because when astronaut comes back they develop a syndrome called orthostatic intolerance

uh which is like um if it's simple terms i explain like if you are sitting for a while

and you suddenly try to stand up uh you fall down because uh your heart doesn't really understand

that whether how because when you stand up your head to produce more pressure to pump blood to

to brain and to your leg and that time your heart get confused and it doesn't uh doesn't pump that

way the way you expected so astronauts often fall down and uh that's it that's a common feature in

some of the neurological conditions like that people develop autonomic insufficiency that's

what how we call it yes yes that's why i said this uh and there where exactly we are uh trying to

address one part at least to boost the heart and make it uh somewhere we can able to address and then

and exactly there the the neural thing involved which not my my area of research

sounds like artificial gravity is going to be really important for long distance travel

yes they are creating uh they are i think bowing or bowing is constructing one

um circular simulator uh which will be continuously rotating and creating gravity

to help with the astronauts health yeah that's that's the that's the right news you have okay

i'm done if you anyone um so i know i was i was just uh so jen welcome to the room

did you want to tell us a little bit about what you do oh hey sorry about that by the way um

well right now i'm just a student and for electrical engineering and i just kind of do side projects

for research like with other friends in different departments you know uh mostly just kind of like

rereading their paper and kind of uh rewriting it sometimes so i kind of just jump into random

fields not really but yeah i kind of switched over from the medical side in pharmaceutical

which i did for my first degree and then i ended up deciding that kind of hate that so now i'm

trying out electrical engineering which is why i'm in this group because it kind of

uh sides with each other yeah that's uh that's exactly right so so you've got the you've got

the medical side of things and then electrical engineering is uh you know at the point when

we're we're connecting uh devices uh to our biology so that we can we can try to read and

write to the biology but you're but you want to be an electrical engineering side of things

that's very very interesting yeah i just kind of want to tinker honestly and kind of be in my own

world instead of working with a few people to be honest and what i actually live um in oklahoma

where bowing is and so we've got bowing tinker air force and quite a few programs around here for

specifically that and what you guys were talking about as well because yeah there's quite a few

electrical engineers around here to be honest um oh oh sorry keep going no i'm good thank you

i was gonna say can you speak to specific programs uh that uh that are happening around that

happening around or happening anywhere that you know about in terms of um uh combining

electrical engineering with uh with biology with with the brain or with the heart uh

just in oklahoma or just in general um i i have to first ask you about oklahoma but if um

but if you want to mention others it's fine well oklahoma definitely has to step up their game

with uh robotic um surgery uh usually to be honest because of the fact that i was in a pharmaceutical

side of things more like so i didn't really get to see more of the biological terms where it would

and with uh with the networking that i've done i'm kind of like i feel like a newborn

which is kind of why i've been jumping around in these groups to kind of actually figure out

a way through this with uh trying to work on different projects and see which one i want to

actually work on specifically because we also have like prosthetics as a huge thing over here

the way it's like this one company that um kind of done it for like a decade or so sounds good

feel free to mention these companies by the way i'll write them down in a clear middle list later

then i'm gonna share um i can tell you later i'm not going along i kind of get uh really flustered

when i talk uh to you know a lot of people i'm sorry i feel really ignorant

maybe we have to no no no this is very awesome that you explain help us understanding your

part of science and technology is the biggest part which i think slowly getting infused to to

biology and nano sensors even if um i think the way which we are seeing also you must

been heard about neural links right and gen what did you say with that last part

neural links from from your links yes so that's happening in the implantation in the organ level

but in cellular level also we are looking for some nano chips which can go into single cells

and give us some output so this has been also in a lot of already one being published but that's

with the with the group of cells or we call it organoids but we are trying to to to make some

nano materials which can be can be go to the cell and then outside we can read their signals so

we need a little engineering team which and they who have knowledge about signal readouts

are there and these are the facts also we are currently looking at at in a large scale also

how we can do the future studies that's really interesting i might actually have to read that

in the next couple days and uh if you don't mind i would love to um discuss it with you or

i mean within the group or whatever sure i appreciate that thank you yeah thanks

gen can you explain alternating current to me i'm not kidding

this is just like when someone asked me to say something in any language i literally

don't like i'm not lying i couldn't even sit think of hello or everyone not everyone i mean who

has any kind of qualified relationship to electricity i asked them to explain alternating

current to me it's you know much like you know in a certain type of restaurant there's a certain

dish you want to ask for to find out how they do and i've actually um i have not yet met anyone

who really felt confident that they could explain it the most qualified people really so as ignorant

because i'm literally looking it up right now um not my field but as i understand it ultimate

alternative current is to do with the efficiency that you achieve by switching and with direct

current there's an attenuation a loss over time and the basic thing with alternating current is

the phase uh prevents the uh yeah the loss of um transmission as i understand it actually now i

think about it i do have a book that i haven't finished that was actually that i had a graph about

that uh have you sent me to collect the room i just posted two studies to my profile which

explained uh the importance of vitamin d receptors in the heart um how it down regulates the renan

antitents ensign system and also if you knock out vitamin d receptors in the vascular endothelium

you get a drop in nitric oxide so i thought that would be useful to to the astronauts but uh

i guess they'll have to get by

um you guys i have to check on my gig thanks a lot um mike thanks very much for um the informality

my ability to come up and dexter and everyone thank you cheers thank you chris it's been awesome

right on hey dexter did you say that was on your twitter i'm like looking on your profile

for your twitter so i can make that one uh no no if you just look at the top of my twitter

there's like the top of twitter if you just look at the top of my profile i've actually posted the

study titles for both of those things you should find it oh okay i i got it i'm gonna uh i'm gonna

write it down or maybe i'll screenshot yeah it's just uh these things are so complex and there are

so many different areas of research that you meet people who are often quite specialized in the field

and um yeah there's just so much to know that uh as uh i think that's what people have said it's um

surprising sometimes what some people don't know there's just too much to know and also to figure

out what's relevant to what it's kind of tricky um jen how are you doing on ac current i just um i have

uh yeah just a vague intuition that it's uh to do with phase and efficiency so that you don't get

lost when you're transmitting energy over long distances think that's the big thing about acdc

but you may know better i say you might be completely correct it seems like uh with also

so it kind of does with the the pulsating and the alternating yes and the current of that but um

yeah now i have learned that i forgot everything at the beginning you know all your

journal studies i had is i'm actually having to start over entirely in the mathematics

next you got quiet you became quiet oh sorry i don't know what happened there

but oh gosh i lost my train of thought so something about starting over in mathematics

and then yeah it i could think i'm just having a poor connection it's showing you that so if

you guys want to go ahead and talk i think it's just my room it's just like that

um all right well i'm uh i'm i'm getting pretty uh tired over here i i guess i can

leave the room uh and uh to you folks if you want or or i don't know what you want to do but

i actually uh likewise yeah i've got the stuff i i'd like to get on with um but um i just want

to say like it's just so interesting uh to me that uh you and i both sat down uh yeah it's kind

of expertise in different subject areas and basically the same time and looked at basically

the same thing and uh that's pretty cool it's really interesting to hear your perspective on that

and especially uh to yeah i mean uh i think it's so great the general

phenomena of the pandemic that anyone who uh kind of um yeah so many people wanted to help right and

so um it's just so interesting that you investigated these things and uh engage with them and uh it'll

be yeah especially interesting to hear sure knows perspective on it and uh just say do you do you have

a time for that yet or is that still to be decided um i will um i haven't heard back yet so i'll uh

i'll post on twitter or um i don't know i'll probably talk to you before that i guess if you're

on clubhouse again yeah that'd be great cool yeah i'm sure okay or anyway thanks for the room and

yeah i'll be on my way thanks to everyone and uh yeah just to say super cool that you do that and

really interesting to hear your perspective on it and yeah to empty a chance could be super cool

all righty catch you catch you guys later okay i'm just gonna uh say good night everybody um

i think we'll probably close the room good night yeah good night good night all right good night

cool thanks see y'all thank you
