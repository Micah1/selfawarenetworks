why should this note be included in the book? It's speculating about the nature of spacetime with quantum gravity.

imagine that the neutrality of particles is because they are too warm, and that as the earth cools its magnetic field will grow as more of the atoms within it begin to oscillate inline with one another multiplying their netforce

earth will eventually become a magnet as it cools and as its atoms condense and align

the non-magnetic part of the EM spectrum is gravitational spectrum, it's about the oscillating curvature of space, the morphology of the vector field that has been embedded into the shape of space as part of the expanding wave of a dense oscillating particle, such as an atom or such as a star, each of which cast a wave into space corresponding to their scale (volume), density, heat, and its kinetic & angular momentum

since the spin can actually be separated from an electron we have to understand electron spin as a kinetic momentum.
