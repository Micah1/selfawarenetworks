Note the text & the audio differ somewhat so you might read along here while listening to the above link.

00:00

When I start the chapter on "Artificial Sentience" I want to talk both about the origins of the Star Trek Holodeck & Commander Data from Star Trek.

00:21

The according to Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodeck
"The Star Trek holodeck was inspired by inventor Gene Dolgoff, who owned a holography laboratory in New York City.[1] Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry met Dolgoff in 1973."

This actually ties into the discussion of using holography or the reversing refraction of light for medical imaging with which is what Open Water (A company by Mary Lou Jepsen) is doing.

00:51

Combining near infrared spectroscopy with ultrasound & holography.

It ties into how could you present a light field to a human being? What is a light field, what is a receptive field, what is an inceptive field? What is Light Field Labs? What is the concept of a Light Field for Magic Leap AR glasses, or a Light field in the context of Tilt 5's Holographic Game System? 

How might the human brain render a light field that represents the world around that human being?

01:44

Light field technology is being worked on by many companies both in California & around the world.

Light field lab as one example has privately shown people a Light Field Holodeck concept which is basically like a room with panels and each of the panels has basically a spherical pixel. So that the image that's created is different based upon your eye position in your room relative to that pixel.

(each Pixel is rendering a slightly different version of that same room, accounting for the perspective of what your eye would see if you were wearing VR glasses, from that perspective in the room, because the computer already factors what perspective that point in space gets, it's been rendered before your eye gets to that point in space.)

02:15

So your eye position relative to this, to the spherical tiny spherical pixels determines which side of the image you're going to see. So the spherical pictures divide up what that image on that display would look like from each perspective and they're rendering all the perspectives available for that image for the different eye positions that are possible in that room.

02:54

This means from above and below from to left to the right where your eye is. Where each of your eyes are is going to determine the viewing angle that you have on the image inside this screen of spherical pictures (inside spherical pixels).

This allows them to basically stack in an entire wall, from floor to ceiling, in every direction with a virtual reality without the glasses. Your viewpoint on the 3D light fields changes and is based upon your eye position in the room.

03:52

Light Field Labs, as I've heard described by others, is probably the closest experience you can have right now of being in a Star Trek Holodeck with real Holograms right in front of you.

Holograms that you can also interact with through body tracking, finger tracking, with haptic feedback effects.

So as you reach out, as if you're going to touch one of the images that you're seeing with this sphere, these spherical pixels in this room of 3D images, your body, hand & finger position is also being precisely tracked in 3D.

So you can feel like you can interact with these 3D projectors, with the illusion of these 3D projections being physical projection thanks in part to wireless haptic technology that stimulates your hands & fingers at a distance.

04:59

It's not actually projected out of the screen, but it gives you the real feeling of a hologram that you can touch & really interact with, thanks to the illusions of state of the art science & technology.

This is getting us sort of close to basically Star Trek's holodeck. I also think it's important to bring up the concept of artificial sentience.

05:33

Because in essence, what I'm arguing is that your brain is combining all of these pattern representations together to create effectively like a personal holodeck. That's a simulation of your perspective, in your interactions of an organism's perspective, an organism's interactions with their locations and space. 

The reason I will go so far is to say that your perception of reality is like a Holodeck.

06:17

And your brain is like a Holodeck that is rendering computer graphics. Like the light fields or like virtual reality, or like interactive computer graphics is, is because I have many life experiences that persuade me that this is the right conclusion.

I know that there is a long history of people being able to take psychoactive medications, like ayahuasca and DMT LSD, mushrooms that can alter your visual perception of the world.

06:51

They can make you see patterns where there are no patterns in the case of LSD and Mushrooms. In the case of DMT & Ayahuasca, they can change your physical surroundings, at least the appearance of your physical surroundings. One experience that I had with DMT, which I, which was, which I smoked, I perceived the walls to my left into my right basically sort of disappearing and in their place there was this sort of like infinite corridor to each of my side.

07:33

So when I had tried this I was in a room that was about eight feet by eight feet. And the result was that I saw a I experienced the walls of the room to my left and my right disappearing. In addition to that I saw Christmas elves and they just appeared on the walls out of nowhere and I had sort of like Christmas wallpaper and that wasn't there before I had smoked it (The DMT).

08:13

And so I had this expansive feeling of space that I could see out of the corners of my eye, and I didn't turn my head because when I moved my head it would break the illusion. But there were physical changes to the environment in front of me.

08:35

And it's very interesting, it's interesting because I would say that LSD and Mushrooms are sort of like the Augmented Reality of the psychedelic drug world and that they just put patterns on top of the reality that you're in right now. But you never, you don't really forget which reality you're in, right. With something like salvia divinorum or DMT both of which I've tried it's different, okay?

09:12

With LSD and mushrooms there, these drugs can be in high doses, they can be so powerful. they change your sense of who you are, but with DMT you remain as yourself and instead the world changes, your Holodeck changes, your rendering of what is real changes.

09:39

And so people have described their DMT experiences is like visiting other planets living other lifetimes in other galaxies meeting aliens from other parts of the universe traveling, the cosmos, some people have these really awesome sounding experiences where they were trying ayahuasca, and they pull out a phone that they actually never brought with them on the trip and they pulled out this phone, and they can now flip through all of their past memories as if all of their past memories were where somehow captured by this non-existent phone and they can sort of flip through their mind.

10:28

Like they're like, their brain was storing picture files.

With mushrooms and LSD, a person can sometimes see computer graphics that are not there. This is a common experience for me where I will see windows and I'll be able to basically render computer graphics by choice. I can, at least that's the way it feels.
10:59
It feels like I am rendering computer graphics by choosing what I want to think about.

My mind becomes, in the visual context, it takes on the forms of some sort of operating system that I can navigate and I can select what I want to be focused on.

11:22

I feel like the term (psychonauts) is for people who have explored their minds and in a sense explored the universe with psychedelic medicine, I can say that, you know, the correct term for that is a is a psychonaut, not but you are but a psychonaut uses drugs to sort of like explore the universe and explore their own minds and just explore reality and to try to understand what reality is and I think that my in my journey a psychonaut, I finally found a point where I can describe, what I think reality is to me and in a new way that I wasn't able to describe before.

12:11

And that is part of this book, but I'm very I've always been dramatically inspired by those words at the beginning of every episode of Star Trek. And the words go 'To boldly go where no one has gone before' right? And that is the mission of people who explore outer space with warp drives.

12:46

But it's also the mission of psychonauts who explore the frontiers of consciousness. Through the introspection of afforded, by psychedelic medication, In some cases, the feet, the feeling at least the feeling of scoring, the galaxy with Ayahuasca DMT and meeting aliens and traversing the cosmos.

13:16

These are some of the things that inspire me the most, and so when I think of basically the analogy is that the human brain basically is a kind of Holodeck that reacts. It models reality, a version of reality, and then it reacts to it. We know what we're seeing is a graphical interpretation of reality, and not like some objective real reality, because there are facts that are missing from this reality, such as the fact that the eye is covered in blood vessels.

14:04

And there is actually a blind spot in the center of every eyeball, a really large blind spot, and the blind spot is something that many people don't even know exists. And even if you do know it exists, you don't see it on a regular basis, it takes some special preparation to see it.

14:27

There's a trick to seeing your own blind spot with holding up a pencil eraser, about a hand's distance in front of your eye and then trying and then trying to notice when the tip of the eraser vanishes from your vision. I'm trying to see if I can do it right now.

14:47

The really big difference between the human mind and Star Trek is that every pixel in the human mind would be produced by a neuron, and every pixel would have a receptive field which would consist of its connections with other pixels.

15:20

# A neuron is made distinct by its connections, so when it fires a neuron's distinct pattern activates its connections, the oscillating group of neurons that are connected become aware of the memory that exists as the unique configuration of synaptic connections embodied by that neuron.

Imagine we're talking about a point cloud right? Every pixel in a hologram is like a point of light in a light field. Every light field is made up of rays of light, or phase patterns, or frequencies representing points of light and every perspective. How do these points in the light field connect? How would a robot recognize which points belong to which object? How would you?

15:51

The reason you can see a light field from every angle (and in a Holographic Display), is that the rendering of refractive light, on every simulated surface (every 3D pixel) is a projected perspective in a phase/frequency (wave/point) field in 3D space.

Point based lightfields are different from meshes because a mesh: imagine a 3D mesh or 3D (polygon) model, basically starts with points, but then there are triangles drawn between the points and surfaces added to the triangles.

16:31

And this is sort of done this is sort of done because I believe it's sort of done because you know she just looks at a point field close up. If you see a point field from far away, it may look like an image, but if you're close up (depending on the density of those points) you just see points in space (without recognizable objects).

16:52

The image can appear from far away but it's like looking at one of those dot paintings. When you're up close, it's a bunch of dots. And when you're far away seeing an image is possible.

There's one way to basically add some missing density in a digital point cloud

17:21

And that is to connect the points into polygons, connect them into triangles by drawing lines between the points, and then turning those lines into surfaces.

This is one way to add dimensionality to a point cloud. Another way could be to just make the points larger to basically turn them into spheres. (But that creates geometric distortions).

17:49

So let's say that you are creating a light field but we want the computer to be able to see, in the light field, what objects are. An object means, in the context of a light field, all of the points in your mental holodeck that are associated with a certain object are identified as points belonging to one object, and some other points need to be identified as points belonging to some other objects and then we need to do some object classification (semantic segmentation means doing artificial neural network classification on specific 2D or 3D points or specific 2D & 3D polygons or 2D & 3D rendered bodies) where we can say

18:32

well these points that represent this object: This is a a fire hydrant and these points that correspond to this object this is a wall and these points that correspond to this object this is a sidewalk and the points way over to my left (while my head is now pointing to the left) those points belong to an object that is a tree and what I'm doing right now, in terms of identifying, what different points are, this is semantics segmentation.

19:14

And one of the times when I tried Salvia Divinorum, which is a legal psychedelic medication that you could purchase online, there was one occasion in which I lost the ability to notice the difference between any object in the room. Basically, every object in the room including the room itself merged together into a single swirly mass that I was also part of. 

19:53

So what I'm arguing is (for our brains) that our sense of space, the sense of space, the sense of a world, is not a fundamental fact of perception. It's something that our brains learn.

# Our brains learn to divide space into different objects that have different properties.

We learned to separate the sidewalk from the window.

20:21
Reference the book "Action in Perception by Alva Noë
https://github.com/v5ma/picturesforbook/blob/main/b0081y.jpg

And if you look at basically, you know, the stories of people who have had their eyesight restored artificially after a long time, you can see that they go through a journey in which their interpretation of images develops from really weird interpretations back towards the kind of classical interpretations of visual imagery that other people report.

20:53

One person who was blind for a long time had their sight restored with modern technology (Cataract Surgery) and they went through a sort of relearning phase. This is in the book Action in Perception. So they went through this, you know, they were looking out of the window for a long time across the street and they thought they were seeing like black holes across the street.

21:30

But eventually it turned out that the black holes that that they thought looked like black holes were actually windows in another building but it took a long time for their minds to sort of go from a I guess just a really basic crude interpretation of colors in a region of space like black holes to recontextualizing that visual image to have a higher resolution pattern that demonstrated a neural tomographic graphic concept of a window in a building.

22:25

So it went from looking like a weird black hole thing to having a sharper, contrast sharper, image contrast, which was a window in another building. And this is a really good sort of improvement in their visual learning process. But it also highlights that what might be true for when human beings are first born is that there is no real distinction of space and time, no real distinction of space & time.

23:03

But over time, that newborn human being is learning to make distinctions from the stimulation that is occurring to that human being's eyes and ears, that newborn human being's eyes and ears and other senses.

So I would think that newborns are functionally blind when they first emerge from the womb.

23:38

And that the ability for a newborn to sort of like, see your eyes and your face, and react to your smile, that these are

23:55

This is not this. These are like,

24:02

Sort of like the preconditioning of reflexes. There's a lot of muscle patterns that are firing randomly and they're causing the baby to sort of make some random facial expressions. 

I remember the last time I was at a live birth, that almost immediately, it seemed like the people who were observing this newborn were projecting all of this personality and all these complex personality characteristics personality into the expressions that the baby could not possibly have any concept of what these expressions might mean to the adults around them.

24:53

It's just not plausible but people project emotions onto the faces of babies and they project interpretations as if the baby is making volitional muscle movements instead of random muscle movements.

There's a learning process through which the eye movements are going to respond to sources of stimulation at a low level.

25:32

But it doesn't mean that there's any sort of functional vision, there's any sort of functional vision happening for a newborn. So the eyes may be able to track objects. You know they can track faces that the facial expressions will begin to over time begin to copy other facial expressions, hand movements will copy hand movements, and the baby will learn to predict the patterns in the world until there's some perception of space in time and the patterns within space in time, that emerges and develops for the baby through action and perception cycle.

26:27

# The discussion is about, basically, how we computationally construct reality from the ground up.

That's what the brain is doing. I think the brain is doing. We are starting off with no conception of space and time and then we are quickly constructing a conception of space and time from the ground up, from the correlations and decorrelations of incoming sensory data.

26:54

The learned patterns that are acquired through the action and perception cycle and these learned patterns acquired through the action and perception cycle eventually take on a simulation of the universe from the human beings perspective.

In essence, each one of us is sort of simulating the universe from our own perspective, and each one of us in a sense, created our own perception of this universe, we in a sense created our own reality.

and, but that doesn't.

27:46

That is in a sense formed from the building blocks of of inner perception, inner sensation,

28:12

external perception, the link between the body of causation, which is your body, and your mouth, and your voice, the body of causation, and your fingers, and the sensory data that is giving you feedback on what the body of causation (all your muscles) is doing, and what you (your brain waves) are doing to help you put together (and render your concept of self and render)

28:55

a map of your ecosystem that you as the organism must navigate.

So our mind is like a holodeck.

The mind is in a sense creating its own rendering of space time. 

29:39

The idea is that the atom, and every oscillator in the universe, including everybody of oscillators, which includes the human body.

The human body, as a body of oscillators, is a dissipative system of oscillating dissipative systems.

Every cell is a dissipative oscillator, a dissipative system that is oscillating.

Every person is a dissipative system that's oscillating.

30:09

My argument is that every oscillator like a planet is creating space, it's creating the warping of space time around itself.

That space time is relative to oscillators at all scales from planets to atoms to galaxies that the quantity of space time emerges from, or expands from the atom.

30:50

And so my argument is not only we do we have a simulation of the universe, that we are creating from the beginning, but in a sense also, as oscillators we are creating space time, and it's as if every oscillator that ever existed across spacetime is also contributing to creating spacetime every bird, every human being, every fish is in effect, creating a node of space time.

(If life was like a blockchain, then I exist to encrypt this node of spacetime) 

31:30

And what happens when we interact with other oscillators we're visiting, itś like each person is a strange attractor in chaos theory or in the Lorenz equation the stranger attractor that is creating a node of spacetime that can interact with other nodes of spacetime.

32:07

And you are space-time interacting with space time whenever you interact with anyone else. When thinking about how all this works, it sort of takes away identity. It takes away identity in a sense that I now sort of see myself in everyone and in every life form, like, I see what I thought was me everywhere.

32:43

I mean it is kind of me but it's also not me because it's everyone I see myself in and I can't think of anything about myself other than the position, the relative position of my head.

Other than that I can't like I have if my the position of my head comes with, a sort of, I would say

33:16

If there's uniqueness to everybody, it's that everyone is a unique configuration of information, but that configuration of information is like Legos. We are made of common parts. It's like, we all have common parts. It’s like being made out of Legos, and it's like we share the same Legos but in slightly different information configurations, which amount to different physical arrangements of these lego like parts. (Legos are toy blocks that stick together & can be easily pulled apart.)

33:40

The same DNA. Letters. The same protein molecules the same nucleotide RNA sequences.

This uniqueness is sort of like the uniqueness of a neuron's position in the brain, the neuron's position in the brain and nodes that it's connected to, which are turning on and off.

34:20

So sometimes you know a neuron is connected to some neurons and sometimes it connects to other neurons. And what this neuron is connected to is

34:39

To a great extent what makes each neuron different from any other neuron is its connections. Its synaptic connections determine the neuron's receptive field (the dendrite) and its inceptive field (the branches of the exit terminal). 

When that neuron fires, it means that its perspective has been activated at that path. It’s activating it’s inceptive field (it’s Exit Terminal Connections).

35:12

That's an epic pattern and the brain has been activated and that synaptic pattern, then makes its own pattern to let the rest of the brain know that it has been activated. When that neuron makes its own pattern, it's firing pattern. That allows its perception.

35:32

It's pattern perception to link with other pattern perceptions and so, patterns link together and now they fire together. And so, basically, you have a firing sequence that represents one pattern and then represents another pattern, and then represents another pattern. And that's like a movie, right? Where a pattern can represent, you know, a pixel on a screen in a movie, or it could represent a line where we could represent a whole frame, you know, a pattern can represent a whole image frame in a movie, you know, movies.

You have heard of 24 frames per second, 30 frames per second, 60 frames per second. Movies have different possible frames per second.

36:21

Some computer monitors in 2020, We are hearing that some computer monitors are now doing 120 frames per second, or 300 frames per second. There was this NVIDIA monitor I read about that flashes at 1700 frames per second. It was a really low detail display because imagine how much computing power it would take to render VR at 1700 fps?

36:55

The more frames you have per second, the more computing power it's going, it's going to demand. So for the prototype they made it into a really low resolution 1700 frames per second.

If you increase the resolution (and the frame rate) you get more cost, more computing, greater computer requirements, greater energy costs, as you increase the speed frame rate & resolution, it costs more computing power to render each of the frames of the VR AR or Light Field experience.

37:24

We need ever increasing amounts of computing power for faster frames per second. Renderings and rendering really is like rendering is the result of a sequence of a firing that unites a bunch of independent marks into a single image that's displayed on us on some sort of surface whether that is a topological surface.

38:04

Or the functional equivalent of a topological surface and that's where I'm like, yes so people might say okay well if your brain is a Holodeck where is the topological surface? And so I'm arguing that we have basically the sparse and distributed representation of topological surfaces that amounts to the functionally equivalent of a Holodeck (in our brains).

38:49

But a Holodeck that's accomplished with sparsely coded & broadly distributed representations. It's like the neurons need only to sort of reflect a tiny piece of a pattern to combine many tiny pieces of patterns for each interval of time and each area of your receptive field to produce the functional equivalent of a Holodeck in your mind.

39:31

This can explain how dreams can be so visual and so vivid, even though you may not be getting any sensory input.

In fact, if you go into your sensory deprivation tank, where you aren't getting any light and ideally you're not hearing any sounds, the hope is that it sounds for about not every sensory deprivation tank that I've tried was a hundred percent soundproof.

40:06

But, they really can get pretty close.

So when people get into a sensory deprivation tank, the result is that they can have the experience of seeing hallucinatory images without medication and it's also possible. I mean I've had tactile hallucinations from drinking absinthe. The tactile hallucinations came on almost exactly 16 hours after drinking a couple of shots of absinthe green absinthe.

41:03

It tasted like black licorice and about 16 hours after I had tactile sensations as if there were hands all over my body and it was so amazing.

41:19

But so you could have so you could have visual hallucinations, some people have audio hallucinations.

They hear sounds that other people can't hear. They hear voices that other people can't hear. This is real, some people see hallucinations without medication. Oliver Sacks was one of those people.

41:42

He would see really cartoony, funny, weird faces and other stuff that nobody else around him could see. But this is pretty well within the range of what your brain is capable of providing, that things aren't going well in terms of your in terms of your brains health in terms of your brain function.

42:13

According to neurotypical standards.

But it can be very like it's not just neurotypical standards. There can be objective (or subjective) measures for quantifying (or defining) what disabled brain function is, in the context of some abstraction of the spectrum of human existence on this planet.

42:48

If you are unable to function as well as you know, someone who's so called neurotypical in the same settings as neurotypicals, that difference, the neurodivergent behavior can be considered a kind of disability for you in a very real way. 

I don't know if it's useful to use terms like subjective or objective here in terms of describing your experiences.

43:17

But certainly they can measure it. There are differences in your in your function compared to other people's function that could be objectively measured on tests, on your comfort levels around other people, your ability to pay attention, your ability to remember there's lots of tests that can be used to sort of try to analyze create data that we can be analyzed to sort of poke at and explore.

43:53

The differences between people who are neurodivergent in different ways whether that's autism ADHD or hundreds of other possible mental divergent situations and mental disability situations.

Someone might be hallucinating audio or visual or tactile experiences. They may even be, you know, the idea that there is one artist a friend of mine in, who lives in Alameda, not far from San Francisco and the Bay Area and she describes the way

44:39

I would have described LSD to another person the way she describes her normal perception of reality. As if her brain has basically sort of put her in a situation where she is experiencing what other people experience on LSD trip, but all the time.

45:02

She's always in a sort of visual meltdown and she has, she has basically issues related to... I don't want to go into too much detail, but she basically, you know, has a therapist to help her through her difficult moments, because her mind is in a sense.

45:37
Rendering in an alternate experience of reality, that's not neurotypical. It's neuro divergent. 

It's like imagine if you ever get to try LSD like a match, just like when you try it and you're blown away by the patterns that you see and you just have this like sort of mind expanding experience and you start to question your mind and who you are and and everything you start to think about your own cognition and really interesting ways. Just realize that some people are stuck there.

46:18

Some people don't leave that place, that perspective, that is their reality.

I have always been on the autistic spectrum and there was this great video that for my perspective, just sort of shot out of nowhere on HBO's called Temple Grandin.

https://www.hbo.com/movies/temple-grandin
“Temple Grandin”
“TV-PG | original | 1 HR 49 MIN | 2010”
“Claire Danes shines in this fact-based story of an autistic woman who became an unlikely hero to America's cattle industry--and to autistic people everywhere. This HBO Films production is an engaging portrait of a stigmatized, misunderstood young woman who learned to channel her unique gifts into a brilliant career as a scientist, author and groundbreaking animal advocate.”

46:46

Temple Grandin is an autistic person who is able to perceive patterns that go beyond the scale of the perception of reality shared by most of the neuro-typical architects that she competed with in her profession.

47:19

She was able to see that cows herds preferred to move in a circular motion pattern or in spiral like motion, she was able to intuit that this was comfortable to the cows, and she designed the cow pens to be round so the cows move in a big circle.

so if you designed the slaughter houses so cows could move in clockwise circles that meant so much to the cows.

47:54

It was so comforting for cows, to be able to walk around in a spiral versus in straight lines that it reduced cow panic, trampling, and accidental cow deaths from panic herds trampling over fallen cows.

What Temple Grandin recognized was a high level of pattern abstraction between animal comfort & animal movement that neurotypicals in her industry were not paying enough attention to naturally.

48:17

An autistic architect was the one who was able to notice this and intuit what the movement meant to the cows. So she, Temple Grandin, designed more successful enclosures for cattle that caused less herd panic.

Even slaughterhouses instead of the cows becoming frightened in trampling over each other and stepping on the one unfortunate cow that slipped.

48:48
She was able to keep the callus calmed by moving them in a clockwise circular pathway. That was soothing to the cows, biorhythms, it calmed them down when they were able to move in a circular path. 

Temple Grandin went on to suggest that autism sort of makes her perspective a little bit closer to the perspective of an animal's perspective.

And so you start to wonder, okay. Well in the evolution of human beings? Over time, the development of perspectives? How many people, you know, sort of in ancient times, would have really been on autistic spectrum and recognize the importance of moving in circular directions.

49:52

And for greater calm, for the greater column of the collective.

This is weird. Why does moving in a circular way feel beneficial to an animal, why?

Another thing that Temple Grandin did was that she designed a machine that would squeeze her sides. It would allow her to apply physical pressure to different sides of her body simultaneously.

50:20

It was a squeeze machine. She could squeeze herself in it. She found this like immense liberating calm.

Today, there are people who do something similar, where they trust their partners to tie them up with rope.

Iḿ referring to Shibari: Japanese rope bondage.

Now there is this immense tactile experience that applies pressure all over, and itś probably very calming to some people. It's probably very soothing & relaxing, but I think it's a similar concept to the squeeze machine that Temple Grandin designed for herself to be able to give herself a giant mechanical hug.

This may cause, or calm a lot of excited activity in the somatosensory cortex, via the mechanoreceptors in the skin all over. The mechanoreceptors in the skin are being activated, there is pressure being recognized by the body.

That is going to provide a strong & wide amplitude pattern perhaps that will oscillate for a long time. That might lower the noise on the brains visual patterns, and the brains audio patterns, and all the worrying thoughts

53:38

that a person might be having just because you are creating a whole bunch of tactile sensations.

I don't know exactly what the neurodynamics of a pressure based mechanical hug are but these are interesting thoughts.

With the holiday you have like we're talking pixels in your mind like visuals, but it's like these pixels wave patterns or phase patterns.

54:21

You might think of them as like the spherical pixels (of a Light Field Labs Display) but they're sort of like moving. These patterns are moving relative to your head position. So your brain is tracking where you are with grid cells and it is tracking your head position and orientation with place cells, which update a lot faster because your head position and orientation change a lot faster than the place that you're in.

54:46

Even if that place is just like a location on it, on a street or a location in the forest, you, you're in, even if you're in a car, or in some other fast living vehicle, and maybe an airplane. That would be the difference.

55:06

That would be the alternative situation, when you're moving through space really fast you're forcing your grid cells to update faster than your place cells? Which might be a little bit confusing to your brain. (Shrugs)

55:32

Yeah, so that's just something to think about.

If the government had the ability to manufacture brains in a factory, it could create its own private singularity. That would be more powerful than having a nuclear weapon.

55:57

Potentially with sentient artificial intelligence self-aware, artificial consciousness. Artificial, souls machines. Could out think human beings. If the power to make machines was in the hands of one government over the other, then that government could potentially overtake all other governments, and all other organizations. That would be like a singularity moment. In which, you know, power in the hands of one government would just exceed all others.

56:42

That government could even disintegrate. And just a few powerful individuals who have the secret, could predominate the world.

I think there is some sort of wisdom in the fact that the nuclear power was sort of like distributed from its inception that multiple countries were able to reproduce this technology. Then there is this concept called mutually assured destruction. Which means that if one country uses nukes against another country that means they could get nuked. So no wants to use nukes because that could mean suicide for the planet.

On top of that, even if you destroy just a fraction of the planet. Your personal wealth is diminished, your personal purchasing power decreases.

So if for example an entire continent is destroyed, pick any continent you want, itś not just a huge loss in terms of life, but it's a huge economic loss to global GDP, to the total annual creation of goods, products, and services. If there is less to purchase the cost of what remains goes up, and your purchasing power has decreased.

We have low costs because of the efficiencies of scale manufacturing, scaling technologies, and large scale programs that employ human labor.|

The amount that your dollar is worth is relative to the quantity & quality of things that you can buy with that dollar.

This is why Sentient & Self Aware Neural Networks will make everyone rich, because we can scale up the production of services, products, technologies, and research.
