around a chemical ball, vast networks of electro-chemical reactions, utilize electric and chemical networks predicting, adapting, balancing, and optimizing a whole ecology of electro-chemical interactions, reacting to the electromagnetic waves generated by other chemical balls in a particle space of a looping relationship between increasing complexity (including mass and dissipative systems) and increasing entropy
stars are increasing and decreasing in density, space is electromagnetic indensity
