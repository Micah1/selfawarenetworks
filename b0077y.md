So, I mean, I, I just, I prefer, like, I love neuroscience and I love computer science, and I love thinking about complex problems all day long. I love thinking it. I love discovering your concepts. I am, I am like I'm Pac-Man for concepts new concepts. Like that's what I eat.

06:34
I just like concept content content concept and I'm like a baby when it comes to new concepts. I'm just like constantly craving the next mind expanding concept and I will trip out on psychedelics and I will try to remember every last detail of my psychedelic trips and I will try to remember every last detail of my dreams and I love to interpret my dreams electro to contemplate my dreams and interpret them.

06:57
And I love to, I love to see my mind in complex, abstractions with psychedelic drugs. It's so healing and I find these immense connections. I find these. I create these immense patterns in my mind was like a delicate material. I connect the dots and and come up with really large scale, amazing patterns, when I trip out in drugs with psychedelic medication and this is the healthy.

07:32
This is, this is now known as a healthy activity, the medical community in San Francisco and Oakland and doctors at UCSF are interested in studying psychedelic medications for therapeutic benefits. This is not a scary drug. There's no reason to be afraid of psychedelic medication. If it's used in a responsible controlled and legal manner to basically heal the mind because the mind can have a lot of conflict and psychedelic medication, can be a tool for healing that doctors can prescribe for, for patients, who have severe issues?

08:19
This can really help people. So I I think that, you know, we have a lot to be happy about with psychedelic medication and, and the future of the treatment of all sorts of mental diseases. It can, it can really help with post-traumatic stress. It can help with people who are stressed out, people who are depressed.


12:16
And this changes the equation because brainwave and trainment causes your your whole brain to sync or nice with the sound over time that you're listening. So, if you're listening to like alpha brainwave and trauma, your whole mind will start to have a start to synchronize with with that alpha and trainment where your peak and at your awful way is so your brain is always has delta waves data waves, betaways gamma, waves and alpha waves.

12:50
You have all these different brain. Methods is an alpha beta theta, delta gamma and high gamma your brain always has these these different brainwave frequencies happening but they are, they're different when you're asleep. Like the that wet is dominant. And any given point in time like you will you'll have you when you're awake, when you're asleep.

13:18
There's you're gonna have a lot more if theta and a lot more delta for for certain parts of your sleep cycles, and there's a part of your sleep cycle there that has a lot of gamma, especially what I think it's, I think it's associated with what, with, when you're dreaming.

13:33
I'm gonna have to look this up before I print this, but so yeah. So if we can define, you know, a little bit of the sleep cycle in terms of different brainwave states, but then when you're awake, you're gonna have a lot more alpha. A lot more alpha waves the alpha waves are, you know, you're getting a lot of sensory activity the alpha waves.

14:00
So that so when you go from like your incoming senses to, to the two, to the two thalamus to the thalamic nuclei, and you go to the neocortex like, that area of the, of the thalamus that where the incoming. So that's the bottom half of the downness where the incoming senses come in and then the the top of the thalamus and so the bottom of analysis is going to have the bottom of the thalamus is going to be like a lot of alpha waves alpha waves to process incoming senses, right?

14:40
And then you get when you get to the thought top of the thalamus that is receiving the top of the thalamus receives the activity from the top of the of the neocortex. So the thalamus sends activity into the bottom of the, of the neocortex and then it receives activity from the top of the neocortex.

14:58
So it it the neocortex is like a black box for the thalamus. It sends in signals from one end. It receives signals from the other end. It doesn't know what's happening in the aortex. Theoretically, although it is able to in my hypothesis. I'm sorry that I described the old way of understanding that thalamus the way I see it.

15:22
The thalamus has an oscillator. It is aware of what's going on in the rest of the brain. In the, in the neocortex, it every part of the brain is aware of every part of the brain, because every part of the brain consists of oscillators and different hierarchical arrangements that are transmitting patterns with other oscillators.

15:46
And so, ultimately, every part of the brain is aware of every part of the brain. And the, but the ability for each, like the ability for each part of the brain to interpret a pattern, from another part of the brain is going to involve that each part of the brain representing the pattern.

16:08
It's receiving from another oscillator in its own way. And so from its perspective, the pattern is going to be slightly different. It's going to represent the pattern from its perspective, which might be enter in the smatter sensor. Cortex might be a much more of a textual pattern so it receives the same pattern from that.

16:29
The rest of the cortex is representing but it's going to represent. It's version of that pattern and in a textual way or a material way or a scent like a tactile sensation way because this is some addisons or cortex and you're going to have the visual cortex receiving that same pattern but it's going to represent that pattern and a visual way.

16:53
So it's going to see something is going to see the different layers that you were feeling before of some material. It's going to see the materials going to see the texture. It's going to see the shape. It's going to see the thickness and went and it works and there and but these two.

17:10
But these this man sensor cortex and visual cortex are linked together, are they they form links together in the parietal lobes. And, and so the this, the visual cortex is the occipital lobes. And the somatosensor cortex is is a is something that is going to connect to is going to send its neurons into the pry lobes towards the opposite delays so that.

17:41
So the different. So even those that matter, since your cortex and visual cortex are described as two areas, they reach toward each other and they link with one another and in terms of neural connections, so that they can share patterns. And so there's the most efficient. There's basically the most efficient neurons that it's like, heat with heaping learning, their owns that fire and close temples patient, proximity, or in terms of like, it doesn't have to be.

18:07
They could they could have temporal or spatial approximity. So if they just fire at the same time but there are different sizes of the brain. They will link together because because the each one of them is technically growing faster because it's firing faster for that moment in time when a neuron fires faster it's growing faster relative to the other neurons and it's going to grow towards the greatest source of stimulation just like a plant growing towards the sun so it's going to grow towards any other neuron that fire at the same time.

18:43
So neurons are fire at the same time even on opposite sides of the brain will technically formally link eventually because they'll start growing towards each other neurons. That are firing at the same time because at that moment in time most of the energy is coming from the other neurons that fired.

18:59
And so the neurons that are firing at that moment in time are growing at that moment in time and they're gonna grow towards the other neurons that are growing at that point in time because that's where the most stimulation is coming from just like a plant growing towards the sun, right?

19:16
So eventually and just like galaxies growing filaments towards other galaxies, right? So the galaxy is oscillating in space and that's reverberating across space. So that all of space is forming connections between galaxies. So, in a sense, space is transmitting patterns to from one planet to another, for example, with light.

19:54
So, the light just like with with fireflies. If fireflies, share light, that causes them to all enter into a common oscillation because with oscillators they are sharing each. Oscillator is, is not, is, is sending the difference of the energy that absorbed from the, from the other oscillators, when it fires so it's sending.

20:23
Like so it could fire you know, or it could not fire. So not fire is zero. It could fire as a one. It could fire really bright. That's the two. Good fire, super bright. And that's a three. And this is this is what neurosurgeon runs. Fire zero one vestical, two, vesicle or three, vesicles at other neurons.

20:49
And so those those are sacs of oil that contain neurotransmitters, that can be like in the thalamus gava in some areas, it's it's a set of Colleen and some areas, it's dopamine some areas, it's it's serotonin.

21:16
And this is going to hit other cells and it's going to stick to type of receptor on another cell that becomes a That is going to like, it's, it's basically going to Sort of like move a protein on another cell which is going to create a charge, which is going to open up another receptor.

21:54
And then nearby another receptor opens up and that starts either. It starts either receiving calcium or sodium or it starts receiving. Like it could start emitting potassium, it can start like, You know, it, but the point is and there's also chloride, but the, but the point is, that it's, it's either going to like, you're gonna have like calcium or sodium open to opening up and the sodium is, if you, you know, typically if you have a lot of the sodium opening up, what's hat.

22:33
What's happening is a lot of charges is, is building up now. So these. So, if these neurotransmitters, if they arrive faster, okay? Then they're going to start to, but put in a lot of energy really fast, right? Because they're transmitted, they're sending energy faster, but if they arrive slower, what's going to happen is, they're this because there's a one F relationship between amplitude and frequency in the brain.

23:07
What's going to happen is that these neurotransmitters are going to, they're going to basically a, you're gonna get, you're gonna get a high amplitude, low frequency burst, which is going to, which is going to, which is going to

23:36
It's gonna be like, you know, you like so I so the way I think of it, it's like, and I need to wear any work this app for some reason, I forgot how this works hanging on it. Let's see, it's, it's either. Okay, so it works like okay, so you have so a neurons spikes and then it wants to inhibit its neighbors.

24:02
So, a spike It wants to inhibit its neighbors because that's how a sparse representation is achieved in the brain. It wants to inheritance neighbors to create a spice representation. So that's that is a pattern that has that's very energy efficient but it's also a robust pattern that is is data efficient.

24:34
So it's like a really next level AI program, right? It's called like a person network. So, what you do is you is you have a lot of neurons are are sort of like considering patterns and as soon as one neuron gets it says, yes this is the pattern, it inhibits the rest of them and hit and and, and this is a so it sends that inhibition signal through through synaptic connections through.

25:08
It's external. And so it seems like the synaptic can have connections from a neuron and a layer to other neurontinous, layer are going to be inhibitory because the goal is to be like I got it and the rest of you, I need you to shut up so that this is the most efficient representation that we can make entered energetically.

25:34
So there's a lot of different neurons that could represent the pattern with the one that that comes to the conclusion first. That's the one that gets fired, so that that is the best representation for that pattern, right? And then the rest of the rest of the neurons are told to shut up, save your energy, but then the neurons then dendritic connections to the layer, too.

25:58
Must be excited to worry because it the goal. Now, to layer too, is basically to transmit the phase difference of which, which resembles the pattern which resembles how like, some sort of maybe the face difference, like might might resemble, the might symbolically represent in the in the context of memory prediction hierarchical memory, production like momentous time at heart when that memory protection or just or another.

26:34
Another way to to actually honestly talk about this is to call it predictive coding. This is also pretty good coding. This is also heavy and learning but predictive coding like the like, the predictive coding is like seeing is like putting a lens on and seeing in terms of like I'm a machine is trying to predict something and it's forming patterns because it's trying to put each part of itself is trying to predict when it's going to fire.

27:04
So now it's going to watch all the other neurons to predict when it's going to fire. That is just that is a way of understanding, he being learning, that's a perspective on it. So it's like a memory, it means that memories. So a neuron is going to the way it fires each time.

27:23
It is going to sort of define how it becomes. Aligned how it how it, how changes to its structure are made. And what, which of its synaptic connections are going to be active, which are going to be deactive in activated, which are going to be inhibited, and which are going to be removed.

27:45
That's what I meant by deactivated, which you're going to be where our new ones were a new connections, new synaptic connections going to be formed. And so, as as it makes these synaptic connections, then each of the nodes is effectively differentiated from other nodes. So each of the nodes effectively represents different patterns, different sets of patterns because it's it's going to be different in terms of it's placement in the graph.

28:14
And in terms of which connections it has to which other neurons. And the kind of weird thing is that any neuron? It can be like within six hits of any other neuron like they can bait. Like basically, they can sort of form like a cat, like, from from a, an initially chaotic organization.

28:34
There aren't like the connection between ours, could be completely random. And from that initially chaotic organization, there's really like a short hops between any two neurons in the brain and then eventually, eventually they can just form direct connections because they can just grow, grant dendrites between them bypassing, whatever is in between them.

28:55
So, so the idea is that, you know, any signal can travel quickly to any neuron that's not connected to and that could be a signal to connect. And so then really quickly neurons could form connect direct connections and that but that would be like maybe something that would happen after a lot of firing over time.

29:20
So that means like a pat like if you learned if you walked down the same street every day and you see the same thing things eventually, you really get to know the world that you're that you're in. Eventually you really get to appreciate the intense details of the place that you're in, because you're just your mind, just like that pattern is happening over and over again.

29:51
And so those patterns are becoming more intensely ingrained in how your brain is connected together. And so you build memories on top of place. And, and that's part of why shifting to, that's why part of like moving to another city, you know, for the first day or first, two days, it has the first week you're just not, you're just out of it, you're just completely tired.

30:20
Moving to a new city is just this sort of like thing that is going to cause your brain to have to make a lot of new connections. That is like a ton of noise to to initially start to process. And in turn reshape the noise of your first moments in a new city into something that where your brain is.

30:50
Like just, you know, feeling like you like you, like you like you are just part of the city now. And now, like even like, you know, people will like, ask you, like, two weeks like somehow two, some had tourists know that you, like you belong there that you that you that's your city.

31:12
Like the, you know, things about that city and the like regard you as an expert just based on how you look somehow like like somehow they know, right? Like, oh, that's a San Francisco person that person lives in San Francisco. He knows anything. I can ask him anything about San Francisco.

31:27
He knows it. Like, they just know that based upon a meeting you that. Oh my god, this is an expert. I can talk to this expert. They live here or something. Like, how do you know that? How do you know, how do you know that that's just? Like, like, what is it about me?

31:41
That looks like San Francisco. I don't know. I just live here but other people see it, right? And and okay, you know, it's like, um, I am here so much that I I I I start to wonder if the world outside of San Francisco, actually still exists. You know, these could be implanted memories.

32:09
I mean isn't like the movie of the matrix takes place in San Francisco, right? Like how do I really know? There's I'm just this is all just humor. Of course I am looking forward to seeing the matrix at the time that I'm writing this, I then matrix resurrections film is what I mean, the fourth film in the, the sequence of of films for this movie, I am

32:43
I, you know, I I, you know, there's so much to say that the matrix represents the, their mind and the the human world that we met in the second film, at that represents the the body and or the, you know what, there's no, there are no ads, there's no advertisements in the in the in the world of the physical, right?

33:12
The world of that's home without any advertisements. That was that without quote, corporations without logos. That is just another

33:32
Yeah, that's just another and another sort of experience and and then there's there's this world that's like, you know, sort of like the underworld is sort of like I sort of like how and it's like people are just really wearing goddly lots of goth gear like oh, that's oh yes.

33:56
That we have that in San Francisco. There's there's definitely like golf clubs and stuff or people wear people wear a gas mask. Like there's a sort of pandemic that's gonna happen someday. And then, of course, yeah, we did have a pandemic, of course. And everybody's like yes I already have my gas mask.

34:09
There's so there's that, and
34:22
So, we have to, like,
34:36
I have to definitely say that, you know, the the matrix is basically like an entire city that is just in the mind and a matrix is like a collective, it's like a collective mind, right? But there's no reason why like you think of it thing, you think of it also is like the matrix is everyone has their own matrix, simulation in their mind, like everyone is simulating the entire cosmos.
35:01
That is that is one of the simulations of the cosmos that is one of the instances of the cosmos. That's what I'm saying because we are oscillators. We're creating a space around ourselves electromagnetically. Like we're shaping space. The planet is shaping space, but the planet is an oscillator. Every atom is shaping space, the dimension of space exists because of oscillators and oscillators are when they combine, when authors combine they fuse, they become like, infused object.

35:36
They they are in effect acting as if they refuse to object, when they start oscillating together. So when oscillators combine and start awesome together and large groups, they exert a multiplied, force space. Expands much more when oscillators are multiplying together. They are they're almost pushing each other apart, right?

36:03
In terms of like imagine, like the different galaxies are almost pushing each other apart. Even the, even as they're growing towards each other, in terms of, you know, having filaments that are connecting between each other. But they're almost pushing each other apart at the same time at their sending signals to one another and when this happens with groups of fireflies neuront that fireflies, you know when they first you know get up, get up and they start moving around.

36:29
They're all firing at different firing rates in this chaotic, there's no sinking but very quickly. They start to, you know, one fires and then that sets a sort of like the decay rate of the one that fired sort of sets, the firing rate of it's it. I mean, I mean, I actually, I mean, might be a messing up missing us up.

36:47
There's I think there's more than one theory about how firefly firing works and that might be that right? Also be like different different different ways at this process happens in different species. So I so yeah. I I'm actually forgetting how this works but this is a lot of this comes from the book sink if you.

37:12
So, if you want to read more about fireflies and sinking, I read the booksink and that taught me so much about you know what it means when and that neurons are oscillators. And that, then the whole brain is oscillating. It's a chaotic, chaotic oscillation like that. Like the book sync, really helps me understand that the computations of, of oscillations and that informed, the self-orients book.

37:46
But but what's really interesting is that so when we without with hat with inhibition, and we have basically a sparse pattern, but the inhibition also shapes, the, the image received by the next array, right? So is, if is, if the whole layer, one cortex is passing image to layer two cortex, okay?

38:09
Then then the firing patterns of tonic firing inhibited, firing phasic, firing and high phase expiring are basically going to define a an image for another array in the brain to perceive just like the, the eyes are basically an array, just like the nose. Just basically, a sensor array. Just like your hands basically have are your skin is basically a sensor array and your, your you're nostrils, the hairs and your nostrils and hairs in your ears are basically center arrays.

38:51
Like, like, you are basically all yours, all your senses are sensor arrays or raise of senses sensors, or raise a sensors, and these sensors are also transmitters. So, these sensors will receive your your brainwaves. I mean, so these centers were received. I'm sorry. Face changes, right? Because remember neurons are transferring their transferring waves of chemicals waves of chemicals and and possibly magnetic waves, electronic field, waves, magnetic field, waves and soliton mechanical waves, and there's also chemical ways, right?

39:49
So those are those are four different kinds of ways. So there's the there's like as a friend of mine called it. There's the, the ion on topic brain, there's the metallic brain, but you know, in a way you could think of it as there's, there's magnetic brain. Electronic brain mechanical soluton, mechanical wave brain and that include in the mechanic wave brain is also includes the acoustic brain or audio brain.

40:18
And then there's also a potentially a chemical waveframe, which is, you know, chemical waves is just a whole other area of research that I know very little about. But it's very, it's very interesting that you have basically four ways of four ways, in which the brain could be simultaneously conscious right?

40:42
You could have basically, basically, you have all those groups of waves are patterns, being transmitted between oscillators that are sensitive to those patterns and therefore data can be collected and constructed in all four of those ways. And that is those are like there's like we have force of war networks happening in the brain.

41:05
Simultaneously. Innocence, We have four brands.
