array node

glutamate receptor thresholds, dendrite branch thresholds, allows for precise detection of partial patterns over time so that a unique pattern completion a detect based on the branches of inputs at each level of the networked sensor, and when they all light up its like saying this pattern is remembered to the rest of the network, represented by the connections in the exit terminal.

receptor thresholds, dendrite & soma thresholds, then the sensor fires when its learned representation is recognized,
