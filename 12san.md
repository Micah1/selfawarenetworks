There is a lot that we can add, and change, I've included a couple of suggestions in this email, but it might be best to focus on minimal changes for now and just getting the paper published and out. After it's published we could make a second edition of the paper, and a third, or a new paper on a topic that branches out from this topic and focuses some particular aspect in more detail. You can think of this as just the start of what will become a much larger body of work over time, that will include revisions and new features in the future. (like computer simulations, experiments, predictions, mathematics, and reviews of similar theories for cross-reference and clarification of differences)

1. I would say we should modify the part about non-dualism to explain how it connects to the NAPOT concept, specifically how the phase wave different helps craft the entities inside consciousness and how what handles those entities are the tonic oscillations of different cell bodies like the cortical columns for example. Thus the Non-linear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA) of Cell bodies, like cortical columns is the canvas of consciousness. The Phase Wave Differentials are the Ink of Qualia that modifies that canvas temporarily. Then relate this back to the non-dualist concept of the Ground of Being, the cloud of formlessness in which forms arise (qualia or rendered internal representations.

2. There are other things we could change about the paper like that such as emphasizing Neural Rendering
“Neural Rendering” as a Core Mechanism
The SAN framework focuses heavily on neural rendering, especially how predictive coding and oscillatory feedback loops create internal models. Your section on imagination would benefit from:

Discussing rendering canvases as described in SAN—the analogs of raster scan lines across "the tonic oscillating brainwave patterns" within cortical columns.

Describing mental taxis and active memory as layered rendering engines that organize internal and external sensory schematics.

Point 1:
Non-Dualism, NAPOT, and the Canvas of Consciousness
Non-Dualists believe that conscious awareness is aware of itself. You are aware of yourself. To be self-aware creates a necessary subject-object duality, with conscious awareness being both the subject and the object. Once this duality exists, then there can be experiencers and experiences, perceivers and perceptions, thinkers and thoughts.

To further elaborate within the Self Aware Networks (SAN) framework, the arising of this duality can be understood through the principles of Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT). Within NAPOT, the phase wave differentials—rapid, high-frequency but low-magnitude excitatory oscillations—form transient informational "imprints" upon the tonic oscillations of cortical columns and other neural ensembles. These tonic, lower-frequency, higher-magnitude rhythms act as a substrate or carrier wave, analogous to what non-dualism calls the Ground of Being.

The canvas of consciousness in this model is the Non-linear Differential Continuous Approximation (NDCA) of these oscillating cell bodies—especially cortical columns—which maintain stable local field potentials across time. These cortical columns serve as computational surfaces upon which patterns of excitatory synchrony are rendered, much like raster scans across a mental screen.

In this framework:

Tonic oscillations = the canvas (Ground of Being)

Phasic wave differentials = the ink (Qualia as dynamic perturbations)

NDCA = the mathematical approximation of how these cortical manifolds continuously evolve over time to hold and integrate phase information

Hence, forms (qualia) arise within formlessness (tonic oscillatory canvas) and are sculpted by phase-differentials traveling through hierarchical neural arrays. This offers a precise neural-correlate-based account of non-dualist metaphysics: consciousness as oscillatory modulation within a formless yet stable ground.

Point 2:
Neural Rendering as Core Mechanism of Mind and Imagination
Imaginative memory is comprised of compartmentalized mental canvases on which specialized mechanisms create two or three dimensional animations. A canvas has an arrangement of elements called a taxis... Objects from perception can be used to construct scenes and animations in imaginative memory.

To deepen this architectural framework, we emphasize that the SAN model identifies Neural Rendering as a foundational mechanism by which perception, imagination, and cognition are unified. Within cortical columns, the tonic oscillations of local field potentials create stable, low-frequency attractor basins—akin to a mental rendering substrate—while incoming or internally generated phasic bursts represent high-frequency pattern imprints over that substrate.

This system behaves analogously to raster scan lines, where rendering proceeds across a spatially and temporally synchronized network of cortical loops. The mental taxis serve as structured addresses or references to scene layers, mesh configurations, and sensory embeddings. These taxis are rendered across the oscillatory substrate using mechanisms akin to the predictive coding and re-entrant feedback loops you describe in Section 3.

Additionally:

Active memory behaves like a dynamic render queue, organizing which perceptual or ontological elements are "in view" depending on temporal proximity, valence, and functional relevance.

Scene reconstruction in imaginative memory is not merely symbolic, but is oscillatory and geometric, grounded in SAN's concept of hierarchical phase alignment across thalamocortical and corticocortical feedback loops.

Thus, neural rendering is the unified computational process by which layered perceptual schematics (e.g., phonemes, geons, objects) are bound into 3D internal simulations that can be replayed, mutated, or imagined. This process occurs through phase wave propagation and dynamic taxis referencing, consistent with NAPOT and NDCA principles.
