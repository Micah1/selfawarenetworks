The experiences of redness and or the Standard A Tones are differentials in the phase pattern (between the inhibited, the tonic baseline brainwave activity, the phasic & high phasic bursts.) 

Expanded: The experience of redness, and or the experience of the Standard A Tone is a difference in a phase pattern (That can range from the tonic baseline state, a phasic burst (maybe this is comparable to a Plateau frequency, to a high phasic burst, or the inhibited state.

The phase wave (its frequency & magnitude) pattern differential embodies properties representative of that pattern (a red color or a Standard A tone). The phase differentials representing Redness and or the Standard Tones would be detected by dendrites, and re-rendered by exit terminals for other arrays, and entified in your mind via temporal & spatial oscillation.

Brocoli Properties example: All the properties of Brocoli are features learned by the neural network of the human brain. So the color, texture, feel, crunch, taste, smell these are learned patterns, information patterns are detected as coincidence evens by receptors on dendrites, then by neurons, then by arrays of neurons, then by nuclei in the thalamus, then by cortical columns & the hippocampal entorhinal circuit, then by the thalamus again, essentially circuiting throughout your brain in a spatial temporal oscillating feedback loop.

"When the researchers tested the animals’ memory of this new skill weeks later, they found that those mice that still remembered the skill showed increased activity in the same neurons that were first identified during the learning period, showing that these neurons were responsible for encoding the skill: the researchers had observed the formation of memory engrams."
"Motor cortex engram cells took on new synaptic inputs — "
"It was the first time anyone had observed the creation of new synaptic pathways on the same neuron population — both at the input and the output levels — in these two brain regions."

The point of the Brocoli Properties example was to show that if we could intercept at the Thalamus how the properties of Brocoli are signals being passed to the neo cortex, then we could recreate the experience of Brocoli in the Thalamus by creating that set of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes. This could be done at any point in the brain, or on any part of the body, as illustrated in the example of the tongue strip with a grid of electrical signals that correspond to the pixel changes of a camera's viewfinder, a device that allows people to see through their tongue or via any part of their body.

David Eagleman talks about this and he talks about the experiment of pulling a rats eyeball out and plugging it into the auditory cortex, and the rat learning to see. Eagleman then goes on to speculate that human brains could be plugged directly into abstract data sets like Nasdaq Exchange data, and they would begin to make useful representations and predictions about that data, because every part of the brain is a general or generic learning system, or is otherwise capable of handling a broad spectrum of sensor modalities, which might be different from one another in terms of what part of the frequency spectrum they persist in.

but what is special about the thalamus, beyond the concept of the thalamus being a router for information from the senses to the cortex, is that it is one of the intersections in the brain where signals from different senses come together, there are other major intersections of course, like the Parietal Temporal Junction, but what is even more special about the thalamus is that signals leave the thalamus to enter the neocortex, travel up the layers of the cortical columns and then return to the thalamus, so the thalamus is the alpha and the omega of brain signals, the beginning and the end of a feedback loop, the biggest feedback loop perhaps. (I will have to study further to make sure)

There are papers that suggest the hippocampus is like a cortical column, and or a comparator to cortical column data, maybe its cortical column #1, and maybe that is where the base rendering of consciousness begins, or likes to sit, like the central locus of focus, but the information in just the hippocampal-enthorhinal loop might be like you, the room, the walls, and where you are in the world, and following the book A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins it might be true that each of your other cortical columns gets busy representing other objects, sounds, concepts, and things that are part of your experience in the room, so the cup on the table, and the hot sauce, are each managed by different cortical columns, all the properties of the cup might be sent to a cortical column that is managing the sensory integration for that object, its orientation, position, temperature, texture, sound etc... and when your awareness of that cup increase that is plausibly going to be an increase in the syncronization between that cortical column and the hippocampal entorhinal loop & the parietal temperal junction all at once, this is something we could look for with current medical imaging technology, whether there is brainwave frequency synchronization between hippocampal frequencies and the parietal temporal junction and or specific cortical columns.

The main idea that I have about the importance of brainwave synchrony between brain regions when objects become conscious comes from thinking about Tim Mullen's neuropype, and how he aligned unstructure data like EEG, EMG, ECG (Brain, Muscle, Heart sensors) by understanding the assumptions made in each technology and figuring out how to correctly align the signal differences temporally, so that when a brainwave spikes, one might associate it with a heart rate spike, given a time based association.

In the same way if one part of the brain wants to understand unstructured data from another part of the brain, I suspect synchrony (achieved by listening to one's self) is creating a temporal alignment between two oscillators so that correlations between the two sets of unstructured data can be found by the neural network of your mind, and you make sense out of an association between lightning & thunder for example.

So if we knew how the properties of brocoli were represented by scanning them at the Thalamus at the moment you were thinking about them, then we might identify which cortical column is managing those properties when you are not thinking about them, and even if you have a completely different personality that manages brocoli in a different region of the cortex, by stimulating the thalamus with the properties of brocoli that we learned from watching your thalamus we might trigger the experience of brocoli in your brain, we might have a next generation brain computer interface for bringing Augmented Reality & Virtual Reality experiences not through glasses but through direct brain stimulation, to recreate known patterns.
