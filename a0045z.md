A thousand brains theory, when I spoke to Jeff Hawkins I asked him if a thousand brains was distributed like a hologram, he said no, the idea is that variations of the same patterns occur in different cortical columns.

The Holographic Universe book explains that
Once upon a time people thought that memories had specific locations, or engrams
The idea that memories are distributed in multiple places 

What if the government divided everyone up into two groups. 1. Those who fight in the military, who are taught obedience and sacrifice, and 2. Those who live in the civilian world and just fight 

The firing of the action potential is a vector line of electrical charge producing a change in the magnetic field that corresponds to and ripples from an imaginary vector that runs through the center of the axon from the soma to the exit terminals. What I imagine is that it dissipates through the notes of ranvier also, and dissipates into fractions of its original branches as its wave is divided by the many axon terminals

So this means that a row of neurons is exhibiting a magnetic phase pattern that is driven by the electric movement of the AP.

With each large phasic charge dissipativing the surrounding area a pattern is selected by the brain, and magnified by the brain to the next area to look at, so its like each area is helping to decode, encode, resolve some part of a pattern, so that each layer is noticing another part of the feature, at another scale.

Specifically that's how the magnetic patterns are transmitted via the electrical conductance
so the ionic gradient itself represents one form of memory, it is storing one of the representations of the magnetic phase field, but there are also mechanical acoustic vibrations, chemical waves, and the electrical brainwaves which electrical charge is generated by neurons, and then it is dissipated again in the axon terminal turned into mechanical motion, magnetism, chemical, and heat (expanding cell membrane is heat traveling directionally but also radially.) there is similarly a drop in heat with the neurons that just fired
