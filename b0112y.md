Okay, so the next step is that I am going to listen to transcripts So that. So the next step is that I'm gonna listen to the transcripts or I'm gonna read the transcripts as I'm like, listening through the audio recordings, right? And then while I'm listening, basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to paste the transcripts into a note so I can edit the errors while I'm listening to them and the pace in select the the relevant portions of the notes that are going to fit into the book.

00:34

So I'm just going to start to slot them into the book under the topics that exist already. So even though, like the topics are not completely outline, number start sliding stuff in and this sort of fits in with the vision. Like, yeah, I can keep adding stuff to the table adding and subtracting stuff from the table of contents.

00:51

But basically, I can begin to fill in the sections of the book with the content that I have so far. And that will help me sort of like, figure out how I need to grow and expand the table of contents, even more. So I'm basically creating a workflow where I'm, I developed like a prototype of the table of contents.

01:11

Now that I've done that it's not like it's not complete and I understand why I feel like it's it's it's been hard to complete it. It's been hard to do a complete table of contents, because because I have too many concepts to go over, but what will happen, I think, if I follow this process of, okay?

01:36

Now, let me just listen to the content that I have and make a new note with it. And begin to like slot in, you know, content by topics into the chapters that are designed for those topics. What will happen is that I will think of new sort of things to add to the table of content that will come from like, right now.

02:00

I think I'm hitting a wall and adding to the table of contents because I have like five or six different tables of contents and five different places. And the each included like a ton of different topics and their reference, a ton of different materials. But right now, what I ought to do is go through my existing stack systematically so that I can pull out content and begin to arrange it in the chapters that I have decided, I need to have, because I have like, said, okay, I need a chapter about this.

02:42

I need to chapter about that but I haven't done all the chapters because part of the development of the chapters sort of needs me any that the development of the chapters is needs to sort of like be flexible. So some of the content has to some the, it's like, it's like this, the chapters represent the synaptic structure.

03:12

If the brain a synaptic memory structure, and a fractal sense, like chapters are like, and I guess that could represent the court, the cortical column, you know, quite sort of cortical columns could be fractal of the, the synapses on the, on the, on the on, again, unidentight, like the blue times on the dead rate, right?

03:43

Like I guess it's the what I'm saying is like so if you imagine like this. So the cortical columns are like analogous to boutons, right? And with the point being that like, they are,

04:05

You can see them as like, basically able to, the able to play back memories because of their firing sequences. So the firing sequence of of the synapse by itself is like playing back memories where it's like playing. It's like playing a memory to a cell but then idea is that the cell is going to play back that memory and we're that configuration.

04:46

It's going to play like so there's a synaptic configuration and then it gets played, right? Like a piano being played. So it produces and information, caring ways. A lot of time that is and the shape of which is defined by that by the arrangement of the Botox.

05:16

And but in a similar sense, like the arrange. So, the arrangement of the cortical, columns, sort of, if that, if you could consider that the code, the active, the active, our components of a cortical column as being like, the, the changes in what's active in terms of of the, the bhutons of the activity sequence of bhutons of bhutons, that that words be the basis of memory for the, for the here, for long-term potentiation, like you could say that.

06:11

So basically at a larger scale like the the firing inside cortical columns at the hermetal scale, I'm sure at the at the parameter level the perimeter cell level, the fit, the sixth layer of the fifth or sixth layer of the neocortex, where the pyramidal cells are connecting to. They're helping to connect the cortical columns together, right?

06:42

And I like to compare it to the analogy of like the retina on the inside of your eyeball, because I'm because they're both, it's like it's like a nervous system wrapped around the interior of of a sphere or half dome. All right. If you like that's that's what that's why they're the.

07:09

You can see the retina wraps around the inside of your spherical eyeball about. But not not they not for the entire sphere but just, you know, there's a, you know, you just for like the I think it's just the back half. I don't know how. I don't know the exact the exactly.

07:32

So the exact concern surface area of the right now but that'd be good to look up for. Yes. So then you have like, you know, the neocortex is not the

07:49

Is not the entire brain, but it's like the top two thirds. It's like 90% of your of your of your brain.

08:07

Well, at least it's at least the top two thirds I have to gosh why am I the confused about that? I need to look it up but and so the pattern complexity of the of all the different modality representations combined. So if you can represent the feeling of touch, if the feeling of wet water filling at a hard surface, feeling of a rough surface, soft surface like different kinds of feelings.

08:39

When you have all these different patterns and you can see bricks and you know how bricks feel and you can, you know, how bricks sound and you can see, you know, the ground and the asphalt, the concrete, the trees, the dirt, and you have all these different sensory modalities in your, from the Sonata sensory cortex.

09:00

The visual cortex in the audio cortex when you're focusing on something when you're aware of it, in a way that combines, most of all sensory realities together that it's got, that's going to probably light up, your temporal parietal. Sorry. You're yeah, your temporal prior junction, which is associated with attention with associated with.

09:27

That's the, that's a part of your brain that lights up. It's like convergence point between the three, primary sensory, quarters use, and so there's activity. Now, if there's coordinated activity in all of them, it does make sense that given it. It's location and in the brain, like, you know, like that energy is going to be flowing towards it.

09:51

Like, like, I'm just like, yeah, imagining that electromagnetic energy would converge there, not only because it's in the center, but precisely because it's in a center. It's like an average points between the three areas. And so it is a natural conversions point in a physical way. Like in, you know, I don't know how much electromagnetism would would sort of bounce off the interior, surface of the human skull and back, sort of like, converge back towards the center of the brain, or towards the temporal final junction which is what lights up when you're paying attention to something.

10:37

But it's an interesting idea. It's sort of like the idea that the, that the, the funny idea that the camera of these actually concentrates because of the, the, the dimensions of a tetrahedron that they might reflect electromagnetic energy back towards the center of the parent and also beneath the permits and which is like, you know, it like for like, second for second.

11:08

You're like, well, So could the parameter keys are basically function, like a spaceship, All right? If it's basically able to concentrate, it's it's like a really slow spaceship, Like what if it's able to like, like sort of concentrate or reflect electromagnetic energy back towards a focal point. The same way, it doesn't work right?

11:36

Like all these plates or satellite dish. Then yeah. Then like what are the potential reasons why someone would would would do that or use that technology? Like, maybe they are imagining, they would create a spaceship or something when they built it. Yeah, we're gonna we're gonna, this is gonna be like a rock and then and then the guy who, what who's building this spaceship, the pyramid of Giza, maybe he, he wasn't.

12:08

Maybe he died before he did before, he could tell other people how this space actually works. And so, instead of launching him into space, they just buried him in it, right? And that like and like, and then they be and then, like, so people, like forgot that it was supposed to be a spaceship when I built it.

12:30

One that probably didn't have enough thrust and because the physics of a flight hadn't been figured out. And so they forgot that it was a spaceship and they just said, oh no this was a tomb. It was a tomb for a great king, right? And and that wasn't the original intention.

12:53

Maybe. Maybe they wanted the spaceship, so I don't know, it's really silly but like that would require you know them to have like an understanding of electron magnetism which which doesn't seem likely or plausible at all. I think it's more likely that they like pyramid shapes and that need permissions for easier to build.

13:14

And it's probably a simple and it's probably coincidental that it reflects electromagnetism back towards the center. Yeah. But it's interesting idea that your brain might kind of do that just like to school because it's a sphere. It like it might increase but be the the chances that electromagnetic energy bounces back towards the center of your brain.

13:45

You know, just sort of if you're skull lake is kind of at all reflected here, electromagnetic spacefield. I'm not sure that it is or is it actually? That's an interesting question to research later on but I what I like I suspect that is a second that could be a second reason for why the temporal parietal junction lights up when we're paying attention because I guess logically when we're paying attention something, maybe maybe our brain activities is picking up especially especially in certain areas, you know.

14:28

So some activities is happening. And and so, I mean, the physics being a central location and electromagnetic network is, Is something I like to know even a lot more more about, but right, not necessarily something. I need to cover in this book. So for another, for another, another book,
