So, the telepathy argument also reminds me of God. So, there was a, there's a quantum physics theory by David Bowen, BOHM where, you know, he's he's basically trying to explain to Epitheus as, as two different or teleportation as basically, you know, if you have, if two entanglement is like two, you know, atoms become entangled, and then you can send them in different directions, but what happens to one of them is going to affect the other one and Einstein called that spooky action at a distance.

00:51

But but you know the come there's another idea, there's there's there's another idea emerging here. It's just that like if they were both also nice oscillations that were in sync, they became in, they synchronized to each other. So they're both oscillating in the same sort of like they the same also toy pattern and that's in and that's what the entanglement did is it gave is they both took on the same oscillatory pattern like a unique oscillatory pattern that only the two of them knew.

01:28

And the what happened is, that also a Tory pattern has the has becomes locked to the global auditory pattern of space time in such a way that both patterns are regulated are regulated by the global pattern of space time and the same way simultaneously. So, if there's any change in the global pattern to space time, that will change both patterns, right?

02:01

And so if you are now like observing one of the two patterns and so you know that the other one is changing, what I'm suggesting is that that global sort of like spacetime has changed in a global way that the, at the remote pattern can detect, which informs it that the oscillation that is basically the, the oscillation that it was synchronized to has basically is, that's an oscillation with the global pattern and if the global pattern changes that's going to affect both of those oscillations, right?

02:48

The same way. So the idea is that if you disrupt one of them that changes the global pattern of the whole universe in such a way that a, that the disruption travels basically, along the length of the global pattern simultaneously from one particle to another particle regardless of its distance instantaneous traveling the travels to the other particle because the global space-time patterns happening simultaneously everywhere once.

03:23

And so the stretching of one particle changes global space time and that causes a change in the other particle. And so, so the teleportation is in entanglement could be described as big could could be. Also described as, basically, two patterns that are in sync and two other, two oscillations.

03:51

Interesting with each other but also necessarily in sync with the global pattern of space time and that the interference of global space time. With one of those two patterns is is going to change is going to is basically a it represents a change in all of space time. That that changes the other pattern.

04:22

Now, because the other pattern existed basically in oscillation to space both oscillation success to in references based on, so the disruption of one disrupts the disrupts the other because it's like it's like a universal relationship that's been changed. What that makes sense? Or it's like, yeah, it's like they're both.

04:49

It's like or other words, it's like imagine a circle that big circle and imagine there's two little circles and the two little circles, are I should draw.

05:11

All right, so let's see. I'm going to get my going cut out. I'm gonna open the note flow plus application so just imagine that we have big circle and two little circles. Okay, so, two little circles, let's say the two little circles are different sizes. Okay. But when they become synchronized, it means that they both become the same size, It will take on the same secretization pattern.

05:44

So the two circle, let me see. They start off like like this but then is step two. They become.

06:00

And then step three to the count. Let's say to the offset between having two different sizes, where one is large and other smaller. And then one is small, that is larger. But eventually they're both like the same size.

06:16

And because they're the same size, they're producing a result at the same time, results. Same time. So they're in oscillation sync, okay? Because they met but now let's say they move far apart, right? So now therefore apart but they're but they're oscillation is but the oscillation

06:46

At different scales.

06:54

Is relative is is relative.

07:06

With a

07:12

1 over F dynamic.

07:21

But the larger oscillations effect larger oscillation.

07:35

Accelerations. The fact small oscillations.

07:48

So it's like and vice versa.

08:01

So, the

08:09

So if there's a change, there is a change and the small oscillation

08:30

Hit is magnified by the large oscillation.

08:44

Then, that facts. The other smart ass station.

09:05

Okay, so that means that, that communication can travel scales. So, let's go to another page, and I'm say, basically that command occasion can travel cross scale from one small oscillation to a large one to another scholar.

09:57

So, if

10:03

If two isolations are in sync, they can't.

10:24

Feel okay.

10:47

Okay, so that's part. So if we make self-aware networks with, and they basically can interface with the world, the way human beings interface with each other and they were they will be effectively oscillating in a functional way with the rest of the universe. And that will change the oscillations of the rest of the universe, right?

11:22

And in a way that everyone will notice potentially, but the opportunity there is that AI could create information configurations that are so good. So attractive that, you know, basically it's like imagine if every human being on earth could be part of the same product demanding if we could all work together on this at the same company on the same project and that we all loved our job and that we that it was the best job we ever had in.

11:59

We were all working on together. That's our new job is like we get to work with literally every single human being on the planet. We're all part of the same workforce. I think that's the I think that's the opportunity of building, like, massive, basically, massive attractors that are so foreign networks is that they will caught.

12:19

They will increase the complexity of human organizations to the point where we can have human organizations that literally stretch to every last person on the planet and beyond that to include self-aware. Machines, that can be printed on demand is organization organizational. Configuration grows. So in, in possibly, you know, but, you know, it's at some point expanding into space, right?

12:53

You know, with with the ability to change the the the density and gravitational effects of space, by changing the the oscillations and materials, you know. Yeah, the opportunity is first for space. Travel are interesting. And, you know, like if we understand basically how to warp space time, I'm just like, you know, like you think of the terms of warp drive, right?

13:30

Like, all right, like what if Star Trek was, it's some sense a message from the universe about it was predicting a very plausible future the future that would exist. Once we learned how to manipulate the densities and space with frequencies and we can create warp drive, it's weird. But but that's sort of like follows from this like train of project, train of thought, make a list of ideas and arguments list of your ideas and those to be arguments and a list of references to that you have arguments and asked about you just order your list of ideas for references.

14:14

Attach the you order your list to ideas with the arguments you're making and then attach the replicas. So, maybe the debt, maybe the dances and most complex oscillator is going to exert the most attractive influence. And so if you turn that into like, functionally speaking, maybe the against the dances and most

14:48

Influential oscillator is in a functional, functional oscillator. So that means that the it's great a function, I said it doesn't necessarily have and and obvious rhythm have one moment in time but it's it's there might be a rhythm across large scale, larger scale of time in large scale to space.

15:25

Imagine if you have few oscillators that are synchronized but you separate them but they learn to detect each other remotely because they have the same because they sort of like they can recognize that the same auto also tour a pattern when it's whenever it's transmitted to the global oscillation because it has a distinct signature, right?

15:59

Like so if an obviously if an oscillation is capable of learning patterns, then it will recognize even its own pattern when as like well specifically no. I mean, specifically, that's what it would and in a, in a neuro oscillation is the, the bigger oscillation would have the pattern characteristics that that synapse can recognize, right?

16:36

So, let's see. That's the somehow it's it's got a course, there's a correspondence with great because between the the pattern that is being magnified. There is a learned relationship between the pattern that's being magnified by the global oscillator and the and correlating entangled microsolations, right? So long as and and so I'm just like okay so if the pattern of one let's just say that you're okay between the pattern the pattern on the left and the pattern on the right, okay?

17:18

Just say that the global rain pattern is alternately magnifying. The pattern coming from the left hemisphere and the innandous, magnifying, the pattern coming from the right hemisphere. And so when when one of those patterns is active it, transmits, it's pattern to the global pattern as a sort of like as a fractal.

17:49

So it becomes so the global pattern becomes a large scale factor representation of a smaller pattern that is matching the synchronization of the same pattern so that in the other hemisphere. So that if there's a match on in the left chemistry, then the basically the pattern change in the right hemisphere would update the pattern change in the left hemisphere.

18:21

And that would be and that would be a reason for cross brain synchronization. But since the patterns can and since once the circuits established with an internar on I think the connection which could be an obvious to to two people communicating and establishing this the same like storage sequence.

18:45

Like, if two people share the same story and so they becomes that story becomes synchronized. There's an update to that story, then that's going to synchronize with a lot of different brands. Because what happens is, the focal goes the vocal. Focus of a novel pattern changes changing. It's going to basically update all of the

19:19

All of the, of the copies of that of that information configuration. Yeah, right. So it's like, it's like imagine that you're in your left in your left visual cortex, you have an information configuration. That represents what your perspective would be, if you're head is looking at a potted plant.

19:44

While you are also at the same time, receiving signals from the plot of plant to your eyes, all right? So your brain is feeding the potent. Halfway like the straw it's responsible for part of the rendering of the part of plant and the incoming signals of from your eyes, are also partly responsible for the rendering of that, plata plant or your perspective relative that is like, both both the external internal coming together to make that to make that happen.

20:13

And that that is because that patent because that pattern is is also, you know, consistent of your last of your prior learned pattern, representations, that that correlate with that pattern. So it's like every so it's like, if you see, if you come back and see that plant again, is that plant has a certain oscillatory pattern in your mind certain, asteroids, configuration, or configuration of oscillators.

20:37

And and what happens is, you see the plant again and someone has like added if you see it like one day and you come back the next day and someone has has made it look like a Christmas tree, right? So now you have the previous oscillation being magnified to the global oscillation, which then finds the oscillation of the plant that, that, that didn't have.

21:06

It didn't look like a Christmas tree and it didn't have ornaments on it Christmas ornaments and it compares the two, right? So your model of the plant from four when you learned it without the Christmas ornaments existed as a combination of oscillations tracked. But that's tracked in by the solution apps by listening to pattern recognition system, okay?

21:32

And so what happens is that becomes magnified to the global rain space for the moment that you're looking at the Christmas tree version of the plant and then the Christmas tree versions of the plant. Find it that then finds your the config that that triggers the configuration, that memory configuration that this starts up.

22:00

The particular oscillation, is that previously belonged to that plant? When it didn't when it wasn't, when it didn't have Christmas tree ornaments and a combines that with the plant now that it has persistence. So the plants representations. So now, so now we can take out the plant. It has Christmas tree ordinance on it.

22:18

That's your memory of it. It's now it's like a Christmas plant sort of. Right. It has become the Christmas plant because they had those ornaments on it and that's that because part of its configuration and your mind your memories. And so maybe you'll see, you'll see at some point, you'll see your walk has the window and there are Christmas tree ornaments, there's no plants, right?

22:44

And maybe you'll think, oh, I'll get some of those Christmas tree ornaments and I'll put them on other plants because you're previous memories like also for your tractors pulled. Previously associated patterns back together. And so that's why I think. So, when you see, like a new, when you see a new pattern or like, or when you see an old pad, when you see any pattern that is going to be sort of partially rendered by the new data and partially rendered by, well, basically rendered by your brain based on the new data.

23:21

But it takes a combination of the new data and old data to create the rendering that your mind is going to perceive and it's the oscillation of neurons. That's that is creating a basically. Consciousness is like a higher level representation of a lower level representation. It's like a scaled up fractalization of a smaller learned pattern and so as you move your eyes around the space looking at everything, benches tables, chairs walls window sidewalks.

24:08

See we've got chairs again and cars. There's science. There's basically like road signs and and that I figured these cones are cones. Let's see, there's more. I'm walking past a lot of cars. There's less cement sidewalks as well, more signs public library science food sign about you know, SF Marin.

24:31

And in the thing is like, so energy state. I'm going through a sequence or prescribing different things on my walk, right? And in every step, I, when I describe every each interval is basically, when I say something new, like, if I say there's a car, it's an interval. There's a sidewalk, that's an interval there to some, oh, there's a tree, that's an interval.

24:48

So, each type of interval, right? And and these intervals. Have they have some integral characteristics that can diet the in the memory of those in the association of, it's not just a memory of the characteristics that would be stored in the synapse, but it's the association of different oscillations.


25:13
That's being stored in that synaptic pattern, which is why when you get a new pattern that's tracked by your synapses, it's necessary for the previously learned patterns that your oscillators have learned to be, to be able to react those to those new patterns, and then their reactions sort of cause the pattern to magnify in your mind from the microscope to the measles scale to the macroscale so that you can pay attention to so that you can pay attention.

25:53

And so the experience of consciousness is like, it's like a data connecting pattern at a high level, paying attention to data connecting patterns at a lower level paying to date in their and they are in turn and paying attention to data collecting patterns at the microscale level. But the the thing is like all three scales are paying attention to these patterns at all, level simultaneously, all levels in all areas of development.

26:31

So I mean I would say that the it's kind of like every area of the cosmos or every area of your brain is simultaneously, not, okay, so not the cosmos but I mean. Okay? So every not the cosmos, this is like. So this this part is pertains to the brain.

26:47

So like every area of brain, it's guys. 

28:00
And that, that friction ultimately was a higher oscillator. That guided my behavior in the right direction but I needed to process in order to help navigate me. I guess I needed to process some pollution that the local idiots that I didn't want to talk to just happened to be conveniently blocking the path that I wanted to go down and recently thought I wanted to go down.

28:25

So I was sort of like I felt hemmed in by the stupid idiot CI age and that directed my path to the more attractive grocery store because that path became less attractive to try that path became scary. And so the, so my mind is like projecting the appearance of monsters on the past that it doesn't want me to go down so that I can move intowards the paths that I really like, which is less tensioned.

28:59

And it's so, but it took my mind of going through, like I said, like a computer. I had to go through a sequence of singing. These things that I'm observing the weird phenomenon of these, like almost hallucinations that the idiot. Next to me is actually CI agent trying to listen to me, like, over and over again to like, completely random people to like everybody, right?

29:17

Right. And I realized that these were guiding me not but I was focusing on, but I was, I went through the negative focus before I discovered, I discovered the positive intention that the negative was created, but the negatives were created to guide me to that positive in a sense.

29:39

Right? Because I wasn't focusing on where I wanted to go. Where I wasn't yet, connecting what I wanted to do yet, right? So that what I wanted to do was still emerging from my memories processing new information and that triggering prior memories to be updated. And so what I'm sort of like witnessing is that reality is sort of like changing for me, what I'm for what I am projecting on to other people.

30:10

That is, and that is helping to guide that is helping me to create like an inverse guidance system path guidance system, right? And I just like, I'm just like noticing this now, but that seems like very similar to

30:29

You know, like anyway, guys, so imagine that that the, that the neural network is going to oscillate through every button combination until that imprisoned score Like playing the same game over and over again and trying different things. Each time until you get it right, all right, so

31:05

So like, imagine like a reinforcement learning where reinforcement learning is learning how to play a game like Pac-Man, you. What happens is it it's trying to maximize the score, right? So has to link on the buttons that it presses to the events on the game screen because it just tried the events on the game screen.

31:28

So, at least the learners, the features of the game screen that produce a score based upon a random pressing of the buttons, right? And there's many sequences of running pressing out of the buttons, but it's has the goal where it needs to get the best score, but it's linking together, the button presses that is making randomly to the score on the screen, and to the actions that to the features that are appearing as a response to its buttons.

32:04

So if it So basically it's like yeah, so if you learned the pattern that is trying to teach you,

32:18

If you learn, if you learn the, the fact, if if the, if it does multiple sequences and basically it's it starts to prefer the sequences that perform higher scores, right? It's, it's so it's, it's It's like there's a there's a there's the pattern selection process going on where it can basically you know try the patterns basically iterates through every possible like in a methodical way.

33:02

So it could try the pattern that is getting the ultimately the any given tour can be used for good or for evil and includes medical schools but in the case of medical tools, we have the the situation where tools to be used for healing. In addition to other possibilities that are for healing and potentially lead to the greatest common good.

33:51

And so, while the technology of self-aware networks I could be is potentially dangerous. It's also essential that mankind can be united as a team in some sense, right? Everyone working on the same global project, everyone working together at the same company like imagine hat, like if there was only one company on the planet, right there could still be different governments like different governments, right?

34:33

So each each territory would have its own government, that would be the people of that territory would have the greatest representation over over the or the laws of their own territory, right? And they would, they would also participate in be compliant with federal laws that have limited jurisdiction. But they enforce sort of like because the norm of individual rights for everyone to your degree, right?

35:16
And you know you don't you can't obviously you can't walk into a daily and pee on the cheese. All right. So it's not like it's not the right to harm other people so there's there's it. There's the catch, right? So it's not infinite rights but it is it's the government can have a world helping to establish the norms and to define the strictest laws like you know, you don't you're not harm other people denominator to other people do not harass other people.

35:48

And so if you're not do the kinds of things that lead to

36:00

Worse outcomes. But that's sort of like the sort of like the idea of the potential bed, the whole potential benefits to to lies as is being one of one of many pieces. One of many pieces of, you know, there's community coming to outreach programs, going to be independent or they could be, you know, they could be sponsored by corporations.

36:35

But anyways, I mean, so the idea of a single corporation that we all I worked at is, in one sense. It's not, that's not actually a good idea, right? We all like me on it. Like, you have when you have a monopoly like they end up like there's no challenge to them in the marketplace, the freedom of the marketplace allows for works when small startups are able to compete with the existing established companies and when the prevented from doing.

37:17

So the the monopolization attacking talent. It's like it's it's you know, you can make an argument. Well, certain products are only achievable at large scale, with lots of people working together, lots of great people working together, certain certain products need large teams. And so you start to maintain their large teams, you know.

37:53

They, they end up like doing things, like trying to pull other products into themselves to talk about other people's products. People so start developing products on their own and in a bigger company, to try to suck them up, like, oh, okay, well, I don't want this new company to start competing with me because then it's gonna get big, there, become a bigger oscillator.

38:13

So I try to absorb it instead so that I can stay in control. Yeah, but but also like, sort of like network them in with the existing people. But basically, it accomplishes having people being able to work together and

38:33

That's that's that's it's a sort of like the pooling concept.

38:40

The cooling concept is like you know, you could try to not have deep learning but the pulling concerts like you could try to question word

38:57

You could to buy some computers and start mining blockchain, right? You could do that. But sometimes when you might, but if you just join a pool of minors, it might be easier for you and low and sort of like lower risk and you will potentially get a payout. If everyone else gets a pass maybe you have a greater chance of getting part of the payout and any wood trying to get one despite your own thing.

39:32

So,

39:37

And you have to wonder, maybe that would be simulating like magnetically. Simulating to to areas where those beam reflectance points can converge sort of like an idea of how like the pyramid of Giza when they studied it. They're like well this can cut. This can focus sort of like electromagnetic, electromagnetic energy, sort of like a similar content to a satellite dish or, you know, I don't all right, Adam, that sounds great acoustically, right?

40:52

Or yeah. A or, you know, similar to like the red rocket amphitheater and in Denver Colorado, right? When you have like a really great shape that focuses sound and so that would be like sound is like a mechanical wave move through the air long shooting away that you you have also for the same reason.

41:22

If if the yeah, if a surface with a certain material like like that used in the permanent visa, like limestone that might be very useful for reflecting the electromagnetic waves. I don't know, I don't know, very acoustic properties of blood stone. And I don't know what would be the best materials for in the worst materials for reflecting, electromagnetic, waves or sound waves.

41:48

That's an interesting area to like look into, right? So the brain obviously is not shaped like a pyramid. It's not shaped like a soup, like a perfect square. I mean, you have the sort of oval shape of the skull cavity and a sort of oval stairs shape of the, of the out of the mouth and almost reshape with the eye.

42:13

Here's the ear canal. All right. So we've got these cavities and these cavities are lined with sensor arrays, like the retina, or the tongue or the for your hand, that since it has sensor raised. What's your all over your skin? So you can feel everywhere. You say that fashion fashion tech designer Anita, she has this idea for how to make a dress, touch sensitive, and that involves embedding electrically, conductive fibers into the dress, and then wiring, and then connecting them to a touchpad, a touch screen device.

43:01

Turn the electrodes on the screen. Array into a touch mapping program. It's showing conductor fabric and so she's able to make a address that can recognize your questions basically fabric. But interestingly like you could also put LEDs so that as you touch a certain area of the dress like, right?

43:56

And and this interesting like yeah because something like like a resume like a raspberry pi pico for it, could you make them? You make the program work so that you just need to, you know, plug it in and it runs automatically. And then when you run your fingers across the fabric, you'll see like LEDs light up where your fingers were so you can like, trace patterns on on your clothing and they'll appear as lights for short.

44:32

Wild accord disappearing again but that sort of like this. Like what I want to the you think about is like we have sensor arrays, right? And they can track. They can track temporal sequences of patterns as their received. So, imagine finger on on the array and you can draw an arrow or something, what you could do, that's what might be doing.

44:56

And then you're bringing it taking the pattern of your retina and it's remembering that pattern. And that pattern is being magnified. Through through oscillate is meant being magnified by oscillations to other oscillations. And so it's being transmitted all over your brain. And the different parts of your brain are learning your incoming patterns and different ways and they're in the different parts of your brain are.

45:36

Combining those learned patterns in different ways but also look with, but they're also cooperating and learning different pattern distinctions like they're different. They're like your brains, learn different points of view on the patterns that it's is receiving like, because it's connecting patterns together because patterns, that you've learned previously become a tractors for similar patterns.

45:59

And so the development of patterns happens and so you, the post part of a tree, eventually becomes a movie of a tree over time and a movie of trim tree from every angle and all the different angles that you can understand that tree from including all the trees properties, including how the tree sounds how the true feels and how the tree looks all the different properties of the tree.

46:23

The facts of the tree can burn, that's a property of the tree, the fact that you can carb up the tree and you can make paper. That's that's it. That's a property of the tree in a sense. It's not. I mean, it's not necessarily like maybe I'm not crazy in that correctly but it's it's a potential outcome for the tree that the tree could become paper.

46:41

That's a, that's not, it's not in all trees. It's that gonna be likely for but it's that's potential outcome. Some trees get turned into the paper where it's been done before, but the idea is that your mind is sort of like organizing it's patterns by by configure. Basically, the patterns are our learning the configurations of oscillators and when you get more angles, you get more configurations of oscillators with those configurations converge.

47:16

And so you're you're one separate representations of different features of different things eventually linked together. And so your mind can sort of like trace the path of different representations. And then you what you have is you have different areas that your brain playing back different interpreters, different representations in a sort of loop so that you can basically like explore your.

47:44



You can have a neuro path that basically walks you through lot of different representations, right? And he walks you through all these representations because you are looking for a way to It's harder You're looking for a way to improve your score. And anyway, I mean you're like it's all linked to your goals and your goals are linked to the complexity of your memory formation and their adjusted statistically by the by the adjacent adjacent opportunity.

48:28

Very so like, you know, as you go through as you as you advance in the intervals of time of space time, regardless of what input you're getting as you advance in the inputs of space time. The complexity of your cognitive patterns develops and, you know, I think, you know, I wonder if perhaps, you know, I've been looking at this sort of like fail state incorrectly.

49:03

Like the idea was you only advance when you fail but you know from failing and then trying again, but that's not exactly, right? It's it's that if you look at the action perception cycle, make sure that's recording is on if you look at this act, if you look at the action perception cycle, you're understanding advances.

49:25

If, when you model something through the, through the physical act of thinking about it paying attention to it, observing it from multiple angles, like both in the physical sense, but also in the metaphorical sentence. So, you're understanding of the concepts of your whole reality developing you think about them.

49:44

And when do people stop and like, really like think about their models of reality? Well, it is often when they face the hearts that back, that confuses them. And so they take the action of pausing to really think about things, but the lesson I'm taking away from this is that we do not necessarily need to because I mean, their situation where people fail hard and they don't evolve, they don't evolve and they continue to feel hard.

50:14

They continue to repeat the same mistakes so it's not necessarily the case that failure is is especially there's some other convention. There's not necessarily the case that needs them under intentions, there's plenty of meat that's like never ending. Some people are forever needing they're not changing, right? Not advancing, they're not a business, it's not.

50:36

So it's not that neat is about every benefit. It's more like it's more like reflection and contemplation. Right. That's more like the mother of invention. If you couldn't get like, sort of like and this is why I think. Yeah. So if you can kind of get into like isolation like if you can get some isolation maybe like a sense of your deprivation tank, right?

51:03

And if you can just meditate, then your mind will come up with new will, organize will come up with the higher order of organizational complexity, right? Especially like, in, not like, especially thinking, yeah, if you can go through again, audio track that guide you through the different sort of like gamma beta alpha theta frequencies, that might help.

51:29

And a sort of like threading together the different frequencies of your mind. And and and allowing you to sort of like the organizational complexities of knowledge to to deepen. So I'm sorry, I summarizing things like. Okay. So like when things are going great for you, you might not want to to stop the good sensory input to pause and reflect.

51:57

You might be having such a good time that you don't stop and allow your mind to reorganize at a higher state. And so you have some people who maybe they're like taking advantage of, you know, their beauty and the fact that other people want to do things with them free and they're allowing the world to work for them.

52:41

It's okay. You want to work for me. Okay. And so imagine that Iran disappear, the in between each for each vector, the amplitude, the amount of the amount of the, the amplitude of the number of possibilities that particle could move in the direction of the sphere becomes magnified, right?

53:11

It's like if you have a one and four tons of firing. But now numbers three and four merged together, your chances of change. Because now you have like, you know, you have it's like having a one and three chance of firing but you get but you there's two of those three.

53:36

Chances are going to trigger the same. We're going to trigger the same oscillation. But anyway, so that oscillation combined has a larger effect.

53:50

And in terms of creating, like basically the likelihood that a pattern will move towards that oscillation is is 50% instead of 1/3. So that, although that oscillation has better chances of being a collider along, the lane that it travels. And so, if you have the convergence of lanes, as facilitated by an oscillator, the traffic lanes, then the chances that of a vertical of a vertical collision in between that oscillation point.

54:31

And any other point relative to that space is much higher. And so because the chances of a particle moving in the direction or higher, it's it's is it is pinching space time itself, and pulling, whatever is in that lane towards it slightly more often than whatever's in that lane moves through the left to the right, which you could have objects moving like basically falling to the left, or to the right also, basically like horizontal horizontal travel.

55:09

It's just the horizontal travel with what, you know, that's like an orbit. It's like orbital travel, right? But it's just going to be based on the scale from the origin point of the oscillator but this the distance-based scale. So I mean, based on the distance from the center of the oscillator and the magnitude of the oscillator that's going to be sort of like this fading of of attraction because the line, the lions are emanating from the oscillator are going to have an increasingly less amount of effect.

56:04

On space farther, they get away from the oscillator because they're fanning out. That's not something fans out. The distance between the different fans is broadening and so that like defines the curvature of space but also the patterns that are moving for horizontal, have they continue to have a chance of moving downward, more more often.

56:31

So the percentage moving that are moving. Horizontal are still going to be pulled downwards little by little in. And when that happens in aerodynamics today, well, now that's the abstract from the from the air pressure but I'm saying that that would work in and avoid a space as well, because the, the drag front, the drag in the that, I'm saying that the place feels

57:14

For the, the particle graph, the particle field Part of a field itself is going to exert drag. Because every point in that field is it's travel is being manipulated by the oscillating points in space and it's resulting in the appearance of the curvature of space time. But really it is we thought of as a warping in the trajectory of the universe of a particles warping in the trajectory of particles.

57:53

And so it's like space time is not in in one sense because it's not curving. But what's happening? Is that changes in the direct? And in the, in the direction of particles is happening and it creates the functional, the increased, the functional appearance of gravity and space time. So we have an effect curving space time where there's no, where we have the effective curving space time, but that effect is the result of particle veins.

58:32

Converging at different points and different oscillators. So they so the Saturday and oscillator the sun is just increasing the chances that we moved towards the sun, that the particles that make up everything, the towards the sun and there increasing the but there's also the horizontal movement of earth so that it remains the horizontal movement remains a continuing possibility for those particles as well.

59:11

So of course if the if the earth you know, collided with another earth size body then it would it might fall out of orbit, you know, now or you know, it's trajectory could be changed. I don't know how much exact, how much magnitude is going to take to change this trajectory of the planet, but another planet out to do it.

59:37

Sort of like that another part of the same size up to a sort of like the principle of Poi advos. But you'd have to get away from.
