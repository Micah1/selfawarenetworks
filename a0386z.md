(field, decoherence, cortex) old physics ideas
5. the symmetrical splitting and recombination of matter and anti-matter has to travel longer distances depending on which route it takes, because of the unevenness of space
6. the longer routes that splitting matter has to take in order to recombine means that matter sticks around longer than it would stick around if space was perfectly even
‎7. so we have now a pattern of increasing lumps in space, because the matter now has to travel around other lumps of matter in order to recombine
8. and the opposite energies of matter and anti-matter means that they repel each other, resulting in the opposite of gravity, and that same energy is responsible for the gravity of matter on matter, and the gravity of anti-matter on anti-matter
9. The routes take on a sort of spiral pattern, because literally the matter has to travel around other matter, no further and no less, in order to return to it's original state
‎10. This spiral pattern is really a fractal pattern of the energy of the matter splitting at a very precise decay rate.
11. The unevenness of space causes a break in the symmetry of the fractal pattern, and this is why one side of it can end up looking like a black hole of nothing, and the 
12. The decay rate of particles is continuous because of the apparently random quantum range.
13. The resulting of interaction between the spiraling matter (and anti-matter) with the randomness of the quantum range results in a natural selection of matter patterns.
14. These patterns becomes so complex through time, thanks to this process that eventually they can take on atomic forms, become stars, that form more atomic forms, 15. The cool thing is, this fractal pattern in the energy of matter, anti-matter, interacting with the seemingly random quantum range of spacetime is analogous to the development of patterns of thought in the human brain.
16. See if the world around us, filled with people, and life, is essentially chaotic, that's analogous to the quantum range
17. What life does, what cells do, and what the neo cortex does especially well is it becomes a pattern of increasing complexity, because of the natural selection from the decaying rate of random particles
‎18. The patterns of thought, and the patterns of matter are analogous because they increase in complexity with the experience (interaction) of the random world (random particle decay) because interaction with the inherent instability of spacetime
19. So while the yang of space is apparently random entropy, the yin of space is increasing extropy that is the result of continuous balance between the opposite energies of the universe
20. The uneven paths that the extropy (matter and anti-matter) side has to take to deal with the chaotic terrain of the entropy side is resulting in the novel creation of patterns, that keep developing according to the natural selection of patterns in spacetime, which means that space itself began to think, a very long time ago
21. The patterns of matter are creating even more complex patterns of matter. Through this natural selection the conscious universe is manifesting human beings and all 22. the creator is the extropy which is the yin, which is the opposite of the yang which is the entropy which is the illusion
Short summary, the universe is awareness, and your it, all of it.
the abstract entity is evolving, while remaining consistent to the core physics of the universe at fundamental levels.
isnt matter a manifestation of pure cosmic energy? yes
Can one be radical and say space is energy and complex patterns of matter all derive from it? yes
So anti matter and matter is space at completely different levels of densities. Yes
23. The density increases when the route of a matter traveling around other matter lengthens the time the amount of time before it's decay, and the density of mass increases more in some parts of the universe, because the decay rates are effected by the traveling time of matter
24. Matter and Anti-matter are energy, and with a longer traveling time they are also mass. What's that silly equation something about mass being energy divided by the speed of light?
25. energy equals mass times the rate of particle decay in even space, since space is not even, we get all kinds of cool effects, like light slowdown, and clocks changing their change rate at on the space shuttle because of different densities
Energy equals Mass multiplied by the collision rate of matter and anti-matter in ideal space (even space with no density)
the speed of light is close, I have to give Einstein props for being almost accurate!
Accurate enough actually that all his equations are still valid
I will call the theory "Very Specific Relativity" new short summary: matter evolves in complexity because of the uneven quantum possibility, resulting broken fractals, resulting in novel patterns of matter and matter density resulting the natural selection of patterns in space, resulting in evolution of patterns, and thus space began to think, and allowed the awareness of light, let there be light!
An anti-matter person on the other hand would find anti-matter to be very attractive.
The reason there is so much "Cosmic Energy" is because Matter and Anti-matter cannot stand each other, they keep splitting apart, but on average they are as one.
‎26. Gravity (the law of attraction) is matter curling around itself, because it is increasingly fed up with being one with (anti-matter), relative to the the total amount of peaceful space and the raw unbiased possibility of particle location.
yes anti-matter is physical, and as a matter being you would find it repulsive.
