a0595z ctp like Micah your an entity
what does that mean?

like your mind is a spatial entity analogous to a 3D point cloud of multiple rendered representations of reality interacting with one another to achieve an entropic goal.

The brain's network is actually a brainwave sequencer, that detects phase patterns and converts them into rendered spatial temporal conceptual maps of reality and self for this brain thinking that it is a person when it is a machine exactly.

We are organic machines, organic robots, many of us thinking we have souls

your mind is produced by neurons that pump salt water, so you are just a computer

you have no real choice, but as a neural network you will continually refine your choices, and make better choices as become aware of better choice so awareness practices can increase your awareness of your choices

my central thesis is that neurons cluster into arrays and these arrays serve as screens for other clusters to see

hypothesis tnn8 is the idea that Receptors on a t-cell can act as a neural network in pattern detection, the question then is can multiple receptors like a pentareceptor detect when multiple boutons have been triggered?
