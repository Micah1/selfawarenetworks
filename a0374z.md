Jules Urbach is the CEO of OTOY, Inc a company that offers products like Octane Render, Lightstage, Orbx. As a company OTOY really wants to build whatever it takes to get us to the holodeck. The mission for OTOY is to build the software stack in places where there are efficiency barriers.

Urbach has been a pioneering force in the development of holographic capture, extremely high resolution graphical rendering, to making it possible to stream these live high-resolution lightfield gpu rendered graphics over networks to your Gear VR or Hololens or Tango. He has worked with Facebook to help them build out a cloud render pipeline that turns the data from Facebooks new 6 degree of freedom cameras into volumetric video that you can share on your facebook timeline or jump into with vr, and what's even more amazing is not only can you walk around inside volumetric movies on a mobile phone that look better anything on current desktop VR systems, but you this data slips seamlessly into game engines like Unity so you can define a volume of space that you want to make interactive in unity and drop the Orbx point cloud into that volume so it becomes an interactive movie.

The technology he is making is in a sense is making it possible that particular scene in Ready Player One https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One when Wade has to go into a Virtual Reality re-creation of Wargames (1983) that is so photo-realistic that he gets to stand next to Matthew Broderick's character who also looks photo-realistic, and then he has to interact with the movie because the movie itself is now fully interactive.

These are the types of experiences we will have in the next couple of years.

I spoke to Jules to learn more about streaming light field over web vr, and we also talked about Neural Lace and speculated on what it might take to pipeline graphics directly into the brain.
