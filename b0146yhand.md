b0146y Hand Modified Transcription

This was one of the earlier notes that I worked on before I had Whisper, the transcription was so broken that I added a significant amount of hand written text to fix it and fill in the blanks. The result is that it has content that isn't in the Whisper version of the document, including links. I went back and compared it to the original google transcription without any changes and I was able to highlight the major changes by putting the new statements, or the recrafted statements in italics.

Note there is a Whisper version of this note that corresponds 1:1 with the audio.

Disclaimer: After rereading Graziano months after this note I take back my earlier assessment or criticism of Graziano's TPJ Consciousness Module Conjecture, in that I do not think he was limiting the function of the TPJ to a consciousness module by virtue of it's activation during phenomenological consciousness perception of an item in front of a subject under study such as an Apple infront of a patient. His view is far broader & more complex in hindsight, but not so self limiting & specific.

Graziano Neurons Consciousness Animals

00:00

Artificial consciousness.

Data & C3PO.

I see Neurons differently.
I see one Neuron is a multimodal sensor in a Neural Network.

It's not news to anybody that neurons oscillate tonically (over time), it's not news to a neuroscientist but you don't hear that in the average description when the function of a neuron is described. 

00:35

*The average conversation isn't about individual neurons doing pattern recognition.* 

They talk about how when a neuron reaches certain thresholds, it fires, but they don't talk about how neurons discriminating against the wrong patterns and firing only when it receives the right patterns.

*The neuron is basically doing pattern recognition right? In order to do pattern recognition.*

01:03

That means that you don't just fire. When you fill up with data, you fire when you receive a certain pattern and you don't fire if you don't receive a certain pattern, okay?

*So I really like, you know, Peter Tse, his book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation.*

01:25

He talked about how a neuron's criteria could be set in terms of thresholds at the synapse.

The NMDA-R Receptor & the AMPA Receptor. They each can have a threshold where if they receive incoming signals within three milliseconds that you know, for example, or two milliseconds, maybe it's three and a half milliseconds, but there's a specific window that they're looking for, if signals arrive outside that window, that's not going to cause that's a synaptic firing event.

02:21

It's not going to, you know, cause a the neuron to fire. We also want to say there's definitely opportunities for neurons to reject signals. Like you could get a lot you know the example of the neuron that only fires when it receives horizontal data, it is, imagine that this neuron could be sent a whole bunch of vertical data and the form of like having you know neurotransmitters being sent from other neurons to it, but because that's the wrong pattern it has to have some way to refuse that flood of electrical activity so that it doesn't fire when it gets the wrong pattern.

03:38

Sodium channels could be blocked, down-regulated, or inhibited or it could be that the that potassium channels could be upregulated or or opened early so that potassium floods out earlier to inhibit the potential of the action potential to delay it from happening.

04:20

Events on the synaptic level can modify the operation of what the synapse responds to (bidirectional synaptic signalling)


04:45

And then the dendrite itself can... I don't know all the mechanisms about how a cell might reject incoming signals or how it might self inhibit firing. If it's not getting the pattern that it's looking for. But that is the basically, the hypothesis, that is basically a hypothesis, and it cuts to like basically the granularity of pattern detection.

05:22

Whether there is like a microscopic pattern detection, whether each neuron can be a pattern detector. And I've heard arguments to say, okay well you know whether the whether they're not there is a paper that came out that say the neuron is a two layer, neural network. And then there was later paper that said well the dendrite is a five-layer neuron network, and it can record tempo & spatial patterns across across its membrane.

05:54

They can detect tempo & spatial patterns, right?

*A spatial pattern could be electromagnetic pattern that consists of concurrent or consecutive neural activity across space, (meaning across neurons, across synapses, across cortical columns, across the brain). (On the receiving side to start with) you have a lot of different receptors and a lot of different branches of a dendrite?*

06:16

*And it's a spatial pattern because it's like pixels (the components of pictures) all over the place.*

*Note: I like the analogy of pixels because in a tv pixel the color of the pixel represents a different phase wave pattern of light, in the brain we are talking about phase wave patterns of the electromagnetic spectrum also, just not the light part of the spectrum.*

There's a literally a space between different activations of different dendritic branches, with different receptors, with sodium, potassium, calcium and cloride being pumped into or out of different branches of dendrites across neural arrays, that's a spatial pattern. And then over time as the amount of sodium (potassium, etc) increases or decreases, or in otherwords when the amount of charge increases or decreases in these branches of the dendrite...

07:03

That is the physical manifestation of a temporal pattern. If there is this learned sequence, where branch number one fills up, branch number two, fills up, branch number three fills up, in that order. 

*The neuron is going to remember the order of that sequence, because that sequence only works within a certain time frame*

*(such as milliseconds when talking about NMDA & AMPA receptor coincidence detections)*

*that sequence changes produces enough charge inside a temporal window.*

*This means that the dendrite over time is detecting sequences of phases changes, or phase differentials, that either match or do not match the criteria that dendrites unique morphology, grown synaptic connections, and active receptor configuration has learned to respond to.*

*The dendrite is enabling the cell to detect phase changes that arrive in specific sequences within a specific time window that is a topological or spatial distribution*

*Note: search for a0138z.clusteron on github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks It talks about how when two NMDA spikes are next to each other on the same branch, and they are coincidently activated, the dual activation produces a voltage*

08:03

(To recap) So there is a temporal window of phases being received on the topology of the dendrite with literal & physical embodiment of charge building up, (primarily) via injection of sodium ions and the exfiltration of potassium ions right there is a literally, like, a short term timing & duration mechanism.

08:48

*This process is learning tempo-spatial patterns of phases changes.*

*Phase changes are detected with coincident arrival times resulting from a distribution of signals of varying magnitudes & frequences between cells.*

*A phase change detection can represents a firing sequence change, that contains firing rate changes, or firing neuropath change (the paths of Sharp Wave Ripples, or regular action potentials that inhibit other neurons whose activity will cause other neurons to change the timing of their spiking,  across neural arrays, neural circuits, edge communities, and a broad diversity of cortical column types.*

# *"Confusing Cortical Columns"*
*"Although the anatomical and functional columnarity of the neocortex has never been in doubt, the size, cell composition, synaptic organization, expression of signaling molecules, and function of various types of “columns” are dramatically different. Columns could be defined by cell constellation, pattern of connectivity, myelin content, staining property, magnitude of gene expression, or functional properties. For example, there are ocular dominance columns, orientation columns, hypercolumns, and color columns, to mention only those described in the primary visual cortex (12), that differ from each other as well as from the columns of the alternating callosal and ipsilateral projection in the frontal lobe (8) or various minicolumns advocated by Szentgahotai (7), Eccles (9), Buxhoeveden and Casanova (10), and a more recent detailed reconstruction of barrel field columns by Sakmann and colleagues (13)"*
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0807271105

# *"Mixed functional microarchitectures for orientation selectivity in the mouse primary visual cortex"*
*"The cerebral cortex is a network of billions of neurons. To understand such a complex network, it is important to understand how the network can be divided into its components. The cortex is partitioned into areas, and each area can be further divided into functional modules1. However, the smallest units of functional module organization remain unclear."*

*"Anatomically, two smallest units of cortical architecture have been observed: minicolumns and microcolumns. A minicolumn is a one-cell-wide vertical array of cell bodies running perpendicular to the cortical surface2,3. In cats and humans, these arrays run through the cortical layers and are regularly distributed, with a spacing of ∼20 μm in between4,5. The other unit is a microcolumn, which is a group of neurons roughly located vertically, and their apical dendrites (layer 2/3 and 5 pyramidal neurons) make a bundle in the upper layers6,7. Neighbouring dendritic bundles are separated with a spacing of ∼30 μm in the visual cortex of rats6 and of cats8. Because some apical dendrites take lateral shifts as these dendrites ascend, minicolumns and microcolumns are not identical6. Although it has been repeatedly suggested that minicolumns or microcolumns may be the smallest anatomical module in the cortical architecture1,9, the functional properties of neurons within minicolumns or within microcolumns have not been investigated, and whether minicolumns serve as functional units for cortical processing remains in debate1,4,9."*
https://sci-hub.se/https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13210

*A phase change is a change in the phase wave signal between two or more neural arrays that are firing and its detection happens between a millisecond time scale (NMDA receptors) and a seconds time scale at the soma. (BTSP Behavior Timescale Synaptic Plasticity)*

*Okay so with Attention Schema*

he's proposing that there are some mechanisms that are driving attention that are not directly related to the neurons themselves, or that they're neurons at a higher level that are driving attention at lower levels.

*It could be possible for different levels of neurons to each be contributing to driving attention, because essentially neurons are selecting & being selected to be part of a play back of patterns, or a play forward of patterns, and their role in a sense based on preferred patterns they have learned to play back, and what other neurons they learned to play sequences back with.*

So maybe the the pattern is partially triggered and that causes the network to play back that pattern to try to complete a pattern and it's sort of like the momentum of that pattern being partially triggered,

10:47

# *b0146y.thought thought is an oscillating memory prediction rendering*
*This oscillating memory prediction rendering is in other words a feedback loop of sequences of phase wave differentials rippling across neural arrays & thru minicolumns.*

This might cause the neuro circuit to go in search of that pattern, *and so by going in search of that pattern*, it might drive and coordinate the activity of other neurons in the pursuit of completing the pattern that it thinks it detects. And so, you have basically ensembles of neurons, or neurons at different levels, large groups of neurons, but also single neurons at a tipping point that can shift the direction of behavior towards the selection of one pattern or another based upon what the sequence thinks is going to be there.

11:38

*And maybe we could define what neurons are attracted to (like exciting or depressing phase differentials?) and it might be that oscillating neural arrays are attracted to completing certain patterns (an array detection & rendering of a signal output sequence to other neural arrays), and certain patterns that have certain rewards (read consequences, excitation & inhibition, more ATP, or more atrophy, equilibrium stablization or loss of equilibrium) we could argue those are chemical rewards in some instances.*

*But the chemical rewards are linked to patterns being completed essentially, but it's like the magnetic, electric, and chemical momentum of completion because of the rhythm and readiness of neurons to complete patterns*
 
sometimes induces a situation where the organism is driving the completion of its own patterns or driving its own narrative and deviation of signals that the external environment is trying to feed the system.

*It seems that Michael Graziano thinks of consciousness as it has, you know, something that one tiny piece of your brain adds, like it's something you add on to your models of reality.*

13:06

So he describes that you have a model of something visual in your visual cortex, and maybe you have models of words in your auditory cortex, and you'll be able to identify faces in your temporal cortex. 

13:35

But then somehow that activity in the temporal parietal junction of the TPJ is going to add a consciousness module to the whole operation. That conscious module means you have a model for what consciousness is, but it also means that you're conscious. 

*I think there's an unspoken conflation that he doesn't make,*

14:04

but there's like an unspoken conflation between what part of your brain becomes active (the TPJ) when you are phenomenally conscious of the thing that your lower senses & brain regions are paying attention to.

*It's possible that you could put an apple in front of someone so that there their eyes can see the apple, but they're not paying attention to the apple.*

14:29

*They're paying attention somewhere else.*

And so there is like this separation between what attention is in the attention schema theory and what consciousness is because you might have an apple in your receptive field that you're not conscious of and so attention and consciousness with two different things.

14:54

But your brain, we might see (with medical imaging) that your brain on the lower levels (perhaps in the visual cortex) is tracking the apple even if it hasn't registered to you (to your conscious mind). What some researchers believe based on their observations is that, when for that person the apple is there, in front of them, and they're aware of it, they see the Temporal Parietal junction lighting up.

15:27

*The Temporal Parietal Junction I joked could be the led (pixel screen) of the conscious mind, because it indicates that conscious consciousness is happening.*

*There is an event synchrony between your rendered experience of being, and your rendered experience of being with an apple in front of you that coincides with the TPJ lighting up*

*I think he interprets it as a consciousness module, which is like, if you have this additional component, then you can be conscious and you can understand what consciousness is and you can describe consciousness, and it's just a module, right?*

16:02

*Like it's a place, or location, of where & when the the model of consciousness (that is the rendering of your perspective) and the model of the multi-modal sensory entity (the Apple) about to be observed sort of like traffics to concurrently.*

# *The Temporal Parietal Junction is like a midway collision point between models of reality that your brain is constructing in different regions.*
*Where is it that you make the connections between what you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch? It's not in V1 the visual cortex at the sensory input from the eyes, it's not in the first layer of somatosensory cortex S1. It's not in the first layer of the Auditory Cortex A1, but it's somewhere in the middle of the sensory input regions, where the connections between neurons meet. The Temporal Parietal Junction is such a place that marks a midway point between your sensory inputs. The Thalami are also such points. Infact there are many convergence points between sensory inputs that are important areas, major hubs of traffic, for the signals in the networks of your brain.*

*The TPJ traffic brings signals together in such a way that you can now, you know, speak of a conscious experience of an apple, and describe yourself seeing it in the present moment. You can say things like, I am conscious (of this Apple) because I'm conscious which is he points out.*

16:24

*Saying that I'm conscious of being conscious is not a very satisfactory things to say. It might be tautological to say I'm conscious because I'm conscious. (like I think therefore I am is a tautology, similar to I think therefore I think, or I am therefore I am.)*

*I think what we are looking for in a next generation Turing Test is a question along the lines of does the machine transform & return information & knowledge in the way a human being would?*

*Can I say something and describe for you in real time right now what I am being shown, pictures, animations, and places?*

(I repeated the same two paragraphs - deleted)
17:34

And people and all the knowledge representations and properties of the model of that represent all these people and get to a place where, you know, my discussion involved of all these concepts is something that is resonating with the other person in a sense that I sense that I am interacting with the human being, or with the conscious entity in some way.

In the case of animals people feel & believe that their dogs are conscious, or their cats are conscious.

18:29

An animal can't obviously can't give you a complex (verbal) response, and transform words into other words, and as far as reading the mind of an animal, an animal can make sounds, and an animal can make movements.

There's a combination of nonverbal communication with auditory communication.

19:02

*It is very interesting that animals like human beings take turns communicating.*

*When you communicate with it with a cat you can make various sounds and a cat will respond to some of your sounds.*

Cats use sounds to communicate with one another and so there's like a hissing sound, which means the cat is not happy and so you can make inferences.

19:39

We'll it's not happy about what? It's whatever is in association spatially or temporarily with that hissing sound, you know, like, oh, there's a raccoon in the window. Okay. The cat's hissing. They get like telling that other animal to get away or something or letting the rest of us know that there's a raccoon in the window.

20:05

So animals are communicating, but then, you know, you can talk to an animal but the animal is really, is really able to take turns listening to what your expression is. And animals seem to stop and consider. Evens birds. 

20:30

I've seen birds look around and consider the movements of people and bicyclists in cars.Their listening and watching with their eyes and ears for, like self-driving car ought to be doing.

*The bird, if you imagine that it has a computational brain, rendering patterns between it's neural arrays, has to predict where it can fly, and where it can't fly.*

*It has to predict the landscape and has to predict the momentum and orientation and direction, and the velocity of everything, every object in its flight path vicinity, of the birds local ecosystem.*

*Then it has to predict it's own flight trajectory. Which I imagine is a Sharp Wave Ripple from it's Hippocampus.*

21:16

*The birds brain has to do these complex calculations otherwise it might get hit by a bicycle, or get hit by a car, or get eaten by by a larger bird.*

That's the key. Is that is that there is a sort of I don't want to say handshake but it's sort of exchange, and the exchanges between humans and animals.

21:47

*They have, there's exchange rates, temporal exchange rates, like the rates and which I'm going to listen for about this long before I talk. I'm going to observe for about this long before I do.*

This sort of external communication, an exchange, between animals between persons it also happens inside your brain where you have basically networks of cells that are chatting which means that some of them are sending messages while others are listening, and then the ones that were that sent messages become inhibited for a while.

22:41

While a different set of neurons is going to fire based on their response to what they listened and while that's happening there's another set of neurons that's listening to those neurons, and those neurons when it's their turn to fire maybe the first set of neurons is ready again?

23:09

*And so this is yeah. This is like the three sets of neurons model.*

Like imagine you had just to oversimplify it, imagine that you had the entire V1 is going to respond at once, and it's going to respond by some of the neurons getting excited, and some of them being inhibited, and some of them remaining in a tonic oscillation.

23:42

*Most of them remaining in a tonic oscillation.*

Then so then you have the V2 and the V2 is listening to the V1. And so now in the V2 you're going to have the neurons that were listening which is, you know, all of them you're going to have a situation where some of them get excited and some of them get inhibited.

24:08

*And this (the V1 signals) is a reflection of the patterns that they (the V2) were observing, but it's a transmission reflection. So the transmission is the reflection, (or the rendering). Some of the signals will keep going up the minicolumn hierarchy, and some signals, travel back down to V1. Signals in Layer 2/3 will also travel laterally, horizontally, across cortical columns. The travel of signals is on 3 Axis, X, Y, Z, and bidirectional on each axis so signals travel in 6 directions, and they loop, the activity oscillates in feedback cycles, and eventually the output is your motor movements.*

24:40

*Signals in the brain travel up & down, forward propagation & back propagation. They travel left and they travel right. They travel forwards and backwards. Some signals are inhibitory, some are excitatory. The changes in the magnitude & frequency of signals define what information is in your brain.*

*The paths signals travel are very specific & very precise. Some cells detect patterns so they can inhibit parts of other cells to prevent the misrecognition of patterns. (Inhibitory Interneurons or GABA Neurons)*

*Signals fan out, or spread out radially, in some cases or fan in depending on the neuropath they are on. Signals might shoot up from Layer 3 to Layer 4 of the visual cortex, they might shoot up to the parietal cortex and or down to the temporal cortex, some travel to and from the auditory cortex, and then you have these convergence points like the Temporal Pariety Junction, where sensory information seems to collide, at least in terms of measurable brain activity, when you are consciously attentive to something in a multi sensory way.*
