Imagine a future where advancing intelligence unlocks unimaginable possibilities. As Demis Hassabis from DeepMind aptly puts it, "If we solve intelligence, we solve everything else." In such a world, robots exponentially increase production, leading to unprecedented levels of wealth and purchasing power. It’s a future where owning a spaceship could be as feasible as owning a car today.

This vision ties together fascinating ideas—like the Mentat from Dune and the simulated realities of The Matrix—and builds on Sky Nelson’s quantum physics-based concept that each of us exists in our own virtual reality, akin to an interactive video game. These "games," or realities, constantly intertwine, influencing one another.

Fast forward 30 years, and this fusion of ideas becomes reality: self-aware, sentient, and phenomenally conscious robots will revolutionize every aspect of life. These robots will take over all work, catalyzing breakthroughs in medicine, technology, and more. With such advancements, our purchasing power will soar, and we’ll find ourselves in a world of unparalleled opportunities.

Perhaps most exciting is the convergence of our physical reality with the Metaverse—a blending of the simulated and the tangible. This hybrid reality will seamlessly integrate the Metaverse into the world around us, creating a dynamic environment where the boundaries between the two dissolve, transforming technology and how we live in ways we can only begin to imagine.

all right sending us into space for example you know as Demis Hassabis from DeepMind says if we
solve intelligence we solve everything else we'll all what you'll be able to get we'll be able to
purchase in this future world the robots are massively increasing the amount of production
in the world is just purchasing power like you've never imagined you'll be able to everyone
will be able to afford a spaceship and but yeah so I think that our reality and the metaverse
our reality simulation the metaverse will blend together and merge and we'll see the
metaverse in our real world and and technology will be much more exciting that's it
amazing
Micah, can you say that one more time? Sure.
So welcome everybody back to the room.
I was just saying that the future, if we jump forward 30 years from now,
this started off with a conversation about the Meditat from Dune
and how that connects to the Matrix and how the Matrix connects to
the idea of simulation, and Sky Nelson has this really great idea
about basically a quantum physics-based idea that we each,
in our own virtual reality, our own video game,
and these video games are interacting.
But I was saying that in the future we're going to have self-aware,
sentient, phenomenally conscious robots that will do all the work possible
on Earth, accelerating the development of medicine and technology
as Demis Hibisi says, if we solve intelligence, we solve everything else.
We're all going to be rich compared to what our purchasing power is today.
You'll be able to afford your own spaceship.
And interestingly, our future reality simulation will merge and blend
with the Metaverse so that we can see the Metaverse in our real world,
basically everywhere.
Basically everywhere.
