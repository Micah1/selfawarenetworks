Neurons Muscles Barbell

00:01

Stuff. I think, what? All in this, I think you can argue that any person is in the sort of situation where the people they interacted with, in the past have responded to them with with varying degrees of happiness. Some of them significantly less happy than others. And some of them, a lot more happy than others about the past interactions.

00:32

That's not to sort of point fingers at the who did, what first, and what was their causeality. And the responsibility. You know, oftentimes people get people become in the course of a commerce conversation where there's back and forth. Conversation, you're becoming an oscillator with that other person. And if if things are, if the result is a positive outcome, both persons probably contributed to that positive outcome.

01:05

And if it's if it's a less positive outcome, if it's not as positive, both persons probably contributed to that less than less positive outcome. Okay. And so and some cases, you know, the the communications with people that you met in your past or strengthened, in some cases, they're decreased a weekend or broken off.

01:38

And this is sort of like a fractal of what happens at the at the it with your with your neurons on the micro level. It's a fact that because yes so the the neurons are connected by synapses and sometimes the connections grow and sometimes they disappear. And the kind the sort of like analog the the big picture analogy is that the human social network and the social network of neurons.

02:16

They have some frat interesting fractal parallels that that can be considered for potential insights. One of those insights. Might be that people that we are not talking to. Now that we were talking to in the past, they still exist and a shared network, but it's not, it's not like this network has to it, it's not that this network has to become diseased or cancerous.

02:58

Maybe there was some sort of event or lesion that drove people apart, drove the neurons apart and maybe it was traumatic for both. I don't know. But the point is that that if you think of it as a human being is kind of like kind of like a neuron as a functional fractal.

03:27

Functional. Fractal, isomorphism of a neuron in terms of

03:40

Resonating with, with patterns, transmitting patterns, receiving patterns, and storing patterns to replay patterns. There's a, you know, the fractal of a neuron is the fractal of a neurosurgeon is the fractal of a cortical column is the fact of a neuro oscillator. The fact is a factor of your whole brain.

04:08

It's the fractal of a person in the context of their social relationships.

04:16

And So sometimes, you know, we have, I want to say we have, we have breaks with other people or we have unions with other people and he's breaks. And unions can be profound significant transformational. They can cause changes to the people involved, and when There can be. So there could be so think about it this way, so there could be high level configuration reasons for why two neurons don't communicate with one.

05:04

Another anymore that has nothing to do with what either neuron actually did. But it comes from a high level sort of like interference pattern. You can see that in the case that neuroscellators. Well, if you're looking at EEG, at the frequency, at the frequency band of alpha theta, delta gamma it is horizontal bands.

05:35

Sometimes you'll see these vertical fans, intersecting a horizontal bands across spectrum and that's that is higher level dipole activity exerting a sort of taught noun influence on. It's a high level configuration structure, exerting top down influence on on lower level. Configuration structures. And the reverse is also true because this system is sort of Tonically cycling neurons at a slow rate that can that has the effect of hangovers that a lot that this this, this hyper readiness state can allow the the individual of her probation perturbations of small scale, firing to exert an influence on a larger scale assembly.

07:12

And in terms of being that tipping point, thing that the shifts the entire assembly from one state to another but the tipping point. So, the shipping point idea, is sort of like accomplished because tonic oscillations give you a bridge, which means you do not necessarily wish me as you do not need.

07:38

So small oscillations, have a hand. It's like weight displacement, machines at the gym, but weight, displacement machine means that you can do pull-ups. If you don't have enough muscle to lift your weight, as long as the machine is helping you to lift yourself. The machine is giving you like.

11:26

LED is going to trigger your is going to be enough energy to cause your muscles to fire. So we have, you know, for the muscles, we have these gap junctions, which are, you know, the electrical synapses which are basically every every chemical neuron starts out as a as a gap junction neuron, it starts out as an electrical sites for transitioning to being in some cases, becoming a chemical synapse, the chemical synapses sort of like the electrical synapse is sort of free records.

12:15

That structural building block to a chemical snack. So the electrical said there's there was at one point and a life, you're both synapse inside every chemical synapse. And whether that still active or inactive is is is a different question, but if you want the ability for signals to quickly amass power to move muscles, there is a way for that and those are excited to worry.

12:50

Network oscillators that that allow one, small neuronal event to trigger a large cascade of excited neurons. And that produces through the process of Ltd, long-term long-term depression that produces group, oscillatory activity that is going to provide the amount of energy necessary for for coordinated motor function. But that's different from what you the different from what you might need for making sensory distinction.

13:52

So there's what what's useful for making sensory? Distinctions are inhibitory neurons that can really divide up patterns and novel ways. And, Chemical synapses that can break down. Basically, they can break down and distribute the phase information of a single neuron in a, in a way that allows a network oscillator to learn, high level, and varying patterns.

14:38

Multi-dimensional multi-scale patterns.
