The QGTCD.md document is a quick reference to the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation equations.

There is a lot more to share about the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation including how it applies to a lot of physics, but that information is located in other documents on this github and you will have to search for it for now (or chat about QGTCD with Self Aware Networks GPT)

There are several equations that have been proposed relating to the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD) theory proposed by Micah Blumberg 

You can paste the equations that are below into this link to see them rendered correctly.

1. One equation relates the mass of a particle, its frequency, and the number of time frames in its vicinity:
 
mc^2 = \frac{h}{N}f

This equation suggests that the behavior of a quantum particle is influenced not only by its intrinsic properties (such as its mass and frequency), but also by the structure of spacetime in its vicinity (as represented by the number of time frames). This is a significant departure from standard quantum mechanics, which treats spacetime as a fixed, unchanging background.

2. Another equation modifies the Schrödinger equation to include a time-scale factor that varies with position and time:

i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right]\psi(\mathbf{r},t)

This modified time-dependent Schrödinger equation that incorporates the time-scale factor N[r, t] could be written as:
$$
-\frac{{\hbar^2}}{{2m}}\nabla^2\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) + V(\mathbf{r}, t)\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = i\hbar N(\mathbf{r}, t)\frac{{\partial\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}}{{\partial t}}
$$
This equation is similar to the standard time-dependent Schrödinger equation, but with the time derivative on the right-hand side scaled by the factor N(\mathbf{r}, t). This factor represents the local scale of time, which varies with position and time.
The solution to this equation is:
$$
\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{{2\hbar i m N(\mathbf{r}, t) \frac{{\partial\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}}{{\partial t}} + \hbar^2 \nabla^2\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}}{{2mV(\mathbf{r}, t)}}
$$
This solution suggests that the wave function \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) evolves more quickly in regions of space with more time frames (i.e., stronger gravitational fields), as indicated by the factor N(\mathbf{r}, t) in the numerator. This is a significant modification to the Schrödinger equation and would have profound implications for quantum mechanics if it were correct. It suggests that the probabilities of different particle trajectories could vary in a way that mimics the effect of a gravitational force.

3. A third equation relates the energy of a particle to its frequency and the number of time frames:

E = \frac{h}{N}f

The proposed equation E = \frac{h}{N}f is a modification of the Planck-Einstein relation E = hf, which is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics. In the Planck-Einstein relation, E is the energy of a photon, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the photon. This equation shows that the energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency, which is a cornerstone of the quantum theory of light.
The proposed equation introduces a new term N, which represents the number of time frames. This is a novel concept that is not part of standard quantum mechanics or general relativity. The equation suggests that the energy of a particle is inversely proportional to the number of time frames, which could be interpreted as a form of "quantum time dilation".

4. A fourth equation relates the mass of a particle to the number of time frames and the frequency:

m = \frac{h}{Nf}

This equation is a speculative idea that suggests a relationship between the mass of a particle, its frequency, and the number of time frames in its vicinity:
$$
m = \frac{h}{Nf}
$$
Here, \(m\) is the mass of the particle, \(h\) is the Planck's constant, \(N\) is the number of time frames, and \(f\) is the frequency of the particle.
Please note that these equations represent a mix of established physics (the Schrödinger equation and the time dilation equation) and speculative ideas (the new equation for Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation and the equation relating mass, frequency, and number of time frames). The speculative ideas are not currently supported by experimental evidence and would need to be tested further.

# Here are some images of the equations that I posted on Twitter and linked to Github on June 18th 2023 in the file called "00changelog.md":

New Equation for Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation published on social media!
I managed to use ChatGPT with the Wolfram plugin to generate a series of equations that reflect my Unified Field Theory called Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation. Here are some links to pictures of the equations as well as descriptions on Twitter (these were also published on my Instagram and ):

"Folks may see a lot of different equations on my timeline, but they all attempt to express the same idea, which is that the force of Gravity is increasing the scale of time, or the frames of time, or time quanta, or it's changing statistical landscape that guides the likely (1/2)" "direction of particle travel, in otherwords the curvature of space is a curve in time. That is the essential idea of Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation that creates a Unified Field Theory aka a theory of everything that Unites Gravity (with time) at the Quantum Scale.
