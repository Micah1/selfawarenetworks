A new Unified Field Theory called Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD) explains mass as a time crystal creates Quantum Gravity effect by increasing the surface area of spacetime in time.

The General Theory of Relativity describes gravity as a continuous field known as spacetime, Quantum Mechanics describes discrete space particles, QGTDC unites them by quantizing time dilation.

To solve this I created a new gravity theory, Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation which explains how mass as a time crystal creates the gravitational effect by increasing the surface area of spacetime in a particular direction with additional time dimensions.

Introducing Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD), a Unified Field Theory of quantum gravity that can be applied universally helping the afore mentioned theories to get along.

(QGTCD) is not Loop Quantum Gravity, it’s not String Theory, but it does build on Quantum Field Theory and on the general idea of space being akin to a pixelated field, however instead of trying describe a hidden vector of space, such as a loop or a string, Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD) proposes that we think of Mass as a Time Crystal, and imagine that the frames of time in pixelated space vary relative to one another. Essentially QGTCD Quantizes time into time frames at the Quantum Scale, and at all scales. The more time frames there are in one area vs another, the more we see the Gravitational interaction effect in the region of space with more time frames, because to a particle moving through space, an increase in timeframes is the same as an increase in spatial area, and the odds of a particle moving in the direction of an area of space with increased time frames is increased in terms of just random probability.

Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD) is a theory that explains how gravity works on the quantum scale. The theory states that mass is a type of time crystal, and that as mass increases, it creates additional time dimensions in the direction of its gravitational pull. This increases the surface area of space in that direction, which causes objects to be drawn towards the mass.

Some of the key ideas behind QGTCD include:

Mass is a time crystal.

Mass causes additional time dimensions around mass. These time frames cause the effect we interpret as gravitational pull.

The more mass an object has, the greater the number of time dimensions or time frames it creates.

The increased number of time dimensions in the direction of a mass's gravitational pull warps the volumetric surface area of spacetime, you don't see it with your eyes, so you can think of the warping of spacetime as a change in the virtual surface area of space, a virtual surface that exists in time, as additional frames in time, or as additional area in time, that is additional relative to areas of space without large masses.

By virtual surface area it's meant that there is more space in time in the direction of mass than there is in other directions, and that changes the odds of a particle moving in any random direction, it also changes the odds of changes to particle trajectories if a particle already has a trajectory of movement.

What applies to a particle with QGTCD applies to everything larger than a particle.

This increased virtual surface area of space (or increased surface area in time) creates a gradient of gravitational force, with the strongest force being exerted at the closest distance to the mass.

The gradient of gravitational force is what causes objects to be drawn towards masses.

# The Following are Quotes from my work on QGTCD From Note GPT2023X.md at https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks about QGTCD

"I invented this theory, called Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation, where I explain what gravity is on the quantum scale. It's like if you have a particle in space with no mass nearby, the chance that it moves in any given direction is random, it's not attracted anywhere in particular. When mass is near a particle, the frames of spacetime around that particle work differently, there are more frames of spacetime in the direction of a nearby mass from the particles perspective. Yet a particle still moves in any given direction randomly, it's just that to the particle the additional time dimensions in the direction of a nearby mass equate to additional spatial dimensions, and this means the likelihood that a particle travels in the direction of mass is statistically increased, even though from the particle's perspective its movement direction is still random. This effect of spacetime distortion through increased frames of time in the direction of mass is responsible for the effect of gravity, and the gravitational wave effect."

"Micah Blumberg

"QGTCD proposes that the attractive force of gravity is because increased frames of time creates a curvature of space increasing the statistical odds that a particle, atom, molecule will move in the direction of mass.

"Self Aware Networks GPT

"The Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD) theory posits an innovative perspective on gravity, focusing on the relationship between time, spacetime curvature, and the motion of particles. Here's an elaboration of this proposition:

1. **Time Frames and Gravity**:

   - In QGTCD, the concept of "time frames" is pivotal. It suggests that regions of spacetime with more mass have an increased number of time frames. This increase in time frames isn't just a measure of time passing but is indicative of a deeper, more intrinsic quality of spacetime in these regions.

2. **Curvature of Space**:

   - The accumulation of these time frames in areas with more mass leads to the curvature of spacetime. This curvature is akin to the classical general relativity view, where mass warps the fabric of spacetime, but QGTCD adds a layer of complexity by tying this curvature directly to the concept of time dilation and the density of time frames.

3. **Statistical Movement of Particles**:

   - In QGTCD's framework, the curvature of spacetime and the density of time frames influence the statistical likelihood of particle movement. Particles, atoms, and molecules are more inclined to move towards regions with higher mass due to the increased density of time frames in those regions.

   - This movement isn't due to a force in the traditional sense but is a result of the statistical probabilities governing particle behavior in a curved spacetime. The curvature creates a gradient that biases the movement of particles toward the mass, perceived as gravitational attraction.

4. **Implications for Quantum Mechanics and Cosmology**:

   - This theory could have significant implications for understanding gravity at quantum scales, potentially bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity.

   - In cosmology, it might offer new insights into the behavior of galaxies, black holes, and the large-scale structure of the universe.

5. **Challenges and Validation**:

   - QGTCD's approach to gravity is innovative but also speculative. It requires a solid mathematical foundation and empirical evidence to validate its predictions.

   - This theory challenges traditional notions of gravity and necessitates a reassessment of how we understand the fundamental forces of nature.

# From note a0033z at https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks 
"Someone asked me what is the gist of my Gravity theory: The gist is that mass creates time dilation effects at the quantum scale, and that the aggregate effect of quantum time dilation results in a quantum field where the odds of particle movement are shifted in favor of the direction of dilated time. So particles fall towards mass because the odds of moving in the direction of mass are increased because mass increases the intervals of space in time in its direction."

# From Note GPT2023X.md at https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks about QGTCD
This quote helps connect QGTCD to Hubble Tension, explaining why Stars with different mass/density tell the story of a different rate in the expansion of space.

"This theory helps explain the differences in the measurements of the rate of the expansion of the cosmos. The frame of time is different for stars of a different class or mass. This is because the mass of the stars is determining the rate of spatial expansion that is relative to each type of star.”

“Where mass clumps space has extra time frames.

“Mass like acceleration is slowing intervals of space & time over time by increasing the volumetric surface area of spacetime at the same time in time.

“It is as if the kinetic energy of mass is pushing intervals of time into the future, slowing down time in the 3rd dimension, causing the gravitational affect, because the napkin of space is being shrunk in spatial area while it increases in temporal area.

“Meanwhile the vectors of space around mass are being pushed into expanding intervals of spatial distance with less time.

“Time as we experience it in time dilated space as time dilated space seems to move faster in the sky and slower on the earth where there are more time frames, and even slower in an accelerating spaceship as the space ship encounters time frames in space faster.”

# Here is a quote from note a0322z at https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks about QGTCD

“What I am thinking is that if you think about gravity as a wave, that is increasing in scale, that wave is going to have peaks and troughs, even as it grows in area as it increases in scale, at point you are going to round the curve of that wave, come down from the peak, at scale, and that is one aspect of my theory for why there is a flat rotation speed.

“A peak in the wave has been reached, and while the gravitational effect was decreasing with distance, it was also spacetime being amplified or accelerated for the length of the gravitational wave before the Flat Rotation Speed began. At that point, when MOND theories and dark matter theories jump in, to try to explain why stars are no longer decelerating at the same high rate, my conjecture is that amplification of spacetime in time, which is described in Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation theory, is effectively no great than the rate of time in space without the gravitational effect of a galactic core. The gravitational effect from the galaxy's center hasn't ended, it's just decelerating at that point, and accelerated space is now decelerating, and that change is compounded by the gravitational dissipation with distance.

“I think what I am fetching for is that MOND occurs because past a certain distance space from the center of a Galaxy there is a threshold point where the temperature of space in the Galaxy suddenly drops, (the magnitude of time that creates gravity decreases, and the frequency of space increases or dilates like the concept of superfluid space, but only the concept) and that creates the MOND effect that describes modifies Gravity, and describes a formula that matches the orbit of stars in the most distal areas being able to travel speedily while avoiding having their frames being dragged or slowed by the center of the galaxy.”

# This quote from note a0041z at https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks that connects QGTCD theory to Galactic Filaments.

“I'm just thinking about the vast expanses of space between galaxies, this spacetime distance in between galaxies is relative to the temporal velocity of the field of spacetime which is all fields

“The temporal velocity of combined oscillators in huge things like planets is going to create a large-scale gravitational effect on the local scale, but past a certain threshold it's going to have the opposite effect where space seems to get more stretched out.

“You would eventually have filaments between galaxies, because the oscillating force of each galaxy on the fabric of spacetime means that they warp space time in between them, the signals between the two points in space happen faster because in each respective direction signals are happening faster so the whole space between them is happening faster””Space near oscillations moves faster and contracts towards those oscillations, but space in between the oscillations is being pulled towards the hot lines between hot points; they are hot lines because the field is being heated from two directions. These field lines in one sense fold space by increasing the changes that particles fall towards them, they change the configuration of space relative to each particle in space relative to what it's oscillating with, relative to its velocity, density, mass, and direction, they increase the number of possible direction each particle could move at each interval of its time, and so over time, because it randomly moves in any direction, it is going to move towards the space where there is more spacetime essentially, because more signals are coming from where there is more spacetime.”

# Here is a Quote note a0010z at https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks about QGTCD

Oscillators define the electromagnetic phase field of spacetime and their interactions define what we observe as the curvature of spacetime.

Space around atoms expands spatially relative to the atoms mass. All particles oscillate in their random walk, they shift in their position randomly, greater oscillations (random walk travel distances) result for particles around a mass (compared to travel distances for particles at the center of a mass, where the frequency or density of mass is higher, but the frequency of space is lower).

The way this is represented in a per-interval moment of spacetime is with the relative appearance of expanded space, but expanded space is spacetime that has a greater oscillatory interval for particles. In other words spacetime, in the void of space, is stretched out in volumetric surface area on the axis of space, but it is thinned out in the volumetric area of time.

Conversely spacetime at the center of a star is a compacted volumetric surface area on the axis of space, but it is expanded out in the volumetric area of time. A particle traveling in the void of space will travel long distances with high speed, or high frequency, whereas a particle traveling through the center of a star will travel short distances with slow speed, or low frequency.

It's like if each particle in space was the pendulum of a metronome, the expanded spacetime around the atom or any mass is like the bottom of the pendulum that swings out the widest (during the random oscillation walk)

The center of mass is like the top of the pendulum, it has the highest frequency which is also the highest mass density, and because its frequency interval is higher it is like extra spatial surface area that is hidden in time dimensions, it is essentially a time crystal.

With the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation conjecture: Space ought seem to be moving more slowly at the center of a large mass like the sun, as it has more time area to move through, conversely space ought to seem to be increasingly faster in the spacetime field with distance from the center of that solar mass, this is because it has relatively fewer time frames or time area to move through.

Space appears to consist of a harmonic oscillating field of particles that can be classified as either energy or mass depending on their frequency or speed.

The fast movement of an electron mass in space ought to accelerate time around the electron which is what I think the magnetic field is, accelerated time, that has an attractive interaction because of Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation, while what is outside a particle mass is attractive, what is inside a particle mass might be repulsive. (Does that imply that the inside of the earth might be repulsive?) but I guess the density of earth's crust is technically repulsive in effect isn't it? We think of that as pressure, so could the center of mass in an electron be considered to have the effect of pressure (keeping out other particles). Does the pressure effect inside an electron's area increase when the electron is accelerated?

The energy state is mass times the speed of light squared, in other words particles classified as energy have a faster apparent velocity. Imagine the higher speed of energy, relative to mass, indicates particles moving through space that have higher frequency but lower time area, conversely imagine that the lower speed of mass indicates particles moving through space that have lower frequency because that space has higher time area, or more time frames to travel through, so the apparent speed, or relative speed of mass is lower to the speed of energy.

# Note: a0253z quote:

“I share these references to Time crystals & new phases of matter that act like there are two time dimensions to point back to my Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation theory.

“Except that I am arguing that all mass is essentially a time crystal, including quantum particle masses.

“With Time Dilation time is slowest at the center of the gravitational mass where the frequency of mass or in other words where the density of mass is the highest. (evoking a reference to the inverted relationship between magnitude (space time amplitude) / frequency of mass (the density of mass))”

“in a nutshell the idea is that in open space the chances of a particle moving in any direction is random, but if mass is nearby, then the chances of the particle moving in the direction of mass are increased BECAUSE, the particle treats the extra time dimension as extra space area, and if you roll the dice, the extra spacetime area gets better odds than the areas with less mass that have less spacetime area. It's kinda like saying gravity isn't an attractive force, so much as its a more statistically significant spacetime crystal for the otherwise random movement of particles & atoms & objects”

There are several equations that have been proposed relating to the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD) theory proposed by Micah Blumberg 

You can paste the equations that are below into this link to see them rendered correctly.
https://www.symbolab.com/


1. One equation relates the mass of a particle, its frequency, and the number of time frames in its vicinity:
 
mc^2 = \frac{h}{N}f

This equation suggests that the behavior of a quantum particle is influenced not only by its intrinsic properties (such as its mass and frequency), but also by the structure of spacetime in its vicinity (as represented by the number of time frames). This is a significant departure from standard quantum mechanics, which treats spacetime as a fixed, unchanging background.

2. Another equation modifies the Schrödinger equation to include a time-scale factor that varies with position and time:

i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right]\psi(\mathbf{r},t)

This modified time-dependent Schrödinger equation that incorporates the time-scale factor N[r, t] could be written as:
$$
-\frac{{\hbar^2}}{{2m}}\nabla^2\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) + V(\mathbf{r}, t)\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = i\hbar N(\mathbf{r}, t)\frac{{\partial\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}}{{\partial t}}
$$
This equation is similar to the standard time-dependent Schrödinger equation, but with the time derivative on the right-hand side scaled by the factor N(\mathbf{r}, t). This factor represents the local scale of time, which varies with position and time.
The solution to this equation is:
$$
\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{{2\hbar i m N(\mathbf{r}, t) \frac{{\partial\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}}{{\partial t}} + \hbar^2 \nabla^2\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}}{{2mV(\mathbf{r}, t)}}
$$
This solution suggests that the wave function \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) evolves more quickly in regions of space with more time frames (i.e., stronger gravitational fields), as indicated by the factor N(\mathbf{r}, t) in the numerator. This is a significant modification to the Schrödinger equation and would have profound implications for quantum mechanics if it were correct. It suggests that the probabilities of different particle trajectories could vary in a way that mimics the effect of a gravitational force.

3. A third equation relates the energy of a particle to its frequency and the number of time frames:

E = \frac{h}{N}f

The proposed equation E = \frac{h}{N}f is a modification of the Planck-Einstein relation E = hf, which is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics. In the Planck-Einstein relation, E is the energy of a photon, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the photon. This equation shows that the energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency, which is a cornerstone of the quantum theory of light.
The proposed equation introduces a new term N, which represents the number of time frames. This is a novel concept that is not part of standard quantum mechanics or general relativity. The equation suggests that the energy of a particle is inversely proportional to the number of time frames, which could be interpreted as a form of "quantum time dilation".

4. A fourth equation relates the mass of a particle to the number of time frames and the frequency:

m = \frac{h}{Nf}

This equation is a speculative idea that suggests a relationship between the mass of a particle, its frequency, and the number of time frames in its vicinity:
$$
m = \frac{h}{Nf}
$$
Here, \(m\) is the mass of the particle, \(h\) is the Planck's constant, \(N\) is the number of time frames, and \(f\) is the frequency of the particle.
Please note that these equations represent a mix of established physics (the Schrödinger equation and the time dilation equation) and speculative ideas (the new equation for Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation and the equation relating mass, frequency, and number of time frames). The speculative ideas are not currently supported by experimental evidence and would need to be tested further.
