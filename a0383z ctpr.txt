(Thalamus, cortex)
Not just the detection of coincidences but also the detection of breaks in the regular rythum of coincidence patterns.

New concidences, or new patterns.

It takes many neurons to register what a single neuron has seen.

Because a neuron transmits what it sees.

It's a change detector.

Basically by new patterns.

It takes many neurons to register whatever a single neuron has seen.

What is the real way that the thalamus sends the perceptive signals to the cortex so that I could emulate that?

Bioelectronics.
