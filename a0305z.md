# "Spontaneous Spiking Is Governed by Broadband Fluctuations"

"fluctuations can be seen in the local field potential (LFP), which reflects summed return currents from synaptic activity in the local population near a recording electrode."

"the phase of narrowband oscillations is often correlated with cortical excitability and can relate to the timing of spiking activity and the fidelity of sensory evoked responses."

"neural activity may be fundamentally broadband and composed of transient, nonstationary rhythms that are difficult to approximate as oscillations."

"the instantaneous state of the broad ensemble relates directly to the excitability of the local population with no particular allegiance to any frequency band."

Wow! Is there perhaps no inherent preference for any part of the frequency spectrum in theory? Why then do areas in the brain seem to have regional preferences for power band spectrum? Perhaps it's just about the 3D morphology of the brain and the sensory inputs that cause the appearance of powerband preferences.

I suspected that the types of neurotransmitters in each area could also be related to regional power band frequency preferences.

"These results challenge the view of the neocortex as a system composed of narrowband oscillators and supports a view in which neural activity fluctuations are intrinsically broadband."

That's what the theory of Neural Array-Projection Slice Oscillating Tomography agrees with.

"broader representations may provide higher fidelity in describing moment-to-moment fluctuations in cortical activity."

Broader representations meaning the slower tonic frequency band, exactly what Neural Oscillatory Tomography predicts.
