a0322z Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation Tension

Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation, originally named Quantum Gradient Time Dilation, is connected to MOND Modified Newtonian Dynamics, the Tully-Fisher Relation, Galaxy Rotation Lines, Flat Rotation Speed, Mass to Light ratios, and Hubble Tension (which is about variations in the measured rate of cosmic expansion between measurements that differ in terms of the objects measured.)

This is a note about the shape of space that attempts to connect the theory I came up with that I call Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation with MOND Modified Newtonian Dynamics and Hubble Tension which is variations in the measured rate of cosmic expansion between measurements that differ in terms of the objects measured.

If the universe has a shape I would first imagine it as as linear graph with X, Y, Z dimensions plus time, and I would imagine the edges bend into corners, and these corners are blackholes, planets, stars, and any vortex such as an atom or a person, they, the masses of vortices, are pinching the graph grid together, and they also defining the parameters of it's expanse. The mass and the space around it are relative to one another, part of a single wave, with the mass part representing the smallest part of that wave, and the most distal reach of space representing the largest scale of that same wave. The rate of change in mass is going to be relative to the rate of change in the expansion of space, so objects with different mass properties will create a slightly different rate of space expansion thus explaining the Hubble Tension https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hubble-tension-headache-clashing-measurements-make-the-universes-expansion-a-lingering-mystery/ and connecting Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation Theory to MOND Modified Newtonian Dynamics.

Perhaps the space of a galaxy could be imagined as balloon relative to some blackhole, in four dimensions. I'm imagining a bell curve where in the middle the expanse peaks, while the concentration of mass peaks, and then the trajectory of both reverse, with the expansion of space reversing as the mass decreases.

For mass the front of the bell curve could be its acceleration towards it's highest velocity and it's hottest state, after that peaks, after the mass begins to cool, the gravity of other masses, if in range, exert forces on it that slow it down (an idealized situation).

This means that the acceleration & deceleration of space expansion is perhaps not dependent on missing dark energy, but instead it's relative to the effects of four dimensional mass, and there there are the lingering effects of mass that was, and perhaps we see effects on space from mass that will be. The argument that mass that no longer exists may still be exerting effects in space is not new, and the same concept would apply to energy, it could be that dark energy is carried over momentum from energy that no longer exists. The idea that energy and mass that does not exist yet from our perspective might be exerting forces on the universe that exists now is a strange idea but it's no stranger than the felt effective of magnetism, if you consider that the force of attraction between two magnets emerges when magnets are brought together, because of the alignment of charges in the magnets, and it doesn't exist before that moment, so in this sense for a future force or interaction to move the universe, whether that is a future mass or a future valence of energy, it could be argued that the alignment of individual cosmic scale dipoles, galactic dipoles, relative to other galactic scale dipoles, is one possible source of gravitational expansion and or contraction of galaxies and or space.

"Einstein, however, introduced the concept of time as the fourth dimension, which meant that space and time were inextricably linked. His general theory of relativity (opens in new tab) suggests that space-time expands and contracts depending on the momentum and mass of nearby matter" https://www.space.com/time-how-it-works

What are the precise numbers that describe how the quantity mass increases or decreases the volume of space (expansion or contraction) depending on how the mass is changing (in the context of Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation) (accelerating (in rotation, oscillation, or direction), decelerating (in rotation, oscillation, or direction), increasing in volume area, decreasing in volume area, increasing in density, decreasing in density). If mass is cold or hot, if it's dark or luminous, how does that affect a masses rotation in a solar orbit verses in a galaxy orbit? 

I haven't look at this closely yet but in Newton's Gravity...

# Inverse-square law
"Newton's law states: The gravitational attraction force between two point masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical quantity. "
Inverse-square law https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law

# Modified Newtonian dynamics
"Milgrom's law can be interpreted in two different ways:
"One possibility is to treat it as a modification to Newton's second law, so that the force on an object is not proportional to the particle's acceleration, but rather to ..."
"In this case, the modified dynamics would apply not only to gravitational phenomena, but also those generated by other forces, for example electromagnetism."
"Alternatively, Milgrom's law can be viewed as leaving Newton's Second Law intact and instead modifying the inverse-square law of gravity, so that the true gravitational force on an object of mass m due to another of mass M is roughly of the form..."

# Tully Fisher Relation
[Flat rotation speed is the measure that minimizes scatter to get high quality data]
[and with high quality data there aren't any credible deviations from the Tully Fisher Relation]

What I am thinking is that if you think about gravity as a wave, that is increasing in scale, that wave is going to have peaks and troughs, even as it grows in area as it increases in scale, at point you are going to round the curve of that wave, come down from the peak, at scale, and that is one aspect of my theory for why there is a flat rotation speed. 

A peak in the wave has been reached, and while the gravitational affect was decreasing with distance, it was also spacetime being amplified or accelerated for the length of the gravitational wave before the Flat Rotation Speed begins. At that point, when MOND theories and dark matter theories jump in, to try to explain why stars are no longer decelerating at the same high rate, my conjecture is that amplification of spacetime in time, which is described in Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation theory, is effectively no great than the rate of time in space without the gravitational effect of a galactic core. The gravitational affect from the galaxies center hasn't ended, it's just decelerating at that point, and accelerated space is now decelerating, and that change is compounded by the gravitational dissipation with distance.

I think what I am fetching for is that MOND occurs because past a certain distance space from the center of a Galaxy there is a threshold point where the temperature of space in the Galaxy suddenly drops, (the magnitude of time that creates gravity decreases, and the frequency of space increases or dilates like the concept of super fluid space, but only the concept) and that creates the MOND effect that describes modifies Gravity, and describes a formula that matches the orbit of stars in the most distal areas being able to travel speedily while avoiding having their frames being dragged or slowed by the center of the galaxy.

The Tully Fisher Relation is so consistent that it suggests it could be useful to question the math on mass to light ratios. Instead of adding in dark matter. 

However there is another issue, Tully Fisher says that Luminosity has a relationship with Galactic Rotation Speed, or the Velocity of Stars orbiting the center of a Galaxy. The brighter the Galaxy the faster it rotates.

With MOND Tully Fisher is predicted? (Is this correct?) because Galaxies are brightest in the center where they are fastest, and as we enter the region with flat rotation speed, there is a flatness in the distribution of brightness? (Is that right?)

Somehow there is supposed to be a mass to luminousity ratio that is most of the time 1/1 but can vary with the largest stars as much as 1/30 but this is supposed to be rare.

Yet in a solar system, with Kepler's law, we have the most distal planets rotating more slowly than the planets closes to the sun.

In Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation I argue that time itself is moving fastest closer to the center of the star, and slowest the more distal one gets from the center of a star.

At somepoint the mass of another star, burning brightly, is going to define it's own speed, by speeding up time in the direction of it's travel, as long as the mass is accelerating in time it's going to be giving off light, a cooling object, like a planet, will be slowing down, and if caught in the drag of a star Kepler's law applies. It's pace will be slower when it's distance is greater from the star, and cold matter will move faster when it's orbit is closer to a star, because the star is heating up space and moving time faster in a closer orbit.

Gravity from a star or blackhole is literally changing the temperature of space when it increases time, and the temperature drops with distance, past a certain distance the temperature of space as heated by the center of a galaxy becomes equal to the temperature of space, and that is another way to characterize the point when the peak of the galaxy gravity wave is over, and the flat rotation speed begins, at that point the center of the galaxy is no longer heating space to a degree that is hotter than the rest of space, and all the velocity of orbiting stars comes from the stars themselves, they are not slowing down because their burn rate, as illustrated by their brightness is the factor that is driving their speed, and those stars are affecting the speed of nearby stars. 

With Hubble Tension 

# "NO RELEASE FOR THE HUBBLE TENSION"
"Most measurements of the current expansion of the universe (called the Hubble constant, or H0) based on stars and other objects relatively close to Earth give a rate of 73 km/s/Mpc. These are referred to as “late-time” measurements. On the other hand, early-time measurements, which are based on the cosmic microwave background emitted just 380,000 years after the Big Bang, give a smaller rate of 68 km/s/Mpc."
"The first rung in the SH0ES method uses geometric parallax to double-check the distance to Cepheid variable stars in our galaxy, for which astronomers can also measure distance using their brightness variations. The second rung then compares Cepheids against Type Ia supernovae, another “standard candle” like Cepheids that astronomers can see to greater distances. The third rung compares distances based on supernovae and redshift measurements."
"In a Zoom webinar on December 9th, Dan Scolnic (Duke University) announced, on behalf of a collaboration between SH0ES and another group, Pantheon+, that the teams had obtained a new late-time H0 measurement with the smallest uncertainty yet. The result is posted on the arXiv preprint server. After much data collection and analysis, the teams still find the universe’s expansion is expanding at a high present-day rate between 72 and 74 km/s/Mpc — a much smaller range than obtained from their previous late-time measurements."

So what I want to know is there something wrong with our assumptions regarding the mass to light ratio. Can we check our calculations by presuming that the Tully Fisher relation is correct, and when we have high quality data that includes an accurate flatness distribution, can we use that data to (instead of trying to find dark matter) recalculate the light to mass ratio for that galaxy?

The dimmer galaxies move more slowly in my conjecture, as explained earlier in this note, perhaps because they are cooling, and their velocity is decelerating (either they are older galaxies, or younger galaxies at an earlier stage before their brightness & velocity peak.)

Also if the Hubble tension is off because of the different way we measure distances in space, then perhaps what it is telling us is that the rate of space expansion or contraction really is relative nearby mass, including the density, and the acceleration of that mass.

So if the mass of what is being used to measure distances is different, then the rate of the current expansion is going to be different, because the rate of expansion depends on the mass of the entity being measured.
