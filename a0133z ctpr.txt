I think some professional people have barriers in their thinking, like it seems sometimes that they can't relate one complex concept to another easily. when I see this I start to wonder what else could be going wrong in that persons mind, is there some powerful emotion keeping them from acknowledging some dark truth about some horror that they witnessed or experienced and the carrier over from trauma is this split in their ability to put two very complicated pieces of information together in a coherent way? If so would that mean that emotional therapy might unlock powerful new ideas for just about anyone?

But its almost like the benefit of the therapy is oscillatory synching
