The book description on amazon.com, I will need to update this again before the book is released.

Human beings are organic Sentient & Self Aware Neural Networks, meaning we are from a valid point of view machines, naturally evolved computational entities. We evolved natural neural networks ala brains, capable of rendering a depiction of reality to ourselves that we refer to as phenomenological consciousness.

I am releasing this now because the knowledge contained here within this book is essential for scientists & medical professionals to use to advance medicine, heal the sick, and solve some of the biggest challenges facing the world, such as the challenge of feeding the population, defending our global community from autocracy, and providing appropriate shelter for all human beings.

What is the entity that is you? I argue that entity of you is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in a 3D grid of cells, a rendering emerging from oscillating phase changes, with temporal/spatial configurations across the 3D brain. You are a pattern or a rendering emerging from a branching (or fractal) feedback loop (referring to how information flows in the brain) resulting from the brainwave synchronization of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes across this 3D neural-glial network grid resulting in the entification of you, the entity. You are entified via the principles of neural oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz, and the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single or unified sensor/transmitter/consideration/action system, a sensor system that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, in the book On Intelligence). I will attempt to explain how reality is computationally rendered from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, (a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains). I will argue the whole brain is doing this at all scales: at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

I also draw from books similar to the following, and from papers with authors similar to the following.

Someone sent me the link to the above paper after I posted my NAPOT theory in the deep thinkers group on Facebook. It is interesting to think about how we use various forms of Tomography in medical imaging. In this case they are correlating light microcopy (LM) with electron microscopy (EM), they are achieving knowledge with better trade offs using a multi-modal approach.

It's interesting because NAPOT, Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography is saying that the human brain is doing Tomography on it's own patterns, the brain is seeing it's own models of reality that the brain is rendering from sensory inputs, and internal cellular signalling traffic (aka brain activity) So on the one hand our brains are doing multimodal tomography on our brains inside our brains, and on the other hand outside our brains scientists are using multi-modal Tomography in Medical Imaging to study other brains to learn about our own brains.

# Medical Imaging Tech "Studying synapses in the human brain with array tomography and electron microscopy"
"Postmortem studies of synapses in human brain are problematic due to the axial resolution limit of light microscopy and the difficulty preserving and analyzing ultrastructure with electron microscopy. Array tomography overcomes these problems by embedding autopsy tissue in resin and cutting ribbons of ultrathin serial sections. Ribbons are imaged with immunofluorescence, allowing high-throughput imaging of tens of thousands of synapses to assess synapse density and protein composition. The protocol takes approximately 3 days per case, excluding image analysis, which is done at the end of the study. Parallel processing for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a protocol modified to preserve structure in human samples allows complimentary ultrastructural studies. Incorporation of array tomography and TEM into brain banking is a potent way of phenotyping synapses in well-characterized clinical cohorts to develop clinico-pathological correlations at the synapse level. This will be important for research in neurodegenerative disease, developmental diseases, and psychiatric illness."
