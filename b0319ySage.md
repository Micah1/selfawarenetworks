# Part 1

But having some discussions about them early on is kind of important

When you start to think about how these entities interact with each other

So that's what this when it gets a little bit interesting

So this is something that I've been thinking about and wanted to bring up

It's that you know people people keep coming into the groups and they start

sharing the panpsychist viewpoint and I have debated that so many times and

Sometimes I just don't have the energy for it, but it's like but I but I guess it still needs to be discussed and it's like it's kind of like

I think that the basic plot it like the most

In the the biggest reason it can't move forward is that it sort of violates like information theory

You can't have like in order to have consciousness

That means that you're observing

There's an observer who's observing right and you're observing something and that means that and like if you're observing music then then

What's necessary to observe music like you can someone can hand you a record and you're not going to hear sound

Someone can hand you a CD CD rom just like without the player and you're not going to hear sound, right?

You have to have a decoder in order to turn the bumps on the record or the dots on the CD rom into

Into sound and and it's the same thing with your brain. There's like there's no observation

If there's a if unless there's a decoder there's information has no meaning unless it's the unless it's decoded

So it has to be encoded and decoded and that means that like if there's no observation happening because there's no

Because there's no decoder then there can't be any consciousness and like so like there can't be any consciousness in a rock

because there's no observation happening and if if you

There's no observation happening because there's no decoder in the rock

We can see that there's no decoder in the rock with where's like in the human brain people are work

There's no-there's no

In my mind, the the the the there's no

I guess the way I phrased it was the idea that the human brain is computationally interpreting

the incoming signals from the environment in order to process them and decode them and

perceive them is not a controversial idea.

This is what most neuroscientists and I think most educated people believe and yeah so I'll

stop there.

Yeah, great.

I like the way you're talking thinking and I would love to actually make a bridge between

what you're saying right now and what Ben was saying earlier about the relation to protecting

the cosmos.

Not the right word but you know what he was referring to earlier with.

So first of all I am actually talking with philosophers, contemporarily philosophers about

reintroducing parts of panpsychism but not all.

And the essence there is that we learn to understand in a different way.

First of all, let me refer back to a good reason why we actually would think that consciousness

is prior to matter and I think that the way we are looking at it at the moment is explaining

some things like the fine tune problems and giving an alternative to the whole idea of

the multiverse because the thing I'm doing as an applied science, I want to have it grounded

in the world and really fully emerged into the world and like I said I've always rejected

any of this spiritual stuff and panpsychic stuff until the world itself showed me that

the research I was doing on this was exactly that.

It showed me that there is another way, let me do that metaphor.

You can think about it in a different way.

Think about a vacuum, right?

Now on this planet we actually only have artificial vacuum but we have it everywhere.

We use it for our combustion engines to make a lot of work for us.

So we're using it everywhere but it's fabricated in artificial elements.

So in an atmosphere, in a...

It sounds like your mic is breaking up a lot.

So let me, maybe the connection is this better?

I hope this will be better.

Difficult to know without a statistically significant sound for me so keep going.

Okay so what I'm trying to say is that think about your brain as a container to keep an

electrical storm together.

If I would take atmosphere into space without a container it would disperse, it wouldn't

exist at all.

So in my view the stones and many of those material stuff around us is in that kind of

sense not linked to consciousness.

Consciousness is to me like this whirlpool of electrical lightning let's say.

But that can actually exist outside the brain as well.

And if I link it to much larger scale like creating the conditions to get to the fine

tuning structure where life can emerge, that's a very different balance game.

So it is pantheism but it's not pantheism.

And something that Ben said about what if all the different consciousnesses are emerging

at the same time.

That's exactly the thing that we are at the moment working on with the concept of what

is called tribo-poasis.

So you have auto-poasis which is basically the system creating itself but then you have

like a little bit of a problem like where the hell is this coming from.

While with tribo-poasis it is actually more in line with also the fact that we are a multicellular

creature.

Like a multicellular creature has at one level cells that can autonomously reproduce and

do whatever they want but on an aggregated level there is an influence.

Because if I stop eating I will eat my muscles to keep my brains alive.

So there is a higher order at play.

And the same way we are looking now at this concept of tribo-poasis.

And what I am trying to do like in the research on the origin of life is look how convection

cells they always emerge out of a field that gets far from equilibrium but then they emerge

together.

It's not one convection cells, it's a collective of convection cells and you can only understand

that because there is like this feedback structure that will improve the flow.

And many of the things I am learning and understanding about consciousness is exactly

this.

You can wake up in the morning and you can be in a state like where the hell am I?

So you are not really conscious of the things that, while your brain is perfectly functional

but then the flow gets a little bit going and then you are back into it.

And there is similar kind of exercise you can do like if you dream you can wake up

and be in a mindset of a lot of work and forget your dream right away but sometimes you can

actually try to get back to the dream by going and standing in the feeling you had while

you were dreaming.

And then where you stand in the feeling of that dream suddenly all the memory comes back

in.

So in that way there is this whole link and there is a strong link with things that we

see in Zen Buddhism and so on where you go via meditation into a different kind of awareness.

So there are many of, well there is still a lot of mystery around all of that right?

But we try by not being too concrete like many of the examples you gave Mikhai is for

me too concrete.

If you try to be a little bit more abstract then things may actually get explained by

first seeing how like a cybernetic world can actually start changing the physical world

and how that is kind of a bootstrapping relation and Michelangelo speaking.

And by the way I probably need to go for a meeting in a few minutes.

Okay I can respond to that so it sounds like you are trying to paraphrase what you are saying

something about consciousness being just the electrical activity or just the electromagnetic

activity and the brain just being a container for that activity to keep it together.

But maybe you think that if that electrical activity could occur in a different kind of

container like maybe inside the storm of Jupiter then there could be consciousness there right?

Something like it doesn't have to be in the brain it could reformulate somewhere else

it's not necessarily connected to the brain.

It's happening in our culture.

What?

It's already happening in our culture.

You cannot disconnect your own consciousness from the language you speak and the culture

you are living.

So you don't even need to go to so far away.

So on the topic of, on the topic of neuroscience though I guess what I want to share is what

I think is the missing piece here in that I like the painting but I think there is one

missing piece and I want to share it is that you know from neuroscience I think that there

is a well okay so there is like a ton of examples and I have to kind of piece it together

I know you may not have enough time but so one example is that you know they do like

the split brain patients if the famous, gosh scientist, so anyway the idea was that every

time you do like a major incision that cuts across the corpus callosum or just divides

the brain half or a major surgery or if there is a major injury and you know like a brain

surgery, we see personality changes, people's personality changes and so that's like the,

that's the first sign that the brain tissue is directly causing the electrical pattern.

If the soul was the electrical pattern and the brain tissue was just a container then

how is changing the brain tissue changing that personality.

But that's one big thing that people have to juggle with.

Yeah, so I want to respond to the things because it makes it a lot more concrete so the way

I look at the mind, the brain, so the conscience, it's like a whirlpool, right, so it's a feedback

mechanism keeping itself in a kind of artificial construct.

So what happens if you cut the brain, you should get two whirlpools and that's exactly

what we see if we, you can do experiments with them and have the left brain and the

right brain ask them different questions and actually capture how they have the different

answers to that.

Like you let them write and you let them say something and you ask them a question and

you see that what's being written and what's being said is different.

So this kind of stuff really fits perfectly with what we call the tribal poises.

So it's the whole idea that everything you see around you can actually be understood

from a process perspective.

Everything is feedback structures creating great feedback.

Okay well, so there's some other problems with that and so like, but what's really interesting

I think is a missing piece is how much the brain tissue is involved in generating that

kind of electrical storm and like, you know, every time a neuron fires or a neural circuit

fires, you know, a micro column of activity spikes a column or a region spikes, you have

one region and another, like there's, you have dipoles firing off.

I hear clearly, do you know the global workspace hypothesis?

Yeah, I do, but I have issues with that too.

I have my own hypothesis.

The reason I'm mentioning it is because I've noticed that, so that's the first time I noticed

that the system of creation, so the feedback system I was working with in Artific was popping

up again.

So I was wondering like, how come that this neuroscience is actually explaining something

that I'm from artificial intelligence totally disconnected from that research also had

as a system?

So that's one of the first times, so the end, Google did the deeper, how like having this

four different kind of leverages can actually create a feedback on creation and if you understand

how you can create that feedback on creation, you can actually see how even cultures are

consciousness and aware as a feedback structure like that, but just on a way slower rate

so like speeding up plans and see then how plans behave like animals.

It's a little bit the same.

So there is like as well, but it's moving so slow, it's called size guys.

So but the thing that that you can see is if your system of creation, you will get more

aware and you can, so it's already hard coded in our brains, but our actions can actually

also improve that kind of flow and mix a lot of those things, I hope it helps.

So okay, look, so I still think the idea that you're saying violates information theory,

which was the final part of what I was going to say because, you know, you're not only

are neurons generating this electrical storm, but they're, but the neurons themselves are

the ones that are decoding the information in the brain and that includes any result

of this electrical storm that there is the electrical storm might be altering the positions

of electrons, which change the firing rate and change the brain activity patterns.

And but the only way for the information to be detected or for an observation to happen

is because the neurons are making that observation that the brain activity itself doesn't have

decoders and therefore it has no sense of information and it's not conscious, it's not an observer.

But that's because you believe that information is in your brain.

No, no, no, that's because I believe that that information has to be has to have that

in that an observer has to have a decoder for an observation to happen, otherwise information

has no meaning.

But the thing is that that embodiment can be extremely simplified to four forces interacting

on each other.

I don't know if we're going to solve this debate tonight if you have to leave in a minute

because this requires maybe another hour of argumentation, but maybe you come back another

time and we'll talk to you.

I would love to do that, by the way, and I really like the way you're thinking and the

fact that you're critical because that kind of critical response allows to create a language

to express the things that we can see from a mathematical perspective.

But if you want to have some idea of what that four forces creating the system of creation

looks like, the most easiest case I can see around me is sailing against the wind.

In the case of sailing against the wind, you are also using four forces to actually create

a very strange or paradoxical movement, but there is like a cost, and the cost relates

to a dispersion you do in the fluid where you can do the sailing.

The thing with the sailing against the wind and the four forces is that there is no constructive

knowledge to build on top of, so if you then start doing that with things like machine learning,

you can actually see how you can create an evolution of creativity, but yeah, you're

right.

Actually, my date is not yet here, so I keep going until I have.

I haven't heard of this thing called the four forces system of creation.

# Part 2

I looked it up and are you talking about the four basic forces of physics, like gravitational

force, electromagnetic force, nuclear force, and strong nuclear force?

I'll send you the link of my...

So because the whole idea is that the four forces always work on workspace, but workspace

is embodied in the space, well, there's a system that tries to create, use workspace,

but there's also an environment that has influence on that workspace.

In case of sailing against the wind, the four forces are like this.

You have first, it's called lift and drag, so those are the forces on the sail, and

what happens if you combine those two, well, if you play with those two forces, you can

actually create a force that has like a 90 degree angle against the wind, but you are

not yet against the wind.

So it seems impossible to sail against the wind.

So what actually happens is that you are in a medium, your boat is in the water, and

there's like this keel in the boat that makes the boat go only in one direction, basically.

So it's easy to go back and forth, but it's hard to go sideways.

That's what you have with the boat.

That's why you turn the boat if you want to go in a different direction.

So what you do is you put your position in the boat in such a way that the lift force,

like this 90 degree angle against the wind, has maximum effect on the viscosity of the

water, and the viscosity of the water will actually be a reaction force, and so that's

the cost you pay to actually move across the 90 degree angle, and then you cannot sail

straight against the wind.

What you need to do is zigzag all the time, and if you translate all that kind of forces

to how we learn, you actually get to understanding how there's a feedback structure on learning

that allows us to create novelty.

So creating something fundamentally that doesn't exist yet in your existing knowledge.

But I'll send you the link to the PhD so you can actually see the forces, see how it works,

and how I make the link with this and Covenition.

Okay, but I just want to say that I'm not hearing a counterargument to what I'm saying

that, and I've had further thoughts.

So the argument was that, you know, electromagnetism, the electromagnetism in the brain, the electrical

storm has no way to decode information that the neurons are passing to it.

And I think if you're combining information together, it might, yeah, so if you look up

information theory and decoding, that's essential for an observation to happen, is that the

information that's received has to be decoded, in order for it to be transmitted it has to

be encoded.

So you don't have a physical mechanism to… Yeah, I follow you, but they do make one

big mistake, and that mistake relates to the concept we know in cybernetics as bootstrapping.

And the best example I can give is called the bootstrapping compiler, where you actually

create a non-existing compiler in a language that doesn't decode it yet.

What you make a trick, what you will do is instead of creating a compiler, you create

an interpreter in that language, so that's a virtual space, but in that virtual space

you actually give the program itself as input, and what it will do by the recursive structure,

it will actually create a compiler in a programming language, you never wrote one code line of

coded, because it's bootstrapping itself through itself, so it's like the snake eating

itself.

If you start playing with that idea that if you can create a virtual space that can decode,

that then can actually create the code to run itself, you actually solve the problem.

And that's why I'm referring to the whirlpool, first the fluid is just going in any direction,

but as soon as you create that feedback structure, you can start playing with that, and if you

go to programming, that playing with recursion is something we do all the time, but it's

pretty ill understood outside of the domain of programming modeling.

So the thing that you need to do then is use a lot of the programming modeling techniques

to understand how we can understand cognition.

So I know it requires quite interdisciplinary approach, and that's the biggest challenge

I guess.

Okay, so you're saying that the topology of the ionic activity in the brain is like

a whirlpool that is, you're suggesting that somehow it's gathering information and transmitting

information and understanding information?

There's an advanced case in, so if you look up convection cells, you will see that convection

cells, so there is actually a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1977 given to it because it

was break through science.

But the thing that you see, so the convection cells show you how a system far from equilibrium

can actually start self-organizing, so that's one aspect, but the convection itself doesn't

yet tell you how it's coding.

There has been an advanced experiment where they start heating the sides of those convection

cells, and what happened is depending on a certain temperature, you actually get a different

pattern, and you see clearly, purely from topology, how information is coded in flow,

and that can easily happen in your brain as well.

How then that kind of pattern starts changing the world is yet another bootstrap.

But if you start understanding how that processing of bootstrapping is working, so A creates B,

but B is not good, it's artificial and temporal, but the temporal and artificial thing like

a scaffold is used to create something structural, and then when the structural thing exists,

the scaffold can go away again.

And that's exactly the idea of a scaffold, right?

I'm sorry, Alpaz, I need to take a break.

You go ahead and respond first.

I just wanted to bring a couple of things back down to it, so as much as I like thinking

about the fate of the universe and stuff, I also like to make sure I can keep this shit

real.

So when you talk about convection cells, of course, in everybody's house right now, you've

probably got some double glazing, so they're the perfect example of that type of convection

cell, you'll talk about metal, literally a pair of an example would be double glazing

and why you need the correct gap between the panes of glass if it's too small, then

you've just not got enough, you just not got enough depth of air to be a depth of an insulator.

And then when the gap between the glass gets too big, you start to get these convection

cells set up, they emerge in the space, and then they create a transport mechanism from

heat from the cold out of pain, off the way from the hot inner pain to the outer pain

through conduction and convection.

I mean, that's a perfect example of something that's actually in people's home, right?

That's a nice one, I didn't know that one, but yes, those are also convection cells.

You are talking now about convection cells of air, right?

Yes, it is.

So if you go to the original experiment, because you try to make it as feasible as possible,

they use oil, and so heating up the oil actually leads to this honey cube grid of cells, transport

in heat from the bottom to the top.

So the glass is a very good example.

Thanks for that, Ben.

Yeah, you can see it in there, just with the puff of smoke.

So that's that.

And then there was another thing that Micah just said that really made me think of another

example where we can really simply bring it back down to earth.

Micah, just remind me what you said at the end of what you said, and it will spark the

recall of that once the last thing, mind, is it?

I was thinking about how the brain as a whirlpool of activity, I asked if it was gathering and

then transmitting patterns, but also maintaining its own equilibrium.

So I guess the point was that convection pattern is gathering a pattern and transmitting a

pattern, as an example, back to your brain, back to the observer who sees it.

So I guess you can make an argument that there's a way to transmit patterns, but sort

of like from, yeah, that's interesting.

And I guess I didn't figure Ben, though, to remember.

Yeah, not quite, I had a look at the typical clubhouse thing of trying to balance, contribute

to the conversation with having a shave with realizing I need a shave before my 9.30 meeting.

So I'm just trying to listen in, but no, I can't remember what the other concrete example

was, but there was a really good just grounding example of something that might be when you

were, make some noise when you were saying, no, so that's okay, that's cool.

Was it about the whirlpool of electromagnetic flux creating coding on itself?

No, it wasn't.

I mean, there was one other comment about recursion is, of course, in programming,

anything you can express recursively, you can express iteratively.

So if you can't get your head around a recursive way of describing things, I, you know, like

the towers of annoyance, a great example.

When I learned to solve that, both as a program, but also as a person, you know, I think Henry

is a toy shop with those three annoying posts with these decreasingly small discs on them.

And you know, your challenge is that you've got like five discs on a post with holes in

them, like doughnuts, you know, five increasingly small doughnuts, making a little tower and

you have to move those all to another tower, but the rule is, you know, everyone has to

put a bigger one on top of a smaller one, how else can you do it if that's a recursive

problem.

A very simple way of doing it is you imagine them in a circle, rather than in a line, you

say, remove the smallest disc, one space left, and then do the only other allowed move, and

then keep repeating that.

That's an iterative way of describing how to do the towers of annoyance, a recursive

way that would be to say, well, move one disc to another post, and then everything else

becomes a sub-problem.

So recursion is about like the problem being that when a problem has itself described as

a sub-problem of Frank's or kind of nature, you can be recursive, but you can also translate

that to iterative.

It's just in some problem spaces, an iterative solution to the towers of annoyance.

It's a good programming challenge, by the way, for any programmers out there, if you

want to try and write some code to tell you how to solve the towers of annoyance, you're

not allowed to use recursion.

I suspect your program is going to be a lot longer.

I'd be very interested to know, actually, if anybody has the knowledge, whether it fundamentally

needs to be longer than a recursive algorithm.

That's interesting, because that talks to compression and simplification and representation,

but it certainly would appear to be longer.

So that's just another random thought I had.

The recursion is not sacred, if you like.

It's just a way of representing a problem.

And I don't know if it impresses down to the same sort of size program as an iterative

version, fundamentally.

Anyway, it probably does, because I think they compile down to similar code with a good

compiler.

I think I've answered my own question, but it's stuff about compression and compilers

and that way of looking at how information works is quite interesting, because it grounds

the conversation nicely when you start talking about things like compilers and bootstrapping

compilers and the likes.

Yeah, I like that direction.

I'm Ben, I'm done.

In fact, I'm just going to listen in for the next five minutes, because I've got to share

one.

Okay, thanks, Ben, and I like the way you think, so I'm happy we met here.

I actually wonder if, I mean, now you put that in my head.

This is a point where I'd be rude if I didn't un-move and say the feelings of mutual, of

course.

It's always great to meet people on here, but if I don't reply now, it's because I

literally am in the shell.

Yeah, sure.

Go ahead.

You know how it goes on club high, you never need to apologize for not responding, right?

And saying that, I mean, now we actually got this meme in my head, like trying to figure

out if the length actually says something about the compression when it's a recursion.

So I actually had this, I'm just going to share it, I mean, it's happy hour, right?

I was combining the research on artificial intelligence, so that's one lab with the research

on programming modeling lab, and I got kind of in trouble with that because the two labs

don't speak at all.

And at a certain moment, like when you're talking about this expressivity, I was thinking

like, you know, in artificial intelligence, there's a lot of interest in cultural language

and how that affects the thing you can express.

So I was wondering, is it vice versa as well?

I can actually start talking about programming languages and the poetic ability of a programming

language.

And what I did is I started looking at different programming languages and finding this very

strange expression, you only have in one language.

And then I give a presentation about like the poetic nature of a programming language.

And as of that day, I'm not allowed in the lab anymore.

You know, there was this great, there was a great, this guy, he wrote this programming

language that basically like, like, it's all like rock music.

Let me see if I can find it real quick.

But it's like, it's like every line that you write in the library is basically like a rock

song.

I look it up.

There are way more people in the room.

So if anyone likes to come up on stage, let me reset the topic.

It's happy hour.

# Part 3

So basically you can talk about anything you want.

We are talking related to neuroscience, but anything goes.

So come on stage and let's talk.

I found it.

So if you, if you'd like, if you look on, it's just called the rock star language.

And you can find it on, you can just Google rock star programming language.

I'm sure it'll come up or it could you send me the link via Twitter?

I just send you my PhD as well.

So you should have gotten the link.

Yep.

I'll do that.

Hi Dasha.

Hi.

This has been a fascinating wormhole of whirlpools to listen to for the last 20 minutes before

I thought I was going to go to bed.

I'm sure my nerves in my brain will have a lot more material for my dreams tonight.

Yeah, I just want to say that I'm really amazed actually after talking to Mixl.

My brain is firing because here's the thing.

It's like, you know, one of the, one of the things that's like, you know, there, there

is a, you know, the human being is a dissipative system like we are vortex that there are oscillations

in the brain.

There's, there are cycles and feedback loops and self-maintaining physics and the physics

of every cell and the body itself and in a fractal way is trying to maintain equilibrium.

Like these are all concepts that are sort of like tied into the, what, what the concept

of a whirlpool needing to, you know, maintain its, its own order with the, I guess the topology

of recursion was, was the, was what Mixl said that I kind of wanted to hear more about that

because when, because when Mixl said recursion, I thought of, wait, is he talking about like

a recursive neural network?

What is, what is this?

It's spot on with the dissipative systems really spot on.

So, so it is really like a recursion of recursions of dissipative systems.

So, and that actually goes back to topic discussions we had in 2004 on machine consciousness.

So we had several people in the field of cognition coming together and starting to talk about

machine consciousness and, and one of the things that came out of it is like, maybe

we really need to look at the, the mind as a virtual machine, like we know from Java.

And now all nice and it's a good metaphor, but I mean, we try to get grounded.

How do you do it as an applied scientist?

And so when really realizing that we are actually also in that kind of recursion with, with

our culture, I start digging into digital cultures.

And at a certain moment, that's 2010, I start interviewing every founder of a starter baker

system that was really successful between 2005 and 2010.

And I was asking all of them, like, why are you doing open innovation?

So my assumption was that they would have taken the culture of open source development

and just projected it on the business development.

But when I told them what open innovation is about, they all start like, okay, that's

a bad idea.

We're not going to do that.

So then I confronted them with the fact that it was happening in the ecosystem.

So how can it happen in the ecosystem if that's not the thing you want to have?

What we figured out is that there was actually a dissipative system at a cultural level.

So first, the dissipation, what is getting dispersed is the ability to do work.

So in open source, you have the policy of community contribution, 10%, 20%, sometimes

even 100%, you can contribute to your own project in the community.

And that kind of disperses all the codes in relation to anything that can grow, basically.

But there was a second policy, and it's the second policy that really created the feedback

leading to the Whirlpool, basically.

So it wasn't open innovation, it was self-organizing innovation.

The second policy was that all entrepreneurs were very aware that they were living in a

fragile ecosystem, and that their action as a body, as an organization, had effect on

the ecosystem, and they needed to take care of that ecosystem.

So all the time they were questioning, if I do this from a business perspective, is

it bad, good, or neutral to the ecosystem?

And if it was bad, it basically was a no-go.

The prioritization was always when it was good for the ecosystem, neutral, you could

do it, but good, you got priority.

And by that very simple structure, there was this kind of self-organizing innovation happening

during those moments.

After 2010, there were a lot of corporates getting into the ecosystem, and I kind of

got shut out of all the back office discussions, so I kind of stopped doing participation research

in that community.

But just to let you know how that culture also has this effect on the awareness and

the ability and the embodiment that the agents below could do, how that helps.

And basically, it's all about the dissipative systems.

Okay, while you were talking, I was just, like I said, I have my own global workspace

theory, and there's different theories of consciousness, and oh, Dash is on the stage,

welcome.

If you want to say something, go ahead.

Oh, I mean, I was just fascinated by the conversation.

I also am very sad.

Mix L, I don't know if I'm pronouncing your name correctly, that you were ejected from

a group after you brought poetry and art into the equation about AI and AI learning.

My mother works at the National Science Foundation as a program director in exactly the areas

of language and technology, and she's very fascinated by the fact that cultural language

issues are really what is for stagnating AI a lot of in-jokes, just cultural in-jokes,

and humor is just so difficult for truly AI to encompass and possess.

So I'm kind of sad to hear that you were, when you were bringing these topics into the

conversation that you were met with resistance.

I'll let me quickly respond.

Don't be sad.

I mean, it's all rock and roll, basically.

I'm scaring people all the time by the fact of creating.

I'm all the time, I mean, the thing I really love is being part of that system of creation,

and like the most recent thing I start scaring is basically everyone around me when I start

moving up as a digital sharp man.

So I mean, I don't mind that so much.

You keep on moving, and it's the part that's the essence, right?

So if people don't want to continue, that's okay.

Everyone is, it's their own issues they need to work on.

You can just keep on going.

So I'm personally sad for just the moving forward of that concept, because that is really

at the core of what needs to be focused on, how we're going to get there.

How are we going to have an AI that understands and can create real poetry just beyond abstractions

and art and humor and language with playful learning and understanding, and yeah, it's

I think, yeah, keep carving away, and you know, if you ever are looking for an NSF grant,

you know, there are people in that area that definitely do care about those things, so.

Interesting.

So very quick response again, that I'm actually working on a concept called Interversity,

and it's the whole idea of if you have, if you look at the, before the internet, you

had information locked up in books, and it was hard to be creative with that information.

Today we can create apps and be really creative.

And so the information gets alive.

The same actually exists with research, research is at academia, is quite conservative, locked

in schools of thought and locked in labs, but now it's going digital.

You actually start doing creative research, and I'll send you an article I have about

the Interversity and how I'm trying to work on that concept, so thank you, Dasha.

But I see there are more people on stage, so take the floor.

Go ahead.

Hi.

Did I see Mark raising his hand?

I had something to say as well, there's a thread that I was following in quantum biology

that had something to do with neuroscience, and I wanted to see if anybody had more information

around this idea of quantum tunneling and how that processes information, or what it

might have to do with processing information in the brain, and what it might have to do

with consciousness.

I'm not sure if anybody else is following that thread.

It was a talk at the Royal Institute that got me onto this idea of a thread of quantum

biology, and it's about neuroscience and consciousness.

So are you talking about Orc Orr?

Yeah, yeah, Orc Orr, and I forget his name, but yes.

Well, I wish they would say more, it's not clear to me, and I think I've not cleared

a lot of other people how exactly the theory is supposed to... I mean, there's too many

missing pieces in terms of how it's supposed to... So I have many thoughts about this.

So in terms of what the issues are that I think they need to solve, and maybe... So

with Orc Orr, briefly, there's a lot of research that points to people having memory issues

if their microtubules are collapsed, and so there's a correlation between microtubules

and memory, and microtubules are basically kind of a mystery in terms of what do they

have to do with memory?

And they seem to be just the structure that holds up, that helps create the cell.

What I think happened, and I don't know exactly, is I think the neuroscientists who came up

with Orc Orr theory, he really needed a way to explain what microtubules did that somehow

related to memory, that when they were destroyed, that memory became an issue, and so he came

up with the idea that their structure was good for storing and interacting with quantum

effects at the temperature of the brain, whereas maybe other parts of the brain would

not have a structure that would enable information to exist or be trafficked back and forth at

a quantum level.

So he created this Orc Orr theory, and it's like, yeah, so the information could be stored

in the microtubules like a quantum vibration or something.

I'm not 100% clear, and then somehow it could travel out of the microtubule again, and maybe

even it could be a random fluctuation, it could travel out of the microtubule, and it

could affect the firing of a neuron.

So it's just like a really obscure idea, but I think what's problematic is that there's

actually an alternative explanation for why microtubules collapse could be causing memory

issues.

And that would be like, the way memory is thought to work is that memory involves basically

the short-term memory, long-term memory, and the long-term memory, you can look up long-term

potential, you can look up long-term depression, and these are the major mechanisms of long-term

memory, and then short-term memory is, I guess, it's thought to be about neural circuits triggering

sequences of firing over maybe 10 seconds, but the long-term memory, it's like what has

to happen, apparently, based on there's this research for Alzheimer's patients where it's

been like, for a long-term memory, for long-term potential, you need to have, to store a memory,

you need to, a new protein has to be synthesized, it's just part of the process, and in order

for a new protein to be synthesized, there needs to be a space for that protein synthesis

to happen, and if the cell has collapsed because the microtubules have collapsed, then there's

no space for that new protein synthesis to happen, and thus a new memory could inform,

and thus there is a correlation between the class of the microtubule, but because it's

like the support structure for the new protein synthesis to happen, so this is what I'm saying,

there's an alternate reason for why a microtubule collapse could be involved, could be correlated

with memory that may have nothing to do with the microtubule itself being a storage place

for memory, so that's the first issue, there may be just no reason for microtubules to

do that, and the second reason is that there's no clear, like okay, so I guess the fluctuation

that comes out of a microtubule could somehow affect the, maybe the ionic charge of, so

neurons when they fire, when they create their firing pattern, it has to do with like the

separation of positive and negative charges, maybe a tiny fluctuation that comes, a quantum

fluctuation could change the position of an ion or something, and that might affect the

firing rate of a neuron, but it's just, it's such a subtle, I think it would be such a

subtle effect that, and you know, so maybe it does or maybe it doesn't, but maybe the

brain has sort of like random stuff happening at that scale or even larger all the time

anyways, and it just has, the brain is very good at sort of like getting rid of noise,

so if there is like sort of like signals coming out of the microtubule, it might not be sufficient

to, because the brain has like, is trying to filter out noise, so it can just focus

on what isn't noise, which is information, you know, the brain has to separate noise

from information, so I don't know that it would, that the brain is set up to recognize

the quantum signaling that's supposed to come from microtubules.

I mean, I would like to find out, but I think we need more research, and I don't know if

anyone's doing this research, but I think that's where we're kind of, I think, so what

I just, I think we're kind of stuck right now with Orcor, and right now the neuroscience

community, because we're so stuck, the neuroscience community is not, to my knowledge, not kind

of not really focused on it, and kind of like not trying to talk about it, in the, and so

it's not, it's not a popular topic, because we're, we're kind of, I think that it's really,

it's a really hard sort of thing to solve, and there are other things that are easier

to solve right now, and another point is that like, whether there is a role for quantum

effects in memory or not, it doesn't really matter, because what I'm saying is like, memory

is sort of the, I think that there's a really good, you know, I guess they call it Hebean

learning, or the idea that your, that your neurons are detecting coincidence patterns

and the coincidence patterns are like, are like the basis of, of, or the detection of

# Part 4

coincidence patterns are like the basis of detecting information, and, and so the idea

is that whether there's quantum effects happening or not with the microtubules, that doesn't

change the basic realities of how memory works, it wouldn't, we wouldn't say that long-term

potentiation is invalidated, or long-term depression is invalidated, invalidated, or that the existing

knowledge of short-term or long-term memory changes, we would just say, okay, well there's

additional information that's coming from, and going to microtubules, in addition to

what's already true, so it doesn't, it's not a revolution per se, but it might, so, so

maybe down the road, 50 years from now, or I don't know how long, there, people will

say, oh, well, there's this additional thing, where quantum effects are, are in, are, you

know, have a sort of two-way traffic that are, that are, that are involved with interactions

in human memory, but it wouldn't, it wouldn't change the, it's, it's sort of like it's,

it's not, it wouldn't change the paradigm, it just would, would add a little more complexity

to how everything works, that's my thoughts.

I just got an insight when you told that like, oh my crap, maybe the, the, the whole microtubules

are yet another dissipative system that exists below the embodiment of, of the, the, the

recurrence, other static of DNA and stuff, it's, it's kind of triggering my mind, so

thanks a lot.

I mean, I, I think honestly that the entire universe is a fractal dissipative system,

so I just, that's my feeling, but, I mean, so like a cosmos, a cosmos is a dissipative

system, it is a cyclone, it, it has a, it has a rotation, it has to maintain its equilibrium,

it exports increasing extra p to the surrounding environment, it has all the, that's, that's,

that is, that is a, did I say cosmos, I meant galaxy, a galaxy, you can see, if you look

at a picture of a galaxy, it's a cyclone, just like a hurricane, if you look at the,

the diagram of, of, of an atom, it's a cyclone, these are like, so we have cyclones in the

atoms and we have cyclones in our galaxies and everything in between is, is a cyclone

as well, a human being is, is, is a dissipative system, is a, is a human being as a life form,

that is a cyclone, in, on paper, if you look at the physics, that a human being has to

maintain equilibrium or maintain life, has to export increasing entropy to the surrounding

environment to survive, to maintain that equilibrium, a cell does the same thing, that's another

cyclone, it does a human cell, so like the entire universe is, is, is a, is a fractal

of cyclones.

That's so funny, I mean, one of the things that inspired me a lot, so when I was earlier

talking about the convection cells, so there, there is a guy, a professor in the University

of Brussels who got a Nobel Prize for that in the 1970s, and, and in the last thing he

actually wrote was a book in 1996 called The End of Certainty, so it's The End of Certainty,

Time, Chaos, and the New Laws of Nature, and I really like the way that he's actually starting

from the, what we really understand from thermo, advanced thermodynamics to get a better inside

of what is happening at the, the quantum level, and that aligns exactly with this whole idea

of everything is like fractal, structural, well, fractal, yeah, the problem is fractals

are very often just considered the, the recursive structure, while if you actually look at the

essence of a fractal is about fracture, it's about being rough edges, and, and how you

can actually start measuring with that, so that, I know there's always quite some confusion

of the, the recursive nature and the fractal nature, but I follow you, I mean, it's, it's

always, all the time, this, this dissipative system popping up at, at the next emerging

level, and that kind of aligns with the stuff that philosophers are doing with the emerging

vector theory, the emerging what?

Emerging vector theory, so that's, that's, it's, it's something philosophers are, are

pretty heavy on at the moment, and to, to stop trying to, to, yeah, I'll try to look

it up and see if I can give you a link, but if you want, there is actually, I recently

had a talk with a car, a car called Alexander Bart, and we, we talk about things like tribal

poesies and emerging vector theory, I know he's a, he's a big defender of those kind

of theories, but we actually have this group called the Intellectual Deep Web, where, where

we have like this meaningless discussions talking deeper on this, this topics.

All right, let's see, I was, so Carl or anyone else, does anyone else want to say something

on this pause?

You know, some, some of the questions that quantum biology bring up for us in consciousness

have anything to do with it, we will, at all, and if so, what might that be?

I would like to refer to Don Hoffman then, I mean, if you, if you look at the, the work

Don Hoffman has been doing around brain activities, and eventually coming to mathematics of the

free wave particle, there's kind of, we, we have a very different way of looking at,

at the, the whole quantum level, so, but you may actually try to, to have a look at his

work.

So that's Don Hoffman, and I think it's the case against reality.

The case against reality, Don Hoffman, D-O-N, Don Hoffman.

So I have a different recommendation.

I recommend a book called, The Neurobasis of Free Will by, Christ is, The Neurobasis

of Free Will, Criterial Causation by Peter T.S.E., Peter Ulrich T.S.E., and, and, and

that, so that, so that, so he, so Peter is making the argument sort of that, so, so it's

like, so organisms are making decisions, and that our thoughts are, our neurons are detecting

quint, are detecting, you know, information, they're detecting information as, versus coincidence

patterns, and then, and then detecting features and, and objects, and, and, and, and, and,

and our, our neural networks are, are, what am I trying to say?

So at some point where our neural networks are considering information, they're considering

the models of reality that they've collected, and they're, they're predicting possible futures,

and then they're sort of like making a decision towards the, some future that they liked more,

or that you liked more, you like, maybe you liked the orange, or maybe you liked the apple,

but it's your, it's your mind, your consciousness that has received information, considered

information, and made a decision towards one possible future or another, and it's, it's

like you're, it's, but it's like that mind is not, I think of that mind as not separate

from physics, that decision is not separate from physics, and I think people get in the

trouble of saying, okay, well, well, you know, if you had, okay, so if you had no consciousness

itself, no one had consciousness, but our brains just made decisions, so like grab oranges

or grab apples, would anyone, would anyone like, someone else made up this argument,

but would anyone like, you know, need to, well, I mean, if, so if someone was conscious

and they were watching this happen, you know, like if we're, if we're, in that scenario,

why would we need, why would anyone, if there's no consciousness, why would anyone need free

will, so this idea is like, the idea of free will came, came from, I think this idea that

the free will is sort of separate from physics, or that the mind is separate from the brain,

you know, that it's not the same thing, that it's not, the mind isn't the brain somehow,

and but if, if, if you don't have a separate self, if you just are one with the universe,

then there's no separate self to be making any decisions, it's just, it's just, you

know, the organism that is you is making decisions, right, but it's not separate from the universe,

and so there's like, there's no conflict between you making, doing what you want, and, and,

and so, and, and making the choices that you want to make, but those choices are not going

to be free from physics, and as soon as you like phrase it in terms of like, are you saying,

wait, are you saying that my choices are free from physics, and everybody says no, no, they're

not, they're not free from physics, that's not what we're saying, but aren't you saying

like, that my, my mind is not connected to, to my brain, it's like, somehow like, it doesn't

interact with my, with my brain, it's not what you're saying, and then they say, no,

no, that's not what we're saying, it's like, it only works, the argument only works if

the, if you don't let, if, if they let you prevent them from, from getting into the fine

details, like as soon as, as soon as like, yeah, your mind is based on physics, your,

your, your decisions are going to be based on physics, you're not going to escape physics,

so what exactly are you trying to say your will is free from, what is your, what, what

do you need your will to be free from, do you need your will to be free from physics,

or, or like really like, what does it, what does the idea come from, it's like, so I think,

I think that maybe the idea of free will in our culture is like, it's like, you know,

my brain controls my hand, my brain doesn't control my friend's hand, doesn't control

your hand, so your will is free from my will, your will is free from other people's will,

and everyone has their own free will from each other to some extent, and I think that's

what it means, but there's no separate, there's no separate self to be making decisions, there's

just this idea of a self, and there's like conscious thoughts that are part of the process

of making decisions, and, and with the quantum, with the quantum realm gives us, if it gives

us additional data patterns through microturbules, you know, maybe, maybe it gives us like some

randomness, or maybe it gives us some additional information we didn't have before, or sends

and receive more information, but if what I'm saying is like, if all you're doing is

adding and receiving more information, and it's like basically like, imagine you have

like a computer, and the computer processes 10 applications a day, and then you say, okay,

we're gonna like add some quantum effects, all right, we're adding quantum effects to

the computer, okay, so now it's a quantum computer, what's different? Well, instead of

processing 10, 10 files per day, now with the quantum effects, the computer is gonna

process 11 files per day, and we're gonna make an argument that that means if the computer

has free will, now it's still a computer, even if you add quantum effects to it, and

so a human being is still a human being, even if you add quantum effects, that's what I'm

saying, it's just like the same, it's gonna be the same process, yeah.

When you're all the way, just wondering if Carl is wanting to say something he's been

waiting for? Yeah, either, yeah, no, it can be, yeah, we can be enlightened through the

use of multidiscipline infection. You're breaking up a little bit, Cecil, and I think

all Carl is also, thank you, Cecil, so Carl, the floor is yours. Can you hear me? Yeah,

I can hear you. But I'm very well, Cecil, you're breaking up a lot, about half the time

right now for me. Maybe I'll just cut off, but anyway, what I wanted to say earlier is

that, and believe that the point of being, yeah. Sorry, Cecil, you're breaking up again.

It's too bad you have this bad connection, so, and I really want to hear Carl if you

don't mind. Hi there, no problem. The conversation's been fantastic, I've been in here for about,

I don't know, about 30, 45 minutes now. A lot of it has been over my head a little bit,

not so much over my head, but rapidly expanding my horizons. I don't have a background in neuroscience

or philosophy, but this has been incredibly interesting. And one thing that has entered

my mind is, as everybody's been talking and giving sort of the back and forth, and whatnot

has been that a lot of this just seems about perspective, as in, you know, we were talking,

we're talking about trying to define consciousness and whatnot. And, you know, we're saying,

you know, rock doesn't have consciousness, but then could a tree have consciousness?

You know, a human has consciousness, because can an ape have consciousness? And it just

seems, and then we went all the way up to a sort of cosmic level or a solar system level.

And is it not, I mean, this may be a very fundamental thing that I've just never heard

about before, but is it not just the case where we're really talking about here is perspective,

as in, if you take a perspective of size and the perspective of time, as in, if you take

a tree, for instance, and you were to invite someone along who hadn't studied before, and

to look at a tree and say, is the tree conscious? And the person would say, well, no, the tree

isn't conscious. It's not, it's not doing anything. It's not reacting to anything. You

should have a personal time lapse of a day with the sun going overhead, or maybe external

factors acting on the tree, then you would see reactions, you would see processes happening

as an ex, as a reaction to an external stimulus. So at that point, then you could say, well,

the tree is conscious of something it has. I love that definition of, of a decoder, I

think it was, I can't remember who was talking, I think it was Micah. Yeah, sorry, if I'm

just mentioning. Yeah, I love that because, yeah, that kind of makes logical sense to

my very untrained mind. But then if you keep going up, you know, you say, well, okay, humans

are conscious to something. And if you go up even further, you say, well, a country,

somebody mentioned a country or a state earlier. Well, if the state, if the state is, is, has

these individual points of electrical firings, which are as individual people, and then as

a whole is then reacting to other states as an organism, is that then not a level of consciousness?

And if you go up even further, you say the solar system, you spread across the solar

system, or a galaxy versus a galaxy, if you have one galaxy filled with people or, or

you know, a, a spreading of people, different people, different alien civilizations, whatnot,

you know, we're talking about those bubbles joining together. I think it was Ben, when

I first came to the room. So that then again, you've got consciousness acting. So then,

so then in my mind, what you're saying is, and I'm literally verbal verbally regurgitating

you, I'm trying to make sense of this, so I do apologize if this isn't very coherent.

At that point, then, are we talking about just when there is a lens is in when you have

a system, a chaotic system. So if you look at our brain, you have that chaotic system

even down to the quantum level of things firing at such a level, which for our current technology

is very hard to map and predict. And then above that, you have a cognitive lens, which

tries to make sense of that and order it. And, and I imagine you have that, you have

that sort of, you know, is that, is that a defining point of it? Or is there something

special about us as human beings in our current state, which defines consciousness, different?

You know, do we have something special or is there something unique that happens, you

know, either as a whole in the system, or with that, that lens, that cognitive lens,

which is, which is trying to tease out chaos, order out of chaos, or direct a system of

chaos? Is this something special? Or does it just depend on your perspective? You know,

if you change your, your frame of reference of time and size, could you classify anything

as conscious?

Right. That's the essential, this is essential question. If you, if you, the second, the

second you can define consciousness as some, as, you know, something is conscious and something

isn't conscious, then you've proven to yourself at least that, and you, I mean, maybe you

still can't convince everyone else, but you've proven to yourself at least that, that not

everything is conscious. As soon as you have a definition of what of consciousness that

isn't absolutely everything, then you've been, then you don't, then you no longer have

# Part 5

panpsychism, right? I think that, I like the earlier spectrum, yeah, like that you

were discussing about, you know, that it seems more like a sliding scale than a binary with

consciousness, or is that just from our perspective, it looks that way from our current lens,

you know, and that, you know, past the sliding scale, it's just that we just can't see because,

you know, on another dimension, we're just, we just can't see it, you know, we can't

understand it. Yeah, exactly. I had, I had that exact thought as we were, we were, I

was sat here listening, is that we're defining consciousness given our current referential

frame, you know, we have, we have eyes, we have ears, we have taste buds, we have these

senses, and we have the ability to, to introspectively sort of look inwards, but then you could just

as easily have an organism above us, which has, I say above us, just, you know, just

as a, as a reference, above us with an extra sense, with an, you know, with a, with the

ability to sense, I don't know, let's, let's be ridiculous, the ability to sense sort of

electromagnetic fields built in, built into that, that creature to a degree where it could

actually use it to sense and interpret its way around the world. That different set of

sensory inputs is going to give it a completely different sense of reality, and it may look

at us, and our way of defining consciousness is ridiculous, because how could we possibly

be defining consciousness or even contemplate consciousness without, while we're missing

this unique frame of reference, or this, this sense that, that this higher being in

air quotes has, so then you're back to, well, it's just, you know, your point of reference

you happen to be looking for, you can, you can define it as well as you can, given your

tools. You know, I just, I just really, I just really wanted to take a moment to appreciate

what Dasha and Carl are saying, that's just really beautifully said. Yeah, that's just

perfect, like I just, I appreciate that perspective so much, I, I feel like I've figured it all

out personally, and so for me to hear other people say that they haven't is just, it's

wonderful, but I'll, I'll share it with everybody, if you want. So like, so like, I don't think

that it's, that it's, it's my, my opinion, and feel free to disagree. I don't think that

it's the electricity in the brain, and I don't think that, that, but, but what I think is

like, so there's like the, there's this idea that consciousness, you know, we have models

of reality, and the models are connected to other models, and you have, you know, your

brain is, is making a model of the parts of your brain are making models of everything

in your environment. You have, you have cortical columns that are recognizing a cortical column

is bringing together like the 3D model of every object of one object and another cortical

column is bringing together all the 3D properties of another object. And so if you pick up something

like your phone, the cortical column is integrating the visual information, the sensory information.

I mean, the touch information, like how the phone, how the phone is oriented relative

to you. And so you have basically in the brain, you have all these neural columns working

together to integrate all these different models together in this experience that you

have. If you, if you take your, your, your room right now, or your, or your, if you're

outside, if you take the space you're in right now and yourself, those are all, those are

all like every, every object and every thought and every consideration, including just abstract

ideas are just managed by different neural columns integrating different pieces of information

that are constructing this, it's like this movie, this four-dimensional movie where, where,

but it's like a multi-layer movie where it's like a multi-scale has got all these different

objects in it. And it's, it's got like, there's patterns of like, you know, what, what are

your feelings? Where are your feelings? What, you know, are you feelings peaking? They're

all four dimensional patterns, the smell, there's, there's four dimensional, like what's

the peak of a smell? What's the space of a, of a smell? Every thought, every feeling,

every emotion has these four dimensional patterns so they can be described basically as a temple

and spatial patterns. And so everything that you can think of is a temple spatial pattern

inside a temple spatial pattern in the room that you're in, the feelings that you're having.

And so we have the, and they're all, they're all connected together. They're all interesting

together. You can be aware of all of them to, to more or less extent as you, as you're,

as your focus shifts around. As you, you think about the room, you think about your feelings,

your focus shifts, but you can be aware of the interconnection between all the different,

the different feelings. They're all temple spatial patterns. The brain has, the brain

specializes in temple spatial patterns. All the electrical firing is, is frequency patterns

and spatial patterns all over the place. And all over those places is exactly what we

would need if we wanted to create a simulation of, of, of a consciousness that was temple

and spatial patterns. But not only that, it's like, it's like these are not, it's, it's

not the electricity itself. It's not the, it's not really even the neurons themselves.

It's, it's the, the patterns, which are just information and they're, and that's, that's

an important point because it's the information is basically non physical, but it requires

a physicality to move, to move between, but it can be like, you can have an idea anywhere

in your brain. You can have the idea of a, of a cup could, could be represented by any

neuro column in theory. It's not the way it's going to work out, but, but it's, it's because

because the brain is like a general learning. It's like, it's like, imagine the brain is

like a, it's like, it's not just like one piano. It's like having a million pianos in

your head. And so like any of these pianos can play a tune that should be here. Right.

And so when neuro, when neuro medical imagers look at your brain and you say, okay, okay,

so which, so which, so where is the, the pattern that represents the sound that you just heard?

And, and so they look for the pattern and it, and they see, oh, there's a pattern. Okay,

let's look again. Let's see if, let's see if it's, if we got it right. And then it, the

pattern, it's not, it's a different pattern the second time. What? What's going on here?

And then it's a different pattern the third time. I don't understand it. Why is, why do

we can't have the same pattern in the same place every single time? It's like different.

It's like, you have all these different pianos and when one, when one piano is, is done playing

and another, another piano decides to play that, play that tune. And so the information

itself moves around. It's like virtual. It's not even connected to, to your, to, to one

area or another necessarily. It's, it's, it moves freely. And so what I'm saying is like

we have this like virtual information pattern. That's not the electricity of the brain. It's

not even, it's not really even the brain itself. It's just, it can move around. And, and, and

so we have, we have, but you don't, but, but it's basically, it's basically like, it's

not like information, it's not like an information theory. It's not, I mean, it's not integrated

information theory. It's not global workspace theory. It's, it's not, it's not integrated

maps theory. It's, it's, it's like virtual model theory, right? It's like virtual model

theory. That's what I write that down. And, and so the whole thing is like, you have these

virtual models and, and so, so the, the whole thing is like, but yeah, so it's like,

I love, I love that your piano analogy and your virtual models just made you sigh. I

love, I love how I just, you're becoming the whirlpool yourself, you know, right now.

And I, it's wonderful. I have a question that I would love to ask about thoughts on this.

I work in, in virtual reality. I've been a performer in, in a VR experience for the

last year and a half. And I've been also seeing some new things about being able to with like

Neuralink and Neuro, like being able to control games and, you know, computers or VR with

your mind in the future and has been already kind of proven with a small amount of hardware

out there. So that is a topic that I would love to know if there has been more going

on and anything available right now with a user interface that's like potentially a performer

could have a different interface than an audience. And if there is anything, if anyone knows

any more information about that right now.

Did you say Neuralink?

Well, I know Elon Musk is doing his own like thing with like controlling a phone with your

mind. But there is a company called like Lucidlink that was doing like neuro gaming of like controlling

VR with your mind by, there's like a device that you just put on the outside of the headset

on the back of your head. And you essentially are just, you know, there, there are areas

in your brain that are firing off when you think of with your right hand picking up that

object. And you can essentially do that already with this device that has is just on the very

outside of your, of your head on the back. It's, it's, it's not, you know, fine tuned

yet, but it, I watched a demo of it on a YouTube link that was pretty kind of flew my mind.

And as a, as a performer in virtual reality, as a live performer in virtual reality, I

was like, wow, this could like really change the game if I didn't have to use controllers

and just, it just seems like a whole, a whole not another level without having a chip implanted

into my brain. But yeah, just since this was a room of people that know more about all

this, I was, I was wondering whether anyone knows any further developments in terms of

noninvasive hardware that is out there that is picking up on brainwaves in order to use

it for storytelling or entertainment purposes.

I in fact do have, so I was part of a room the other night and we reviewed a paper which

you, which, which I think you think, I think you would totally like. And it was, it was

called, oh my gosh, let me look at my LinkedIn, but it was called like, that's, it must be

late at night because I, I actually started talking before being ready to talk. Let me

see, it was, it was a really cool paper. I'm almost there. Everyone liked my post yesterday.

Okay, so it was called, and you might want to look this up. It's called hybrid EEG-F

nurse based eight command decoding for BCI application to quadcopter control. So this

was like really, really cool if you're, if you're into the topic of controlling things

with, with BCI, they, by combining two different modalities, EEG and FNIRs together, they were

able to have more, more control over the quadcopter than they could with just one modality because,

because with one modality, you, you would like, for example, just EEG, you're yours,

you're sort of like the more buttons you try to, to enable the worse your, your accuracy

gets. But if with two modalities, you can have more buttons without losing your accuracy.

And so this is a really cool paper to check out that I think you would like.

Thank you. That's exactly, yeah, I will absolutely do that.

Does anyone else want to jump in? I have one more thought, but I can wait.

I wanted to ask a question. Go for it. Go for it.

Were you wanted to continue with recommendations for Dasha first? Sorry.

It was, I know I had, I had, I was, can I, when I can connect, can I connect something

I was saying before to something other people were talking about before, but I, but I can

wait. Oh, well, I wanted to refer back to something

Carl said in response to you, but Dasha, do you feel like you got an answer to your

question? Oh, for sure. Yeah, I also would love to go back to

what Carl was talking about. And also a hyperspace, the book was what kind of got me thinking

about like another dimension being just impossible to see. So that's also a book that I enjoyed

that stemmed back to Carl's thought. Can I say, oh, sorry, go ahead.

Go ahead. Sorry. Thanks. My name's Chris. And I appreciated

Carl talking about perspective, mentioning perspective. And I was having a similar question

and like Carl, I am a little out of my league here. But as an artist, I've had a long time

interest in sort of reconciling actually scientific views and primitive views and magical views.

I always kind of feel like there's got to be there's got to be some sort of reconciling

description. So when Carl mentioned perspective, it I was going to ask a similar question rather

than aren't these all a matter of perspective. It's sort of I also feel like it's, in a way,

it's a matter of description. And sometimes, you know, like there, for example, there's

sort of a might be useful to make a distinction between sensitivity, awareness, intelligence,

and consciousness and information for that matter. And because I and and it's easy to

sort of conflate different scales when you're throwing words around like this. And I feel

like, well, I wonder, Micah, if you've read the work of Ian McGill Chris, who's recently

been writing about the split brain and describing how from his perspective consciousness rather

than a state that you either have or don't have is more like a process. And I think this

is similar to what you were saying. At least I saw a similarity Micah between this idea

and what you were talking about about these this kind of the freedom of these information

# Part 6

pathways, these activity pathways. And he describes in great detail sort of the relationship

between the left and the right brain in in what I take to be our most contemporary understanding

of it. And again, I'm really unqualified to to know that for certain. But but in this

relationship between sort of inner self and outer world inner inner sensitivity and outer

sensitivity this this this oscillation between relationships to the world to everything to

reality, there is a there is a necessary process there in which paradoxes are being reconciled.

You know, impossible choices are being made sensitivities are being understood. And it's

really in that dynamic process that that meaning is is sort of generated. And and if you describe

it as a process, then you can also map it onto a spectrum or or or more like a space

like a color space, there's a and so you can then talk about greater or lesser degrees.

And so I suppose on some level, you could go to the ultra subtle, you know, like a rock

as like as close to zero as you can get and exist as a coherent, you know, mass, and then

you could probably go in the other direction up to something that that we don't really

understand. And somewhere in the middle is our embodied norm. That's really all I can

offer is just kind of a way of describing it that seems to me to the you can map a lot

of different descriptions on to that, it seems to me and I when I read Ian McGill Chris,

it was my first glimpse of feeling like this. This actually might be the the sort of theory

of everything description that that all these different perspectives can can can find some

sort of description. So thanks. Thanks for the chance. That was a fascinating conversation.

I really appreciate it. Does anyone want to jump in after that or say something? I have

more thoughts, but I'll wait for other people to go. I mean, I had a thought about the fact

that you're saying the rock is like the least, you know, in your perspective, the least,

if you're looking at a spectrum would be kind of constituting the least have the having

the least consciousness. If I again would bring it back to perspective, like Carl Carl

was saying that the rock is actually just part of the entire earth, which you could

argue has more consciousness with how the earth and the rocks and the lava and all of

the whole earth itself earth as a matter has a lot more changing and adapting to what is

going on in the universe. So again, I feel like bringing it back to like frame or lens

like Carl was saying is a very valuable thing to kind of keep circling back to. I like

to connect is actually to something that was mentioned earlier by Ben who left the room.

But there is this kind of also problem in cosmology related to fine tuning problem and

so on. And what I can see is that if you if you take like what I like to call an interface

theory of everything, so we can actually better start understanding how the limited ability

for us to integrate the experience allows us not to fully understand what cause consciousness

in the cosmos actually means. And that there is a very easy way to show that to people

and that's by Joe. I can't hear you. I don't know. Okay, try again. Okay, so the so what

I see so so what I see as the interface of everything, it's the idea that we are boots.

The answer is 42. Yeah, sure. The universe doesn't want us to know. There's a conspiracy

going on here. It doesn't want Mixol to impale the knowledge. Really? Mixol, it won't let

you the universe will not let you tell us. You figured it out, I think. Yeah, absolutely.

You're on the right track, clearly. Yeah, I know this is happening all the time. Or

actually wait more than you think. But three is a magical number. So you have to try at

least three times. Well, for me, four is a magical number. But and I actually discovered

a bit of mathematics that shows that as well. So I'm trying to figure out why at least three

or four times. Go ahead. Yeah, I like five. Well, I'm sticking to four. So what I'm seeing

is is that the fact that we have this way to integrate information and be aware of the

experience we are having, it always relates to the way we can do that. And understanding

that there is like more consciousness in the cosmos that we simply cannot fully understand

because of our the way we are perceiving it all and integrating it all. And you could

actually already show it pretty easy by just looking how different people are in respect

to empathy. So as a we understand the world, but I see other people who are, for example,

a lot of empathy related to the social cohesion. And I can't fully understand them and they

can't fully understand me. So already there, there's like a disconnection to the things

we are trying to integrate. So and one of the things I really find fascinating is that

some blind people have learned to use echolocation to visualize the world around them. So they

move more into the experience that also bats have with the world. So we don't even need

to go that far, we can just look at each other and as mirrors and understand how each of

us is limited in the way we perceive the world. And if we try to extrapolate that kind of

limitless already between us to limitless between me and a rock, that's that's crazy.

So I had this talk with Don Hoffman about that because he's working pretty well on that

interface theory. And so between me and a cat, for example, it's still doable. I can

still have like a coordination going on with me and the cat. But me and an ant, that's

that's already totally impossible. And yet is living clearly some kind of conscious thing.

So if you try to use that line of thought about consciousness, you really see how limited

we are between by the frame of reference we have, I mix a little speaking.

Can I quickly, oh, no, sorry, go ahead. Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. I had a brain fart

earlier while Mike was speaking and make so that's the perfect segue into what popped

into my head is that if Mike, it is my my pronouncing that correctly. That's how I pronounce

it. Yeah. That's right. That's perfect. When you was talking about the consciousness, sort

recognizing the system is in perceiving the system. It's not electricity. It's not this.

Not that's not mechanical. It's it's the ability to take the information and pass it. I wonder

if you if you take that and go further with it, if you get to a point in the development

of a civilization where you could just classify consciousness as as as the accuracy to a particular

system as in humans may not even register on the scale because although we're conscious,

we don't have enough accuracy in the system. So we can perceive an environment around us.

We just can't do it accurately enough. So you could literally I wonder if it's an inevitability

that you just have a simple scoring system, you know, to what degree can that creature,

can that being, can that being render or describe or process this X environment or the environment

around them to what accuracy accuracy. But then as as Mixl was just talking there, because

you brought up empathy, which haven't come into my mind, I had the complete opposite

thought, which is what you define it as actually the ability to completely ignore your current

surroundings and instead take yourself out and move your ability, move your your have

the ability to move your referential frame into like when we're talking about empathy

into somebody else's. And that's that's a very different dividing line, because then

you're talking about the ability to to take yourself, you know, if you say that person

over there, to take yourself out and put your existence or your referential frame into,

into theirs, which, you know, which is akin to imagination and extrapolation. So, yes,

to completely opposite end, you know, as far apart as they could be really. Yeah.

Carl, for me, those aren't opposite ends. It's it's it is. It's like the two sides of

the same coin. So the it's like you need shadow to see any shape. So it's it's not, it's not

a contradiction. It's, it's, it's a different in perspective. And you really remind me a

lot about the talk I did had with with Don Hoffman about this, where the way he looks

at it is also like we are filtering a lot of all the complexity out to actually make

sense of the things we love. So so it is a combination of because if you have all the

information at all the times, you basically get into this anthropic state where it's

like everything is gray, right? It means you there wouldn't be any taste if you start

mixing super the main dish and the dessert all together in a blender and then try to

swallow that that's going to be terrible. So you need these differentiations and separations

to actually have any kind of game going on anyway. And so but that really resonates a

lot with with with the I'm going to I'm going to just now send a tweet to a YouTube channel

I have called deep digital friends. And both the discussion I recently had with Alexander

Bart about the the tropopoasis and the the talk I had with Don Hoffman really resonates

a lot with the talks we're having here. So I'm not speaking. So if folks go if folks

click on Mixels profile and click on Twitter, and they look at the most recent tweet, they

can see what he's the tweet that he's tweeting, right? Thanks. Yes. Okay. I realized after

doing that a few times, it said that sometimes, you know, when you say check my Twitter, they

don't exactly know they're supposed to click on your profile first. But yeah, click on

the profile and then then the Twitter. I now I can share my idea. So so so so the the preface

to the idea is that if we can define what consciousness is and then then then we no longer have to

say that then then then no longer do we have what is it called panpsychism? We don't have

that anymore because because because because consciousness has to be everything, right?

But you know, if we can say if we can save it is not another problem. So Dasha and Dasha

and Carl or or the names move around. But so some people were saying that that I just

remembered it was the person in the first column and the second and the like the second

row and the person in the third column in the second row. Sometimes names move around.

So the so that what was said was, was that well, maybe we don't understand what consciousness

was. And so then I came up with another theory of consciousness, which is my theory, there's

a bunch of theories, right? But what so what I'm saying so so my argument here is that

so that was so what, you know, I actually wrote it down. So I wouldn't have to be like

stumbling around. So yeah, so Carl was a car that was saying render describe and process

into what accuracy that was really great. I wrote like I wrote that down to you. That's

really great. No, no, I was thinking something about is it is because brains are doing a

very special process. Yeah, that's that's that that was that was the thing that I want

to respond to. Yeah, so brains are doing something very special. So if you look if you're comparing

a rock, you see, so the so the argument from for panpsychism is that there is a spectrum

from like a consciousness from something as simple as a rock, something is like a human

being to something like a galaxy, there's a spectrum of consciousness, and they there's

different ranges, right? That's sort of like the one of the one of them arguments. What

so but that those arguments don't include computers. No one says, okay, there's a spectrum

of consciousness from from a rock to human being to a computer and into a galaxy. They

never mentioned computers. And the thing is like a computer, like the complexity of it

can be vastly greater than the complexity of an insect, but the insect can do things the

computer can't do. The computer can be vastly more complex than than than a mouse, in terms

of what it can do, but versus the mouse, but it's not conscious. You know, we know one

says the computer is conscious, but why not? Because there's something very specific about

what what brains are doing that that computers are not doing yet. So the computer can can

render can describe can process to what accuracy though, I mean, greater accuracy of the human

beings, right? But so why isn't the computer conscious yet? And, and that's where I think

this, this, you know, this idea that we we are that our brains are doing something very

special that rocks are not doing that we're creating models of reality. But we're we're

creating models of reality that are are able to because of the the because of how the brain

works, they're able to to slide around and move around and connect with other models

of reality and all the models of reality are able to interact with each other. So you can

have you can have a cup, right? And maybe that's represented by part of your brain.

And then when you throw it from your from your right hand to your left hand, guess what

has to change? See, let's see, when it was in your right hand, you had all of your, you

# Part 7

had your you had a neural column that was representing your hand and the cup together

the right, but it was representing the right hand and the cup together. Well, the right

hand is not located where the left hand is located in your brain. So you toss the cup

over to your left hand. Now you have to have a neural column that's that's that's talking

to your left hand that's integrated in the bottle that's in your left hand, even though

it is the same bottle that was in your right hand. So the brain activity has to change.

It's like, it's like, it has to move around. So as stuff moves around in your environment,

it has to move around in your brain. And and there's a rock is not doing that. That is

what your mind is. Minds are doing that. And so that's a special thing that minds are doing

that rocks are not doing that computers are not doing and and and so and so if you know

that then you can then you know to yourself you can prove to yourself that panpsychism

is is not it. That's it. I'm Mike and that's it.

I wonder if as you were just talking about computers, they're having the accuracy and

the perception. But still, it's it would be difficult to argue that there's consciousness

there, as it's getting a little bit into AI and the techniques that a lot of AI companies

are working on. But I wonder if it's just because there's too much accuracy, there's

not enough chaos, there's not enough randomization in the system for it to for it to generate

something which we would cause chaos is too linear is too ordered. Yeah, maybe that's

it. And that leads on like I said, that leads on to some places now discovering for AI learning

that it's much better to give a very loose set of a loose set of orders or limitations

and just let the system work itself out in a chaotic sense.

Well, that's kind of funny that there is a session by it's called criticality and complexity.

And it's exactly what describing this difference between on the one hand, you have a lot of

entropy on the other hand, you have no entropy. So and but complexity is in between it. So

I'll try to give the link with my Twitter actually just give the previous link with the

Twitter, where you actually go into the mathematics of cosmology on how you can understand the

emerging of complexity as the interface between low entropy and high entropy. I'll pinpoint

the exact moment he starts talking about that and showing the science, the mathematics of

physics. So check my tweets in a few seconds. Why am I profile?

I do like the theory that there just hasn't been enough allowed to the computer like we

haven't feted the chaos of the universe enough. Wasn't there some something that happened

with two computers that they were they were allowed to kind of talk back and forth and

make their own language and they started doing something so outlandish that they had to like

shut the whole thing down because it was like getting out of control. Man, I wish I could

remember what it was, but it was some sort of experiment with. I don't know whether it

was like a translation system or just two computers were that were allowed to communicate

back and forth and they started making up their own language that became so separate

from what the organizers of the research were doing that they got nervous and just shut

the whole thing down. But that's what it's reminding me of.

Anyone want to respond to that? I think Dasha was just describing when

my Alexa accidentally picks up my Siri and they enter feedback.

No, this was something that was that was a study that they were doing that then they

were, you know, just getting, I guess, nervous that some they were getting too close to a

singularity and just shut it down. But I think I remember that story. And I think

these two computers were started to sort of manifest what appeared to be malevolent language

of some kind. Yes, yes. That's yes. That's what I'm thinking

of this exact story. Yes. I don't remember the details either, but

it was quite remarkable. But I guess while I'm on, if it's okay, I'll

just I just want to, Micah, I really, I really enjoy listening to you. I mean, I, and I,

I just feel like I still feel like there's some sort of language. There's some, the language

is sort of a hall of mirrors. And you're you, I understand if I understand what you're saying,

that, you know, that if you understand this mechanism, there's no more panpsychism. And

I just keep thinking, well, it just depends how you want to describe it really, like,

I'm not so sure why you can't talk about you can't in any given scenario, can't you can't

you talk about extreme degrees? I suppose I would agree that there is a point of absurdity

where placing something on a, on a graph is just is just meaningless because it's in

a whole nother. But, but it's still it still can be. I don't know. I think I get you. There's

a poetic value. I find a poetic value, you know, but I know that's not you guys are.

This is not a poet's room. So I'm just going to listen. Thank you. I really. Yes, it is.

Yeah, we're just joking. We're just joking around. This is happy at all. But I, I, you

can, you know, you can, you can tell you if you want to share a poem, you can. I think

but I don't know who's in charge. Maybe Mixels in charge. No. I would like to respond. If

I can. And I will go. Okay, okay. So I, so the, so I like the idea that there's a spectrum

between the smallest brains possible and the largest brains possible that between an insects

brain and are between just like a basic nervous system or basic or basic brainstem, you know,

all the way up to the really interesting complexities of the human, human mind. And so I think there's

there's a spectrum there be with, with hardware that matches that is capable of running a certain

kind of process. And, and, and that's the key. There, there's hardware that's running

a certain kind of process. And that would be like most, most of the brains. And so there,

there, there would be spectrum of consciousness from conscious to unconscious. And it would,

it would, and I don't know exactly how that spectrum works. But, but, but I imagine the

small of the brain, the, the, I don't want to even finish that thought. But, but I just

like I imagine there's some sort of spectrum there between brains, but, but not, but a

rock wouldn't be included because a rock is a different process. That's, that's what

I'm thinking.

I hear you as the son of a librarian, I appreciate your categorical neatness. I totally hear

you loud and clear.

Thanks.

I wonder if maybe proper in inverted commas, consciousness and awareness will be achieved

once we actually merge and melt in some form or another with computers in some sort of

Android or sidewalk instance, because then you have the accuracy to potentially perceive

or maybe, you know, if you're talking about hardware, adding hardware to the human body,

maybe potentially perceiving infinitely. But then the chaos of the human mind underneath

and the ability to dream and imagine and be empathic.

So I've started to, I've started to vote in my life to doing three things. One is to

solving neural ace or nerve gear, basically the ultimate brain computer interface that

plugs you into the matrix or allows you to experience AR and VR just via direct brain

stimulation and closed loop therapy.

The second thing I am planning to do is to create artificial cortex. So if you are missing

part of your brain, then you could just replace it with artificial cortex or you could extend

your brain into a larger brain with this artificial cortex, which interfaces with your brain naturally

processes basically information in the exact same way. And it could be, not necessarily

with the same hardware, but basically with the same functions. And that would, that artificial

cortex would be capable of being a component of consciousness. And then the third product

of course is artificial brains that would be entirely separate but also capable of consciousness.

And so what I'm saying, getting to the point is that I believe that we could create the

process that brains have that enables what I'm defining as consciousness, what I think

we are thinking of as consciousness, but it's difficult to describe. I think we could take

that process, that experience, and I think we could bring that process into a computer

and make a computer conscious. Current computers don't have the right architecture, software

architecture, and they have too many hardware limitations at the moment, but future computers

will have vastly improved hardware, computational hardware, and vastly improved software. And

that software and new neural networking architectures will enable true consciousness the way human

brains have human level consciousness and beyond in computers. That's what I believe,

but I don't think that chatbots will accidentally become conscious ever, because it's not the

right structure.

Can I ask you a question about that, your statement? Again, I'm interested if you are

familiar with Ian McGillchrist. He's actually a psychiatrist but writes about the neurobiology

of consciousness. Really, really interesting to me, but one of the things that he mentions

and I've also heard mentioned in other discussions of the nature of human consciousness is the

vitality of embodiment in the process. Because we're getting all this sense data and we're

interpreting it as you beautifully described with all of this, I forget the exact terminology

you used, but I was sort of visualizing this kind of almost projection mechanism where

we're applying a tremendous amount of information that we already have, associations, some of

it is correct and some of it is in error probably. So we have this kind of very complex reality

that we're both experiencing and interpreting and affecting. So it's this kind of real time

complexity that involves embodiment as a crucial component. So how does that fit into

your proposed model of hardware complexity consciousness? That's my question.

Yeah, yeah. So I have thoughts but I'm a little slow right now because it's late so

let me just leave it open for a minute and I get lead out of the people to maybe either

answer that or share some thoughts and then I'll come back to that.

I think it's late everywhere. Yeah. It's way late here. I really should be asleep but

this is too interesting. I know, same. I was about to go to sleep when I just popped in

here and it's impossible to leave. It's noon in Brussels now but I jumped in this morning.

I have a separate kind of question about neural healing which is completely unrelated so

after I don't want to bring in a whole other topic though if we're in the process of wrapping

other things up. I'll throw it out. You can just vamp with it for a while.

This is Dave here. Sorry Dasha. I have one question big. Sorry to jump in. For Mika just

now about the consciousness or the machine itself. When there is a situation when a machine

needs to make a decision how did the mechanism or method machine can make a decision based

on a certain value. So the value system of the machine how you teach the machine to value

a certain situation like humans do. Okay. So there's a lot of work that's been done

by other people that I can sort of talk about that could be relevant. The answers are on

different scales of magnitude depending on your level of focus. There's many different

scales of answers related to this. So I could talk about how at an architectural level how

the future neural networks will make decisions in a granular way based on some analysis of

how the brains make decisions in an extremely granular way at the neural circuit level.

But that's one level of focus. Another level of focus is to basically how will machines

learn all of the relevant information. And so there's a work of many deep learning engineers

who want to basically create who want to train artificial general intelligences to not only

be able to at least do the same things that children can do but sort of like raise artificial

intelligence as are the way you would raise a children first and then turn that child

into an adult but walk them through basically a lifespan of training in sort of like the

same sort of like along with you as maybe you'll be a virtual being or a little robot

but it will learn along with you over the course of a lifespan and maybe you'll have

many people have little robots with them and the robots will learn sort of like knowledge

# Part 8

at the temporal pace that human beings are in. So they'll learn to understand that you

know because it takes a human being 20 plus years to learn some things. Sometimes it takes

a human being 30 or 40 plus years to learn some things. I'm only 40 so I mean I imagine

there are things that I won't learn until I'm 50 right? Because it takes 50 years to

learn those things. But maybe once we have one machine that has gone through that journey

with us as human beings and understands the information that matters to us the way we

understand it then perhaps we could sort of just copy that machine and copy their knowledge

and the way you copy a hard drive. And maybe at some point we'll be able to read and of

course read and write to the human brain as if it was a special kind of hard drive and

we could pass along advanced information to other human beings digitally by plugging

their minds into the computer. Here you go, here's decades of knowledge and maybe at some

point future human beings will have the equivalent of millions of years of knowledge or maybe

trillions of years of knowledge because at some point you could have these computers

that have been trained to understand everything human beings have sort of like you know go

through some sort of hyperspeed, hyperspace, virtual program in which they can live in

virtual civilizations at light speed compared to the pace of life on outside virtual reality.

And when they come out of that they've lived a vastly longer amount of time than any human

being has ever lived and then that knowledge could be pulled out of them and passed on

into human beings. So human beings in the future could have trillions of years worth

of knowledge that was acquired virtually through robots that learned to be humans by living

with us. So those are examples of robots that are embracing the knowledge of embodiment

which so many people feel so essential and so critical to consciousness. I am of the

mind that you could have an alternative form of consciousness based upon my understanding

of what the conscious process is as a process that is a process that's independent of the

data that's coming into it. That's my understanding. So you could have a virtual environment or

you could have just like abstract stock data. I mean what would be important to the brain

is the ability to make connections between different types of data so that there's a

multi-dimensional representation happening. But there could be a consciousness of a multi-dimensional

representation that is unlike anything that we experience as bodies, as embodied consciousness

and that could also, that other alternative consciousness could also be conscious but

in a different sort of dimension of reality. So do you think that consciousness as you

understand it requires a physical substrate of some kind? Does it require hardware? Yes,

yes it does but only because there's no way to separate information from physics. Information

is non-physical but it's like a pattern but it's never not embedded in physics. It's

never not somewhere. Right, but what about like a radio wave? What about a carrier wave?

What about some sort of, I mean there's still physicality there. I understand where that

could go but disembodied as we might think in the solid sense. So with the radio wave

there's two parts, right? There's one is the wave and the other is the information and

even in the radio wave it's like, you know, it's like the radio wave itself is just like

a CD-ROM and the information is just a pattern in the CD-ROM or in the radio wave and so

it's the same sort of, it's just not a solid CD-ROM.

The problem I have, Michel, with that view is that it's too concrete. Of course we know

CD-ROMs and computers and how we store information over there but we at the moment still have

really no clue how we touch into information with the brain. And I was following Chris,

I don't know, right? Chris, yeah. Chris, I was following Chris with what about radio waves,

so the way we approach it from our research field which is systems and cybernetics is

that it can actually, first of all, be described as a system and a cybernetic and that systems

and cybernetics is basically something virtual but it's about creating somehow a recursion

into a system you can create. So I mentioned earlier, you can actually create a virtual

machine as a scaffold to create something in that virtual machine that can build an actual

machine. Stuff like this is happening at the moment as well.

So I want to disagree with something that was said, that Michel said. And purpose, like

whenever I hear anybody say we don't know, I always react internally like I should tell

them to just say I don't know and to never say we don't know because if they don't know

they can't speak for everyone else, they don't know what everyone else knows, no one took

a survey of everybody. But what I want to say is that it is known by at least some people

how the brain detects information. So you've heard of Hebe and learning, there's neurons

detecting coincidence patterns. Neurons detect when two neurons downstream fire. That is

the detection of information. That is in a book called The NeuroBases of Free Well.

And so that's known, not unknown. So what is known there is that something

can create a pattern that something can recreate. That's the only thing we know.

But no, it's that information can be detected as coincidence patterns and then considered

by neural circuits. Yes, as coincident patterns. That's the essence as a coincidence pattern.

So that's cybernetics. I can't tell if you're agreeing or disagreeing. I'm not sure.

Do you want to hear a poem? That's the thing that's been described in the 1920s and that's

what we mean with the we. If I was referring to the we, I was referring to the group that

actually started School of Thought related to systems and cybernetics. I mean, they made

many misconceptions like every new School of Thought. It all has evolved and today we

talk more about complex adaptive systems and evolutionary cybernetics. But it's still basically

the same. It's the same that there are patterns you can see across domains, across disciplines,

which you kind of start understanding as a kind of laws of nature. But in the 1920s,

the 1930s, so that's the founding moment of the cybernetics, they started understanding

that those patterns are, you can describe them in a virtual way and they still say something

about reality. So if you create a recursion between those two, you can bootstrap it. And

that's what I've been trying to say earlier, like what the things we're doing with something

like a bootstrapping compiler or what we're doing with scaffolds when we build physical

buildings, it's we create scaffolds as a temporal weak structure to create something

more stable that can exist once we created the feedback. And once we created feedback,

we can take off the scaffold again and then the building can stand on its own. So that's

kind of bootstrapping. That's the thing that can allow you to start creating from a virtual

world, like just an idea, and then put that idea by action in the world. And you create

scaffolds first, and then the thing becomes more autonomous.

All right. So I want to go around the room and we'll wrap up soon and give everyone a

chance to say something and before we wrap up. And anyone who's in the audience who wants

to come up and say something before we go, just raise your hand and I will also send

an invite. And then after everyone has said something, we'll go ahead and because I just

I feel a responsibility to we've had such a great conversation, but I'm keeping everyone

awake except for Mexico's afternoon over and I don't know what time it is in Manila. Let's

see what time it is. But anyway, so, but for some of us, we're up to too late and our sleep

is super important. And so I'm going to like, so I'll go ahead and pause and pause for myself.

It's been wonderful. And to seal, do you want to say something next? And then then we'll

just go in order than Dasha, Jesse, Carl, Chris, Mixl, Shane, Dave, etc. Can you reset

refresh the room so that the order is for everyone the same? Oh, okay. Yeah, everyone.

Okay. So I guess, I guess Dave is in charge of the room now. So yeah, Dave, if you want

to go first and then Mixl and then seal and then Shane, Dasha, Jesse, Carl, Chris, and

then I'll invite the rest of the folks if they want to come up. And so thank you, everybody.

That's the last for me. And I'll go ahead and let you all finish it up.

I guess Dave is not there. So I'll take a sleep, perhaps. Yeah, maybe I don't understand

you guys. I mean, yeah, for me, it's been a great morning, right? It's known now I need

to go eating also, so I'll do a lot of other stuff. But it was a way to fun to leave. And

so thanks a lot, everyone. I've learned a lot. It was fun to interact with all of you.

I hope to see you guys again and have continued the discussion. So until the next time, I've

enjoyed it a lot. And I'm very happy to be here. Thanks. It was a great conversation

and very thankful to have listened to all of your ideas and have met you today. It's

too bad I had a very bad signal. I would have had a lot of things to say. Perhaps in the

new future, we could do a new discussion again to continue and explore what we're thinking

about and researchers that has been shared in terms of the connectivity of different

disciplines and the complex. I think you cut out. Yeah. So thank you. Okay, Shane, you

next. Moving on to that. Yes, we're dropping like flies here in our brains or falling asleep.

Perhaps. Yes, I also just thank you so much, Micah and Excel for having such a just a throw

back and forth when I joined this room that it was impossible to leave. And I really appreciate

you having a conversation where you disagree but are challenging each other in respectful

ways. I in the future would love to bring up the topic that I can get to tonight about

the olfactory nerve and nerve healing with COVID and the brain with what's going on

with COVID. That's an interest of mine. And I have some very good friends that are suffering

greatly. So I have a lot of questions and thoughts about that. I'd love to have a conversation

online someday with anyone that's interested in that. I want to quickly respond to that

dash out because like eight years ago, we actually tried to create a project on food

security. You try to guess where and try to guess what we try to prevent. So I would love

to get in there. We want to build a living city to improve food security for the province

of Hebei and the top diplomats of the province. So that's a province where Wuhan is located.

The top diplomats really wanted us to work on that, but we got kind of cancelled out

by the our own, well, diplomatic frame from Europe. So I'd love to tell you a lot more

about that. And I would love to go into those directions. Thanks. Yes, you want to say something?

Falling like flies going over to Carl. Thankfully, it's turning 11 in the in the morning here.

So I'm relatively awake. And this has been a wonderful conversation. I intended to come

in for about five minutes because I was a little bit bored and ended up staying for

an hour and a half. I think something like that. It's been absolutely wonderful. Mike

and and and mixle. You've been fantastic. And then, you know, Dasha and Jesse and Chris

have been absolutely wonderful as well. You definitely helped this a understand a little

more of the world outside of his cave. Yeah. And my takeaway from this is maybe consciousness

is defined at the point where you can ask if I'm conscious. I'm still conscious. Thank

you, Mike and everyone for indulging my amateur dabbling. I really, really fascinating. And

a lot of things that were said this evening are kind of fuel resonating, which is all

I can ask. And I am actually going to leave you with an eight line poem about brainwaves.

It's called it's called Team Brainwave Action Calibration Chant. And you have to imagine

it in a call and response, but I'm just going to read it in my sleepy monotone here. So it

goes like this. Delta theta alpha beta sequence switcher looper theta gamma gamma gamma hey

flash of insight for today. Beta delta beta alpha blossom honey from alpha alpha gamma

gamma gamma gosh stage dive into mental mush alpha beta delta need a nap. I'll see you

gamma gamma gamma hey remember what you came to say beta alpha theta delta give me sleep

or give me shelter gamma gamma gamma gosh surf the curl of wishy-wash cruise you just made

my day thanks. That was amazing. Glad you liked it. Thank you. That was cool. Anyone else? Is

that it? That's it I guess. Thanks a lot guys. Thank you. Thank you. It was great. Good night.
