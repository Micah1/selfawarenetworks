   2: ⟪ 440 characters skipped ⟫ other notes were given numbers belonging to those notes that were deleted. Going forward I will be reorganizing my notes with a new numbering system as they are transformed into the material for the book.
   4: The series of notes that start with b and end with y, like b0001y are all audio notes, some of them are myself talking to the voice recorder, some of them are conversations with other people that I captured to save what I said so I could include parts of what I said in the book later on.
   6: Some of the original audio included ideas and phrases that might be offensive to someone somewhere, and the transcriptions were done automatically by a deep neural network created by Google using their Recorder.Google.com product found on the Pixel 5 phone. In some cases the transcriptions are incoherent. Over the next six months from June 17th to November 17th when I plan to publish the book. Between now and then I will create the book from these notes in the public eye.
  16: "The Ego Tunnel" is a book by Thomas Metzinger explores the idea that there is no self but asks what is the entity that is experiencing reality?
  18: What is the entity that is you, is essentially analogous to a computational rendering in a cycling phase oscillation or a branching fractal feedback loop entified via brainwave synchronization of temporal & spatially distributed phase changes across the 3D grid neural-glial network. You are entified via the principles of oscillation, as described in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz. As if each of your neurons is a firefly, or a clock, that is synchronizing with other neurons to act as a single sensor, a single transmitter, a sensor that considers information, via thresholds, and predicts the future, via the principles of memory-prediction (spoken of so well by the folks at Numenta, the book On Intelligence) with reality modeled from synapses to the whole brain with reference frames to help the brain coordinate new incoming sensory inputs (to make sense of the world the brain has a reference frame, a concept I read about in the book A thousand brains) but I am saying the whole brain is doing this at the macro level, not just at the meso level of the cortical columns & the hippocampus, and not just at the level of neurons but also at the level of receptors on basically all cells in the body.

  21: I skimmed the article a little bit. Confidentially what I am writing about in my book is how the brains molecular structure creates conscious maps of reality with frequencies, the frequencies interact with each other, but the same molecular structure that produced these frequencies is required to experience these frequencies. I am going to show from atoms to organs, from electrons to neural circuits, how consciousness works. but NDE Near Death Experiences I think have to be compared to DMT experiences, I think, in terms of thalamic bridge modulations, or in other words both NDE and DMT are taking place inside the human brain the entire time, even if we are experiencing leaving our body or traveling to other realms of existence

"Cognition is a faculty for the processing of information, applying knowledge, and changing preferences." the storm changes wind speed, direction, and so many other things those changes could be thought of as prefences, its whole structure is a highly coordinated, and highly responsive thing.

  60: This book is about starting a conversation not ending them, I wanted these to be in print however before I began to distribute them. In part because I want to make it easier for other people to reference all the ideas for discussion, and learn about adjacent ideas, to save myself time from creating a new map for each person one at a time.
  62: The book is a map between ideas across books, papers, videos, but also its a book about ideas across industries from the fields of neuroscience, neurology, neurophysics, computational biology, deep learning.

  42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"

He arrived at a new equation for time before I did. He did not share his equation with me. He offered to write a forward for the book and I asked him to write a blind forward for my book, so we are not going to share notes ahead of time. He will be blind to what I am writing and I will be blind to what he is writing until we are both done writing & its time to publish.

    5: Micah Blumberg Some people say that they are training their holistic AI by having it read a book, yet these same people say that when someone else has AI do supervised training that is not holism. so some people who claim to have holistic AI are not doing holism by their own definition.
   34: Micah Blumberg If you train it on a book, instead of on sets of cats and dogs, then you have created a wider reduction, it's any knowledge, it's still the knowledge it gets trained on, that's not holism, that's a wider lense, a wider reduction. The word holism shouldn't be used at all in relation to this.
   59: What you have in this so-called "holistic" system, or what I called "wider reduction" is a supervised learning, on a book, or on sets of pictures, or sets of data, on one end, and you can call it West pole, because it's different enough to warrant a distinction, but then there is the query, or the goal, set by programmer, is it a cat or a dog? What do you know about cats that makes them distinct from dogs? The query itself forces a reduction. Who is making the selection? Who is choosing the response that feels the most rewarding? Well at this stage it's not the "holistic" system. Holism doesn't apply to this version of the "holistic" system because it isn't modeling rewards and selecting which criteria best fit its given goals.
   64: By doing so I do not need dictionary because it forms its own dictionary from the book and I also do not need english language rule set because that is also evident after the program has finished reading the book.

The word holism shouldn't be used at all in relation to this."

  253: And language is partially reduced - the author took some context - their own rich reality, or what they know from reading books or other media, or some fictional context that they created in their own minds - and wrote words on a page which is a further reduction of their starting context.
  255: We, as intelligent beings, can take any level of rich context - even fitional ones in books - and reduce them further if we like, or expand them back into some richness that feeds on our own experience.

  14: I wasn't the first person to suggest that EEG spectrum tonic brainwaves were related to consciousness. This is an old idea. I am making the distinction. after reading Peter Tse's book The Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation, that the phasic firing pattern of neurons is something that the entire oscillating cortical column sack of neurons is going to observe, notice, learn, and be able to reproduce with different sets of neurons in the fire. I'm arguing that the oscillating sack or cortical column is learning patterns that are neuron invariant, because of the electric, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties of dipoles and oscillators the unique phasic firing patterns are going to disturb every single neuron in the oscillator, and all the neurons in that oscillator will work to slow down those neurons that fire back to a tonic firing rate, to be ready for future firing rates.

  27: I argued somewhere, after reading the book Sync by Steven Strogatz, that fireflies are acting like a single sensor/transmitter, oscillating together because they receive each other signals, and those signals dissipate across the firefly collective, until they are blinking in harmony, but if one of them vanishes, that disturbs the oscillation of the entire collective, so fireflies are a unified entified intelligence, if a frog gets one of them, the rest detect it and move away, because that signal has been inhibited, and that tiny change changes the expected pattern that the entire group of fireflies has.

  142: Research for the book:
  143: Anyone can see that on social media I have shared a lot of brain related books, papers, and images, part of it is stuff I want to see later, most of it is stuff that will not be referenced in the book I am writing at all, these past months I have been keeping many of my most important references that I am writing about in the book close to my heart.
  145: So a look at my social media shares will NOT give you any real clues to the contents of the book, which is about stuff that I have not been sharing.
  147: To explain in more detail what I have also been doing is going through a ton of brain research related books, research papers, videos and other media to check and expand upon each area of my hypothesis, and to find the best references for my arguments either for or against.
  149: This is another situation where there is no way for me to get through all the research available before the book comes out. So I am trying hard to canvas a lot of the recent ideas and read a lot of the best books and the best articles and stuff that is especially relevant to what I am writing about but as with my notes I will effectively have to grab what I can for now and include more research in future editions of the book.
  151: Even if the multitude of ideas that I put forth about how human consciousness might work turn out to be incorrect, the arguments that I will make will include citations (peer reviewed research), references to brain research related books & articles, as well as diagrams and art. 
  153: So if it turns out that I am not correct about some of the key components of how the human brain works the book should still have a lot of value to offer the interested reader in terms of the information it brings together, all the references, the links & analogies I make between different topics in different industries, and the mapping of major research efforts, major companies, major articles, major books, major new emerging technologies, and so on with my notes on all of that.
  155: Early in 2021 I wrote the massive article called "WebAR Wearable Digital Fashion NFT, Bio-Sensors, 3D DNN Shape Completion, Animations, Gan Synthesis" and another article called "Digital Fashion, Art, NFT, AR, VR, WebXR, 3D Deep Learning, BCI, and the future native digital economy." I realized that I now had the experiential qualities needed to organize a massive 300 page book. You can find these articles and more at VRMA.io
  157: Like those two articles my book will cross industries, from neuroscience, to virtual reality, to brain computer interfaces, and machine learning. If you look at all the articles on that page you will see that I have written about medical imaging, deep learning, and yes some of that content will be referenced in the book.

The book will add value to my articles because if someone likes an article that I write they will be able to look at who I am and that will tell them that I'm the author of this book, which they can read if they want, to know more about the topics that I pay close attention to.

   5: This book attempts to present valid new ideas on existing topics: I did check my temperature metaphorically while writing this book because of the stream of novel ideas that occurred to me while researching this book that actually changed the direction of my narrative to a great extent compared to my original vision for the book.  I know that I am 'not suffering' from a case of mania because I have a real daily dose of humility, doubt, and a lot consideration for how to make it clear in the book what I know, what I don't know, what I'm guessing, and what can be supported with references.
   7: Any of the ideas in the book could be incorrect. I may have misinterpreted some of the things that I studied, and some of the ideas might seem valid but may turn out to not work mathmatically, or because of some existing scientific fact that I overlooked. 
   9: Given the extremely novel nature of the ideas that I am presenting I felt that it would be unsafe to discuss the drafts of the book with qualified experts ahead of time. Otherwise I would have consulted mathematicians, neuroscientists, physicists, and others before going to print. I also thought that as a story that the books narrative would be interesting and novel enough to entertain and delight people even if some or all of the ideas turned out to be incorrect.

Effectively the concept of the brain as a hierarchical memory-prediction machine discussed in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkins" or the literature on 'Predictive Coding' explains very well how an understanding of the past, of history, helps the mind to render predictions of the future, even far off predictions.

  4: The most important thing that I took away from the book sync is that it doesn't matter to consciousness whether our brains are dead or alive, because is its the physics of oscillators in a certain information configuration that forms memory patterns as decoherence patterns and produces sensor arrays to be conscious awareness. This consciousness configuration of the brains oscillators comes with a high fidelity sparse distributed time, space, tonic, phasic, and inhibitory memory system, that produces a distributed 3D phase field for learning coincidence patterns, and communicating & computing these patterns.

They are plugs for your mind to stop you from looking deeper. In this book I am going to try out a possible and novel explanation for how the neurophysics of consciousness creates itself producing you from what could otherwise be considered a bag of meat, salt, and water.

I think perhaps you have the likelyhood or probability of a particular memory formation sort of stored in connections between cells, and in dendrites, but the memory does not exist until its created in the actual moment it is experienced. I think this means you can upload a probability distribution that increases the chances a mechanical copy of you will formulate a similar memory reaction, but critically there isn't an actual you to upload. Just a chance of you. Stormy with a chance of rain, and a chance of you.
    9: Lets discuss: Ray Kurzweil says this in this book, so how does he think a person's mind can be uploaded if there actually isn't content in the brain.

   26: Micah, the answer is easy. Brains don't have enough memory to store the massive amount of information coming from the senses in real time. [Read Jeff Hawkins' book On Intelligence.] Due to their limitations, brains cannot store and understand all the aspects of Reality. (Try to record an HD video for several hours and you will need several Gb in multiple SD cards. Whereas Kurzweil calculated the whole memory of the brain is just few Gb.) Thus, brains only store vague abstractions (patterns) that later are triggered through content-addressable memories. Reality is the biggest storage of information brains rely on.
   36: In the same book Micah is reading:
   73: Thanks for looking it up, I appreciate it.  You did, however, claim he was talking about the brain, not an AI. looking up the text you posted in a pdf copy of the book, he says he thinks the brain does 200 computations per second, but massively parallelised. The brain works by time-locked loops. 200 Hz simply is incorrect when the superior olive of the owl can measure phase differences in sound waves of 1 microsecond, which corresponds to a figure of 1 MHz.
  121: From the previous debates I had with Black Square and from the books of Fuster I've read, I conclude spikes are a form of winner-take-almost-all competition in which sensory information is routed through all the huge networks of heterarchical cognits and mutually inhibited to determine the winners. Consciousness emerges when spiking activites surpass certain threshold. It's brain's way of decentralizing pattern recognition. And it also explains human qualia and why machines don't have qualia.

  73: Choices may also be made at the cellular level, an idea expounded upon in Peter Tse’s book the Neural Basis of Freewill: Criterial Causation (linked earlier in the article). I think it’s possible that every cell is making a choice in a sense, it’s firing threshold may represent the information it must collect in order to make a decison, and it may be involved in setting the choice settings (or firing thresholds) for other cells above and below its place in the hierarchy of the cortex.

  346: A Conversation with Mark Zuckerberg and Yuval Noah Harari - About Facebook
  350: Mark Zuckerberg explained in his talk with Sapiens author Yuval Noah Harari. How when free nations demand companies store data locally (in their own countries) it legitimizes authoritarian nations to do the same, this in effect allows all nations, to secretly compel Facebook to hand over that data for their own nefarious purposes. (As long as Facebook’s data centers are located in that country.)
  352: Since some of Facebook’s servers are located inside the United States we can logically deduce from facts, including many news reports, that the US Government is using Facebook messenger to spy on other countries and also all Americans who have conversations with people who live in other countries which is almost all Americans. The US Government can then map and study the relationships of all these Facebook friendships, and they have the option to study your private conversations with the aid of computer automation and analysis tools.

  60: If you read the book "A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins" you realize that motor control isn't happening in one region of the brain it's happening in every cortical column across the entire brain. That's just one way that this map is actually incorrect.
  62: The same thing with executive function, choices, these are not regional activities as many neuroscientists still believe. Choices are happening everywhere at the cell level (Criterial Causation via Peter Tse), and complex choices are happening at the neural circuit scale in the inhibitory interneurons (the concept of criteria causation again but applied to Buzsaki 2006 (Book) figure 11.5 the graphic on inhibitory interneurons neurons)

  6: Okay so like for example the inhibitory neuron system can receive a small input and dramatically change the causality of the firing patterns that result not only in a change to a single downstream neuron but in the entire brain (See disinhibition in the book Rhythms of the Brain (2006)). In essence "non-linear dynamics" accomplished by interneurons is the vehicle for tiny patterns to affect giant patterns.

  12: The purpose of my book, as a sort of conference like presentation of the work others have done is to create exhibits around the sources that are supporting this narrative of phenomenal consciousness being created by a brain to be viewed by a brain in a feedback cycle, a neo mind cycle or a self aware network.
  14: I hope this book is as fun to read as it was fun for me to write.
  16: One thing that I found to be interesting while writing this book was that I suddenly began to see an explosion in article about consciousness in the news. See this article from Keith Frankish, a philosopher and writer for AEON called "What if your consciousness is an Illusion created by your brain" https://aeon.co/essays/what-if-your-consciousness-is-an-illusion-created-by-your-brain

  11: Some or all of ideas in this book might not be correct. I will need to consult with other researchers in various fields before improving these ideas for a 2nd edition. However many of these ideas will be novel to the average reader, some people may have heard similar ideas before, but I think at the very least these ideas make for a good story and that is why they were included. I hope you leave this book with some new ideas of your own about the human mind, specially about neural functions that lead to human consciousness, new artificial intelligence ideas, new brain computer interfaces, new ideas about quantum physics, gravity, what life is (a new definition), what a bit of information is to your conscious brain, how the self emerges from the brains networking functions and so on. While the idea that one person could have so many new ideas on so many diverse topics might seem unlikely its just that there are common physical mechanisms connecting all these different things, and really at the core of it its one new idea that has led to all the others.
  15: The answer to that question crosses many disciplines, and in a sense it pulls together Ila Prigogine, Einstein, Buszaki and others into a conversation that travels from astrophysics, to neurophysics, to brain computer interfaces, virtual reality, and deep learning. Also this book comes with new ideas about how human decision making works from neurophysics to the human experience of consciousness and self-awareness.

Alas my book is more of conference with many exhibits, and a narrative that ties it all together. My research for this book is tracing the path through past research done by others. My contribution I hope will be a compelling narrative that ties it all together. However that only describes Cycle 1 of the book. Cycle 2 is about a new artifical neural network, and Cycle 3 describes next-gen nervegear -Micah Blumberg.

  25: There are papers that suggest the hippocampus is like a cortical column, and or a comparator to cortical column data, maybe its cortical column #1, and maybe that is where the base rendering of consciousness begins, or likes to sit, like the central locus of focus, but the information in just the hippocampal-enthorhinal loop might be like you, the room, the walls, and where you are in the world, and following the book A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins it might be true that each of your other cortical columns gets busy representing other objects, sounds, concepts, and things that are part of your experience in the room, so the cup on the table, and the hot sauce, are each managed by different cortical columns, all the properties of the cup might be sent to a cortical column that is managing the sensory integration for that object, its orientation, position, temperature, texture, sound etc... and when your awareness of that cup increase that is plausibly going to be an increase in the syncronization between that cortical column and the hippocampal entorhinal loop & the parietal temperal junction all at once, this is something we could look for with current medical imaging technology, whether there is brainwave frequency synchronization between hippocampal frequencies and the parietal temporal junction and or specific cortical columns.

  4: "What I like about Peter Tse's book at the end is he frames the question in terms of whether thoughts are passive or whether they have an active role in decision making. It's like are your thoughts just a result that the observer is observing? Or is the observer and the thoughts taking place active in the feedback cycle of decision making, playing a role in the activity instead of being a passive observer of the activity. The idea that the observer is a passive observer I think stems from the idea that the mind is seperate from the body, maybe, the idea that the observer, the mind, and thought are some how seperate from physics or causality or above physics and above causation. I think Peter Tse is not trying to prove that we have choice because of random noise, he is trying to say that information has casual power in the brain, because neurons literally read and write information patterns which allows information to drive neural activity and the brain.

  6: 30 years of neuroscience beats 5000 years of philosophy, I've read Wilber and many more. I've also read many neuroscience books. There is no observable mechanism of choice in the mind, it's a self similar structure through out, it does one thing in summary and that is make predictions, these predictions are part of one long chain of cause and effect. We automatically gather the best information we can, and we are automatically doing the best we can with the information we have. Choice really is an illusion, it's an illusion that might trick someone into choosing worse choices instead of better choices. Without choice we really do have to believe we are doing the best we can with the information we have, because technically its true there is no other choice.

  5: Some say reality is not pre-determined, because of non linear dynamics, chaos theory, from Illa Prigogine to Ronald E. Meyers http://www.army.mil/article/90447/ "Meyers is listed as the inventor on 14 patents. He co-authored a book, "From Instability to Intelligence: Complexity and Predictability in Nonlinear Dynamics," -- covering nonlinear equations in math, physics and biology, and authored a plethora of scientific papers." Prigogine likens choice to a dice-roll, a bet, you have a bellcurve of things you are likely to do in the fat middle, and things you are less likely to do on the thin ends. If nonlinear dynamics applies to brains, then predeterminism isn't possible. No one can perfectly predict the result of how your brain will coordinate you until it happens. Your brain can also change itself, as demonstrated by the emerging science of brain plasticity,

  32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.

   46: In reading your reply I realize you are arguing against a straw man, you are assuming that I am taking a position I am not taking. Perhaps you are familiar with the book called "the brain that changes itself" author Norman Doidge? I believe we must change, we are always changing, and each person is planning developing and growing their next actions, next thoughts and next reactions from the present and past actions, thoughts, and results of their own movements, the movements of others, and the causes of motion in the world. I believe there is no better guide to one's best next action than one's own self. Provided one is no longer a child.
  127: That isn't what I said, and it's more complicated than what I said. Please consider reading a book called: The Neural Basis of Free Will: Criterial Causation. Also having the evidence that proves how neurons make decisions does not automatically give us the ability to predict crimes before they are committed. You seem to rule out the element of chance. There are odds involved that prevent us from predicting the weather two weeks out, and there are odds involved that prevent us from predicting what people will choose. The scale of the odds is perhaps too great to overcome with any current technology/tool.

  35: have you ever taken a class in computational neuroscience? or read a book on artificial neural networks? I ask because what we see is how the eye puts together an image from the retina, to the ganglion cells, eventually to the thalamus, and the visual cortex starting in v1 of the occipital lobes. What we think we see is that an image is made up of temporal frequencies representing lines and edges on some level, and coherent combinations of lines and edges at a higher level, so that from lines and edges a corner could be made, or movement detected, or color, or a letter, and from even higher up a word, or a rose, or some other visual pattern might emerge. It's because of the mechanical operations of all these pieces that an image is manufactured. because we can deduce this from current research it just seems a lot more likely that people are having highly detailed excellent dreams when they claim an Out of body experience. At least in my mind that seems more likely. 

a0476z.md:
  15: My counter argument point is a different point, I am not arguing against that kind of point but instead arguing that if the structure of our minds is like HTM Hierachical Temporal Memory outlined in Jeff Hawkins On Intelligence book then we are fundamentally dividing all sensory representations of the world into hierarchically sorted categories which makes intelligent systems like humans uniquely and inherently good at making distinctions, such that overall humanity is not going to be confused by or mentally disturbed by VR avatars or by video game violence for the same exact reasons. Intelligence is good at making distinctions, inherently, so I'm not afraid that Facebook Spaces will cause dysmorphia

   30: Okay well have you read about neuroplasticity, studied neurophysics, taken classes in neuropsychology??? Have you tried EEG or experienced other such brainscans. Have you read the book "The brain that changes itself" In my research I have. Have you ever read any story that triggered "a chain reaction, the chemical precursors that trigger the onset of an emotion" if you have never felt emotion from something someone said then perhaps you can actually believe that words do not impact you. Wait hold on a second, you say meaning in words can impact your neurophysiology but not words themselves? You say words in a language you don't understand will not impact you aha. Well that would mean you think noise does not impact you right? Have you ever listened to binarual beats, or isochronic beats? Used a mind machine, an Audio Visual System for brainwave entrainment? Does music effect you even if the words are in a foreign language? Because what I mean is that words have an actual impact in your biologicial tissue regardless of whether you know you have been impacted. Just like a loud jarring sound or a soft harmonic voice will have different impacts on your neurology. Wo
   62: Did I miss the memo on some new imperial imperative by the thought police knights of the old republic of chin-a-merican and the federation of monkeys of the junglebook who all agree so it must be so, and the universal church of established science by fiat rather than experimentation, that we are all supposed to be thinking a certain way now? Are the thought police coming to iron all our thoughts into rational reductionist logic, and linear syntax, shall I always think with perfect punctuation grammar and spelling in my head? Is that strict thinking?

  192: So the new idea is to apply topoi, or category theory to Artificial Intelligence, meaning to thinking, to thought, thus began the facebook group called Categories & Geometry of the mind. Somehow your mind has partitioned reality and thinking into two different disconnected non-intersecting spaces, without any explanation, and I almost feel like your drawing a conclusion that is equivalent to me asking what created G-d? and you answering back that G-d created G-d. What is frustrating is that you can express a conjecture with zero reasoning behind it. Like it is some axiom that thought and reality are on two different planes, you don't have to explain why, you don't have to prove it, you don't have to argue it with reason, you just declare it by fiat, and its frustrating https://www.facebook.com/groups/categories.and.geometry.of.mind/

  27: My experience of sensing my awareness as an electric song and or sensing my conscious mind as a stream of consciousness is not an isolated experience. There is a book on EEG that is called "Symphony of the Mind" your brainwaves are coordinated neuron patterns like as if each neuron was the instrument and member of a grand orchestra musical. I didn't conceptualize it at the time, but it was one of those odd things. Have you ever stood on the Seal Beach pier in California from 5am two hours before dawn, to see the most amazing pastel colored sky, light blues and pinks, and then suddenly this gold sunlight that was so vibrant it was like fire in the sky. Like nothing else on earth looks exactly like the Sun, it's unique. The same thing was true when I experienced what I describe as "awareness" or a conscious stream of electrical activity, that was both mundane and magical like the Sun at the same time. To experience it is to experience something unique, something that could not be anything else. Maybe "awareness" isn't the perfect word for it, but whatever it was, it was singing my thoughts.

This neocortex has 86 billion neurons, but essentially there is one simple self similar repeating pattern that processes all of intelligence, all your senses, perceptions, thoughts, feelings, smells, sounds, visual thoughts, things you see, things you know about yourself, all your facts, opinions, all of this is processed with one simple mathematical process. HTM, Heirarchal Temporay Memory, aka PREDICTION, and PREDICTION is so good as a brain theory there are now machines that see video the same way a human see's video. With software and machines modeled on neurons humans have made artificial intelligence that can see, hear, smell, and perceive patterns even with artificia

  27: But there has to be a neurological process for someone to be able to make a distinction between one object and another and that is partially illustrated in cases where someone who is blind, for a long time, is able to see again after some medical procedure restores their sight.

    5: A real goal of this book is to highlight for you the excellent work that others have done to discover what human consciousness is.
    7: I'm 41 years old and my journal into neuroscience began at the age of 16 when I took LSD "Lysergic acid diethylamide" during a class in highschool. At that point onward the "Doors of Perception" the name of a book by Aldous Huxley had been opened for me, and I had become a student of the mind, I became dedicated to understanding its every mystery. I think that human beings are still far from understanding every mystery of the human mind, but I think we have enough knowledge now to understand at both a high level and at a low level what consciousness is, how we can create artifical sentient human level machines, and how we can hack the human mind with nerve gear to both download what we are seeing and hearing but also we can begin to stimulate the human mind to create Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality experiences without glasses. The long term consequence of this could mean a merger between the medical system and the justice system, and a global government system that provides superior education to all of earth's citizens to help protect lifeforms and our collective habitat.
   11: My -notaPHD Thesus" that I am setting out to write as a : Humanity has already figured out how consciousness works. The point of this book is to provide a hot take on science that has been available to all of us for years. The goal is to attempt some novel functional metaphors about what human thinking really is, how we might interface with it as computational system, and how we might create robots that are sentient someday.
   29: This is a book about how the human mind might work, how we might approach hacking the human mind, how we might make conscious sentient self aware machines with phenominal conscious experience,/ and how we might connect that machine to the human brain.

Why what, what's been with the risk of just leaving you alone?

Every oscillation entity knocks on everything other oscillating entity if it has the physical means to do so.
  102: # *search the notes in this repo for 'magnify & inhibition' specifically in note a0129z.md , a single neuron that fires magnifies its stored memory pattern by inhibiting many nearby neurons, I realized this concept by connecting the discussion of neurons inhibiting nearby neurons in Numenta's work, "A Thousand Brains & On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkings, and papers from Numenta" with the discussion of a photocopier being a magnifier in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz"

  157: Over all these years has just led him astray. So his brain is literally, you know, stuck playing the evil record, people record player, the evil playbook that he can't stop playing because that is what he's been wired to do. In order to get rewards his his social contract with humanity, is that he will do evil in return for rewards and that plays out in a movie like way in his brain.
  254: And so, we need to sort of, like, have like a scientific and imagination. And we have, there's an unfortunately, there's a huge amount of past scientific books of things that are possible. When anything any kind of machine that is possible, is possible to build. And that is the reality because our reality that we're entering into is that we need to defend agains these kinds of science fiction threats because they're no longer science fiction threats.
  383: It just means these are some ideas that are talked about in the kiln book by David Brandon, right? And some of the ideas are like, yeah, well we can link

  432: He wrote this book called thresholds in the mind, and I took his online course, whatever it was called.

Your brain is predicting for change of the world has changed as included, Facebook.
   55: And so I thought. Yes. So we should have like, definitely have what is interesting about a Facebook right? Okay, let's say that.
  109: They they do it. They're able to combine so when you're on a sensory capability but because of the mathematical mathematical principles of oscillation, you should read about and book sink by my mathematician.

And I say this because I was reading in John Lee's book that the that the white blood cell can can can sprout arms and and pull and push and fraud and move force its way through these the cellular structure.
   97: This was from the book by Versace and who is saying, but this is great, this was great, this is a great moment, right? And, and it was a great thing to present to use here is wow, his book is so good.
  100: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so here's the thing. So, the way to structure the book is I have a lot of my own original material right? But what I'm going to is sort of like writing ideas, while I think I have someone else's material, right? So if I use someone this episode, if I think of the book is like a series of articles.
  109: I what I want to do is sort of like explore. I want to list of all the exhibits and then I want to sort of like, explore the exhibits one at a time and just add that to the book. And so the book is just like, about these exhibits, right?

   6: Of the mind book. He line his name created, several different math equations. For how much electricity at each level current, or at each voltage, how much electricity would be required? You know, like like if you electricity is streaming through it, a certain rate, right? If it's a certain, I have, the current is like five or something, right?
   9: If and then it's gonna then it's gonna take. Then if the cells like a but like has a threshold firing, right? Then it's going to take a certain amount of current for to be to pass from the electric battery, to the cell. And anyway, get those equations, get those numbers because then you can sort of like have that in the book.

  120: And you can see videos of my of my, I'd make AR and beer applications and also I incorporate I make brain computer interface software. So there's one of my applications brings EEG into VR. And so I've got applied experience with brain break of your interface tag and I so I'm actually writing a book right now in which I'm gonna talk about brain, computer interfaces, and that had been some design ideas I have for newborn computer interfaces and also, for artificial brains for how to build them.
  126: Like think I have something new to say that people have never heard before and I'm also going to write about quantum gravity, I believe that I am going to propose a new equation to explain quantum gravity. I'm going to do all four of these things in my book. So brain computer interfaces, artificial intelligence and in between is is going to be artificial cortex and and then quantum physics in connecting to gravity and also how human brains work.
  129: So, I'm actually writing that book right now and very excited about it. And by you can definitely check out my previous work and you've got the links now. So,
  192: I just want to find this note because I actually put a lot of work into this, for my book, we're just coming out soon. I am hoping that. Okay, it'll come out this December. I'm working on it. Yeah, I've got a lot of work to do.
  261: Yeah, I'm so the book, I'm writing a book that I think is gonna change the world for real. Like a really is gonna like it's gonna like it's gonna I'm gonna hit, I'm hitting like five different, angel topics simultaneously, but innovations at all, five of them. And I I feel like I've been you know it lightning five times that.
  264: That's how like, profoundness. And, but besides the book, then there's gonna be a wet. There's gonna be a web VR web expert website, which talks about the contents of the book in 3D and VR. And then there's, and then there's gonna be a brain. I'm gonna make brain computer interface, there's new ones.
  303: I well you got to read my book because I'm gonna tell I'm gonna like I think I know what the mechanism is. It's gonna be in my book. Yeah.
  363: That's that is that provides a window into your brain activity and in. That's so anyway, I'm also a narrow imager. So that's I think a lot about that. It's part of my book.

   4: So the reason I ask people to read the book sells by John Leaf is is that the the book specifically outlines the fact that that it is specifically described the extraordinary things that sells to that scientists have sounded actually clarified it describes just some of the things that cells do that and and scientists don't really understand how cells can do these things in terms of how they can communicate.
  73: And so I have some new ideas but I also have some ideas about how to integrate some old ideas together. And so that's that's a that's part of the the book. So so I need to talk about like the grant the the capabilities of neurons, the ways they can talk to each other, the kinds of things they can do.
  76: Part of that is from drawn leaves book but part of that is from from sort of like considering what a an artificial known network can do but then expanding on that if you had the additional structure and features of the of the, what's going on and in a neural network, it's in any human neural network.
  91: They have to decide into detectors. Basically, and that's, that's, that's a big part of what this book is about. What? Those detectors are how they work, how they communicate and how they produce a conscious reality and then how that that is. And then we have to look at the observer effect, okay?

   2: Book Draft Artwork
  20: So I'm glad. So this is the draft version of my book and basically I'm showing you like all the different parts that I have planned to, to create this book. And that includes like basically transcribing audio calls and like like and this. And then, as soon as I finish like so you can support this project by pre-ordering my book, which means that after I'm finished with the book, you get, you get the draft for free.
  23: That's what this is. And then after I'm finished with my book, you get the official version of the book, which is like all the improvements that I made to the draft, like, all of the, all the reordering of topic, you get both, you get the draft. And you get the finished version which is like the updated version of the book and a lot of, you know, there will be some parts that maybe didn't make sense to you in the draft.
  26: That certainly become if I'd and I may have some new things to say in the final version of the book. And so I hope that's gonna be exciting for people. So you can read the draft. You can see why I'm excited about this work, at this, this part is for free, I want you to, if you like this, I want you to consider purchasing my book and purchasing two copies of my book.
  29: If you really want to support my project even more and if you really like the book, I'm definitely looking for artwork virtual artwork 3D artwork, people want to collaborate. I am going to be showing people how to make VR pages with a frame and I love you to collaborate with me to create a virtual art exhibit, that is about the concepts in this book.
  38: But still like you like you maintain your avatar and your personal belongings and stuff and in the meta verse and we're gonna, but we're gonna do it with web store and that's through, I'm gonna explain that in an upcoming article. So so that's part of the this is the draft of the book and I hope you get a sense of where I'm going with the completed book and there's a lot more to lot to do.
  41: And I just wanted to motivate everybody. And and and to, I mean, you know, and I would definitely love people to criticize this book in any way. They wish, right? Anything that I got wrong, I want to hear it and like, tell me about it and like that, I'll use that to improve the book for for publication, like right?
  47: That you have something. If you something to add, that would be great to include. I'll give you a, thank you for helping me. So this is like a community book project, where I'm asking, everybody who wants to be a reviewer and a helper in a contributor, to go ahead and and, and be ever of your helper and contributor.
  50: And the whole world is invited to do it. So, that's so everybody can can help with the, with contributing to, to the final version. And then also the final version is what else to support the book. But you get to keep the draft for free and you get to, you get to be part of it.

I guess there's different ways of fireflies can can SYNC and different species that can sink where they all fire in a sequence right after it one another. (Isn't it true that all species that flock together or swim together or work together are synchronizing in a valid sense? Yes I think so. Yes I SYNC so!)

I'm really sorry. So what I'm saying was with kind of causing me to become confused, is everyone has been telling me for years and I've been bleeding for for years that the whole factory doesn't, it doesn't travel even like in Busaki's book, 2006 is like in an even like like this is something I've heard.

You know, what's weird is, I, I started writing a book and that I'm working on a that I didn't intend to write about physics in the book, but I, but I, but I'm like, that's where my, that's where this is the direction I'm going in right now.
  174: I mean, the book and
  234: Oh, I guess I'm I guess I'm very multi disciplinary and I don't. I mix a mix different feels of study together and I love. Yeah, I'm actually writing a book that combines many different fields of study together. It's it's I I think that. Yeah, I hope you read it because I think you're really like this book.
  237: Not it's not everyone's cup of tea, but if people are interested in is certain ideas and they're gonna like this book. So,
  240: This thing with an open, Google box, waiting free to save any title. What does that mean? You're sitting in with an open? Google box waiting free to save any title. I'm sorry. You said that there was a book that you thought that we would have enjoyed and waiting for the title so I can put it into Google.
  243: No I'm saying I'm writing a I'm writing a book and oh you're the one you're writing. Oh, absolutely absolutely yeah, yeah. No, I'm sorry. It's it's, it's not it's not done yet but but I but I think that people who are interested in how the mind works are gonna dig the, they're really gonna like my book because I go into a lot of the neurofits, the human mind and also the physics and the math and the and brain computer interfaces.
  246: And also artificial intelligence is another topic and the in the book how we can make new kinds of neural networks that are conscious conscious like like human human beings are. So I I have good ideas that I'm working on, but that a lot of it is, is coming together nicely, and but there are certain areas where I still have work to do.
  249: So it's like, what I've got, is, I mean, I don't know if you guys want to hear about this, right? I, I've got like, I've got an enormous amount of material written, and I've got an enormous amount of organization work that I've done in terms of, like, organizing the structure of the book and the contents of the book and deciding, what's going into the book, and it's not going in the book.
  252: And I've got all these notes, and all these audio recordings that I'm going to turn into basically chapters that, you know, like, I've I like, I've in some cases recorded, a chapter with my microphone or type to chapter into a note. And now I'm like integrating them into like the body of the book and it's all like there's like a tons of.
  255: Like I don't think there's gonna be there's any other book out there. That's like my book in terms of how in terms of like how many different. Because the reason I brought this up is because because is is the idea of like, you know, we accidentally started talking about a different area of research and like, always a second.
  258: That's not my, not where I go, usually. And I was just, I was just making the point that I'm bringing together, like a lot of different industries and into this book. Like, there's there's, it's weird like, you know, I'm talking about, you know, virtue reality and augmented reality in a context of, of the brain.
  264: If you like this discussion you'll like the book yeah. Yeah, I have two thoughts and one of them is are you sure we'll just be one book when you're finished collating? All of the all of its entities. That sounds like it maybe like a couple of. Yeah. No, I'm already.

Also be like different different different ways at this process happens in different species. So I so yeah. I I'm actually forgetting how this works but this is a lot of this comes from the book sink if you.
  193: So, if you want to read more about fireflies and sinking, I read the booksink and that taught me so much about you know what it means when and that neurons are oscillators. And that, then the whole brain is oscillating. It's a chaotic, chaotic oscillation like that. Like the book sync, really helps me understand that the computations of, of oscillations and that informed, the self-orients book.

  35: Where the neuron, it wasn't. It wasn't it. Kind of wasn't until I was reading the book snap by, I mean sink book sync. I that mathematician that I sort of like he mentioned, he's talking about oscillators, right? So also there's this book called rhythms of the brain by and major scientists measure the major influencer sign, a neuroscientist and Giorgio Brusaki.
  37: And he, he's talking about the, the rhythms or the oscillations of the brain. And then this book started, this book sink to have more about oscillations after reading the talk about because he didn't like he started to go and that but he didn't go into super death and how authors work and this book Saint does which is very eliminating.
  57: I mean from what was described in the book I I'm thinking maybe there's there's actually not a lot of study on biological oscillators in terms of like you know what unique properties. They might have that a physical oscillator doesn't have, there's lots of interesting ideas, but but the keep it, but.
  59: So in in the book think he said something like, you know, if the bat spots occupy
  91: Then the idea that there's a photocopier enlargement function associated with an oscillation, which is hand flooding, and the in eye sort of like, you know, in thinking about this book, think about exactly book and think it also about this book sink was that, you know, that the oscillating group of the whole neural oscillator is not going to oscillate at the same time because you have first of all, if you have a bunch of neurons that are going off and sending signals to the extra terminal that's going to cause the set of the of its external to become inhibited.
  93: Instead of it's an external will receive a signal. It is is as if it's being instructed to slow down because that's what this what it's going to do. Because maybe it's potassium channels open faster or something or this or the the sodium channels are inhibited something and then you have this other situation where you know a Facebook first happened and either attack either sodium channels open up a lot faster or potassium channels.

I could see multiple versions of the universe overlapping one another like layers in a 3D virtual reality photoshop that was reality. As if reality was a transparent onion with many layers.

  43: Right? When when you know what John Carmack refers to is like when you're when you're reading a book about rockets but how rockets are made or and and suddenly a concept from how gunpowder works like helps you to imagine a new rocket design, that might be a lot more efficient and like and like yeah.
  45: So John Carmack has it has described experiences like that. Were you reading that? I an idea in a book that's unrelated to the topic that you're reading. But you'll, you're able to pull out like an information configuration, that's sort of like substrating variant and that now, it works, you know, now we can go from, you know, take the lessons of how rocket rockets work and and make better guns or vice versa make use of lessons and have them to work and make better rockets.

   65: Of that one oscillator. Like that's that's when we're going from like you know to the pyramid cell that now collects the internal and that connects to another portable column. All right?

  107: There's a way to compare apples to apples, right? So if you look at like basically the the book, I mean sorry if you get narrow pipe these ideas, how can we relate different sense of unstructured data like heart data and EEG data and you kind of need to, you know, figure out how to create like, create a relatable time series, right?
  153: There are basically the default modem network, the rich clubs because of the global off because of the they ought the the way, the brain is connected globally, you know, at the perimeter cells and the six layer, like then, you know, I think of it as the global So in the book he's saying like basically like the transformation of, you know, sending a spike from one neuron to other neurons.
  183: Right, let's say that. You're you're internal mode out modality. Interpretations of hearing are very like amplified for you. Maybe you're very like you're very into like you're acoustic way or vocal way of processing information. Like audiobooks are much easier for you than textbooks and it's like your mind is very efficient and processing audio information.
  193: So it creates an like the the chance for a negative way. Right. And negative way that decreases the chance, is that like that pushes like the potential pattern of what is activated in another layer. It narrows the narrows down what gets activated because of because if you look at the the in the book saying they said, there's basically there's now there's no like or there could be like terrible spots or terrible points and in the network.

   7: Now, I've already done many past. I've done several past recordings been realized podcasts, but, but I would, I believe it. So there's stuff in the past you can check out you can listen to old recordings. But, but so I believe the idea is that I'm sharing in this book, you know, some of them could be right.
  45: And, you know, Dr. Peter C. He he he's a neuroscientist from. Who's professor at Princeton. And and he wrote this, the criteria causation book that the narrow basis of free will criteria causation and he you know points out that basically if if all the cells are firing at the same rate, there's no information in that pattern.

  171: So what I'm trying to understand is, as I'm going back to the book scene and I'm trying to understand. Did he say that that asked later was like a photocopier or like a met like a magnifier? Because that's what I think. That's what I thought he said and then and it's like the principal to how even like a photocopier works or how image scaling works.
  174: And I'm now I'm like well wait a second I I'm not sure that that's what he said and I'm like, wait a second, how could scaling then? You know, like what? Exactly. Like, it might like if the basis of my idea isn't here in this book, then why does it work?
  186: So so in the book saying, how order emerges from chaos, what he says is if you if you have the aces that basically a different. So a bad point is a point that if you start from a bad point the whole system doesn't reach oscillation. Right. But he's saying that that points have no area because if you have a bad point, what happens is in one cycle that bad point moves to a most from one oscillator to another.

  29: You're gonna need sufficient power for that to move your arms and legs, right? So so the, so the neurons, when they oscillate together they're they are sending a charge together and so the brain can have groups of neurons become oscillators that that in the oscillators, as I'll point on the book can learn patterns and the patterns that they learn.

  15: Okay, you think okay. But then you say politics is like a plant. And, and this is from his book. This is this example. Well, now that doesn't make sense. How does politics like a planet? The dog fight? The dog fight analogy made more a sense because we know that one, right?
  27: So it's very like this is for this book is gonna definitely resonate acoustically with people who are auditoryally inclined. You should get the audiobook version of it. Now, I'm but I. But in terms of like, yeah, so the idea of the orchestra of the mind is not a new idea.
  29: There was a book of about EG that was called symphony of the mind. That's worth reading. When I read his book, most closely reminds me of a book by Nicholas Humphries called sold us which described sort of like the suit. The the symphony, like, activity of the mind is, is being the the symphony of the soul, remember correctly.
  31: I have to go and look that up, but I need to go back and review those books. Make sure I have have them correct that. Yeah, that I will do that now. I mean, they're suggesting that the mothers in, in his book, there's some sign. There's some research conclusions that the mothers interaction with the infant, is sort of like setting up and establishing the turntaking of of social behavior of speaking and listening.
  41: But I definitely will find find out for sure in the second edition and are basically. There will be like if you like I'll update like I'll do this is the first, this is the first print. But if you order the first print, when I, when I update the book, I will make the second second edition available to you for free.
  43: If you bought the first book so you just make. I just have like the receipt of purchase will be and NFT, right? That's your first heated purchase and then I'll send you the first edition and then I'll send you the second edition. So the first edition I expect to have a lot of errors and then I'm going to work out with the neuron and mechanisms are like after feet after dialogue and feedback and I'll and I'll note you know, I'll record a record my collaborations so basically I'll figure it.
  45: Figure them out and record my collaborations with neuroscientists. In fact that's actually the way I want to do it as a recording as part of the release podcast. So the follow-up, the follow up to the book will be to sort of try to improve the the book by asking real neuroscientists.
  47: In recorded broadcast conversations to help me improve various parts of my theory. And so that way, I have basically a series that's about improving how consciousness actually works because far beyond with Tom beakbains book is proposing, but one of the things I want to note is that is that everything that he describes in terms of, you know, the the the brain being able to make analogies in one sensory date domain and compare them to analogies and another sensory domain that concept for sort of was also sort of like exemplified and goalless right when you can make when when when when someone can make make an analogy of a self-referential loop in mathematics and with with an auditory feedback loop or visual feedback loop and then sort of like the scribe, like a learning feedback loop for human being, right?

   5: So with the soccer's book, read the most of the brain and 2006. He talks about the fractal nature of EeG readings and multiple scales. Whether you're measuring whether you're measuring electrical fields that are they represent a few hundred neurons in depth in the cortex or your measuring millions of neurons.
  35: Frequencies in different locations playing out in different ways over time. And so if you imagine that this is like a notebook. You have to imagine this is the worst fucking notebook because today, I mean, no what I'm saying is like, imagine. Like, instead of a piece of paper that you, you are trying to write on water, you're trying to write.
  41: But very quickly, the movement of the water is going to dissipate that line and that's kind of like that. Seems like it would be a terrible notebook for like keeping knowledge for a while and on top of that it's like so yeah. So so maybe you have some the neuroanatomy some of your neurons will represent that line but then there's neuronal drift then then the what happens what represents that what seems to represent that pattern could be a different set of neurons.
  45: It's like it's like now, I'm writing the letter t and I'm trying to write it in the same place. I wrote it last time but it's actually appearing in the notebook somewhere else somewhere that I didn't didn't intend for it to be and so you have this pattern sort of patterned drift and this is really confusing for people.

Ever since I was, you know, in retrospect like I this work in hindsight, after finish, after writing this book, I realized that this work really has been the work of a lifetime.

  152: When you are not when your attention is not needed. And so attention is basically. I think of the analogous multi-scale pattern. Replication pattern linking between microscale and macroscale, representations, or basically the fractal, the factory representations on multiple scales across the acrostic wrath, the multi-level graph networks of the brain. And so in chapter 4 of Michael Graziano's book rethinking consciousness, he says that there's, he says that the central idea of consciousness is of this right of attention.

And I had an idea about what might be going wrong in someone else's brain. And that gave me an insight into my own brand because I took the same sort of, like, I imagined a process of how that other person's brain was not performing correctly.
  13: I'm making an assumption about what's true, right? In terms of the importance of my own ability to put together complex information, right? All those ideas are related and the relating factor is time temporal synchronicity. And if that moment, I knew how it was going to do this book. I knew how I was going to accomplish this book.

And I'm going to depict this in artwork, like an artificial mind, and a human mind and having them too connected by ethylamic bridge. And this would be like in the closing of the book and this is like about how real soon you know networks artificial neurology and nerve care will come together.

  23: You know are putting together huge amounts of information. So there's like but basically. Yeah. Like so then there's books right? So so there's people who like you know they write treats the people who write articles, people who write books and then there's people who like, you know, like I guess to they're creating content every day.

b0194y ctpr.txt:
  33: And earlier I thought. Well what if the what if I give the book out for free like shareware but if you want to if you want to own an authentic copy of this book, then you can buy an NFT which referring which will certify that the copy that you own, which is identical to every other copy is a copy that you actually bought and paid for.
  35: Like, that's what you'll get. Is you get a the receipt proves that you were willing to trade money for this book and then whether you like are embarrassed by that or like really well, just really like proud. What if you're just really proud to be a reader and owner of this book?
  37: That's that's what I'm going for is. Yeah. I'm like, yeah, if you read this book, like, you're I know you're badass because this is buck is about all the cool stuff. So, anyway, I would sell the book by, you know, they making any they buy an entity of the book, which is proof that book at the copy.

b0195y ctpr.txt:
   58: And from those points, it's recon. It's constructing a picture, which is a representation internal representation of reality. And so my argument with this book is that that you are going to have. So there's, it's like, if we could, if we could see the brands of 3d sort of 3d nail network, like, like point net, or like deep learning to the point net plus, plus, is a deep learning on network for 3d classifications segmentation.
   88: That's a good, it's a good open question. There's lots of opportunity for for more research, there could be hundreds of years, more research that would be done on the brain. After after this book, many hundreds of years, it depends on, you know, how how, how fast technology is going to continue accelerating.
  100: They're going to predict that. There's a theory out. There called prediction. Prediction coding or coding. Yeah, predictive coding. That's what it is. And it's also sort of the same as similar ideas, is founded. A similar idea to predictive coding is found in the book on intelligence by day of hocking is where the idea is that you are, your brain is making predictions of the world, and those predictions are how it models the world.
  106: If you take the cap off, how the cap is going to feel, when you're unscrewing it same thing, when you reach out for a door handle, this was the door handle one was was one of the ones in Jeff Hawkins book on intelligence, you reach out for a door handle, you have this prediction, your mind is going to feel and if it felt very different, it'd be a surprise and the fact that would be surprised points to the fact that you are prediction are app that you're making predictions about the world.
  114: Is there a little man inside the head? Where's how does this information become conscious? How does this become something that we think about? That's I think that's what I can add to the picture a little bit and so we know so you know this is a scrapbook called rhythms of the brain by the key I think is how you pronounce anyone.
  116: I'm sure but I guess this book is spoken. But anyway, so he the book is really worth reading. It's probably mandatory for neuroscientists and neurologists to read definitely covers a lot and he's a newer book out. It's also sort of mandatory reading the brain from inside out. And but what I'm getting out of, so we have sensory predictions but we also we should look at you know, how look at the example of a point now, plus plus, and how these your brain is as a 3D null network is going to be able to do at least the same sort of operations that point net plus plus does, which is where it's your brain is going to go is okay.
  292: The fact that, you know, that there's just two fingers and someone else is seeing four because they're drunk. So we have these representations of sequences of the world around us and I'm saying that, you know, we've got Jeff Hawkins book and we've got predictive coding on intelligence. So we've got predictive coding, that point us to, you know, a method for how the brain could be making templates.
  348: That's listening to another group of neurons fire. And what's, what's firing? It has includes patterns that are temporal spatial and phasic and phasic in terms of like you know, these are these are frequencies that go beyond it, the go beyond the physics as opposed to tonic. So Facebook is exotic which is like slow and regular signals and answers a slow and regular time consolation.
  350: That is very regular and it's a whole bunch of neurons doing it. So it's not really information but then you have phasic firing which is unique and if that's like when the piano when you hear a piano note, that's the phasic firing and that Facebook firing is much, it's much higher for frequency.
  391: They that that is creating a sort of pushback, sort of dialectic opponent sort of functional 10 segregating where the the information which is like simultaneously Facebook. But also electromagnetic is being generated to sort of push back against that force being pushed on the rest of humanity. And that's what that is the reason why authoritarian regimens eventually topple because they're creating their own opponents and their opponents keep growing because there be because they're behavior is is you know, creating too many negative ways and those ways come back, it's this sort of like principal of opposing forces in it.

   21: We're really, really thinking about pointing at plus plus, which still outperforms even multimodal networks by opening AI, and by deep mind. So and by Facebook, so we're still like in terms of like point cloud three, semantics segmentation point cloud networks because the data that it's learning is multi-dimensional, it doesn't suffer as much from the issue of noise.
  131: That are, you know, both small and large. But also affecting these signals are affecting the. The, what's it called? What they're affecting. What's what's not going to fire? Or they're affecting? Basically the inhibitory system. So the inhibitory system and I like the book that really explains this really well, is rhythms of the brain 2006, a 2006 book, rhythms of the brain.
  211: They say, if you, if you have, if you have one of the things in the neuroplasticity book was, if you're, if you're, if you write hand, you know, some people sometimes, some people like they had a stroke or something, and they lost their functionality in their right hand or something, or they're right arm.

   5: So, what I want to talk about here is the idea of the book being about puzzle pieces. The argument is that we've all that. So, okay, so and I recap, so I want to talk about my journey to sort of in the first third of the book to sort of give a contact for when I encountered certain ideas and and and how they affected me.
   7: And, and how I came to recently, think of some of the amazing concepts that I found is puzzle pieces. And so the argument of the book essentially is to to change because I I've often heard in arguments about neuroscience that bridge neuroscience and how to build artificial general intelligence or where AI super sentient AI or just conscious AI over self-aware AI that's conscious and sentient and able to learn any type of knowledge.
  11: And so that is the book. The books narrative basically is to pull up all of the puzzle pieces. Across, you know, different discoveries and neuroscientists from different professors different authors, different teachers and different. You know you know researchers and but also to tie it but to tie together some concepts from from technology, not not that.
  13: I believe that you know with technology we have lots of interesting analogies but this book intends also to get precise like me. So, like you've seen many neuroscience, there are many neuroscience talks and about consciousness that that it's sort of dance around that they sort of like say, oh well we're just gonna like throw up our hands with the idea that we're going to be able to tell you today, how what your brain is doing is pretty is producing phenomenal.
  23: It's gonna need at least the most primitive type of brain and so we can look at evolution and everything. See. Well what is what is the you know, there's that there's a spinal cord. The brainstem the brain is this, there's a good book. That's great books, bad evolution. But but really, what?
  59: I want to walk through a journey of my life, sort of like, describe all the puzzle pieces and then I want to begin to connect how these publications fit together. And so in a way, one of the things that I need to do has to actually make a collection of puzzle pieces and I collected a ton of other pieces and I shared them and my Facebook pages and Facebook groups, these are articles and links to books and and videos.

   5: So let's go backwards. I've got to explain the story about David Eagleman. The book Queen, his book incognito because it was what it was really one of them. Most profound books in terms of and it for sure, for sure to two major reasons. One of them was about the that you know, one of the major points is that you don't have as much choices.
   7: You think you do far left, right? And thank you dude. That was one of the arguments and through that book. All right. I I began to understand how human civilization for the person. I, I could grasp how humans position as a whole could exist where choice is not actually real for known actually has choices.
  19: We can repair. So we're talking about emerging the medical and criminal justice system. Because because if for all robots, then then greening then we need to be talking about repairing ourselves and that's what David Eamon's book might sound. Is that these his points? When people and apparently, there's large groups of people who are child molesters, just large numbers of them, and right, renders in the sense that like,

b0206y ctpr.txt:
  57: There are, there needs to be a convergence of the the medical system with the justice system. And I think that's an argument that I have to make it's going back to incognito. That's how the book has to end. I think I'll go back to David England and incognito.

b0209y ctpr.txt:
    9: So people people want to for this book, to really be widely celebrated in, like the foundation of my future work, talk. A lot about great technologies that have been. So as I mentioned, I want to talk about the work of the scientists, you know? All they, let's say like everyone who speaks at the DTC summit.
   45: So that's the self-aware. That's it's part of the stuff. We're story is this sort of like the neurophysics of what's happening in the brain and where is the frontier? So I need to mention all the. There are science books that I recommended to on the basically the books. In my mind, kind of you talk about my favorite books, okay?
   69: We have unrel engine five. We have Facebook. There's a lot happening on that thread and I'm thinking, okay, now, wait a second. Not just, I'm curious. So I think I kind of need to go back and dig into the next find out if he has an universe concept because Nexus just links us together with a group of people, so we can share our minds, so we can really tell there's emotions, right?
  109: ⟪ 273 characters skipped ⟫memory it might be in neural circuits, based on that study, so recorded that and that's why neuralink is going to be nearly like technology will be reading and running thoughts and then so we had Facebook pulling out whole words from the brain.
  134: And so, okay, so I have a big scope. Okay, so the the first third of the book, the book is divided into thirds and the first third is about neuroscience. The second third is about artificial intelligence and the the final third is about
  138: Care. And XR nerve care. And excellent because the concert the conversation. So first there is about nerve science. And because the brain is a huge topic. So we, so and we need to talk about all the books. All the papers we need to talk about the macro, the medical scale, and the micro of the of the brain, okay?
  142: And then we need to go into AI. So I think the bridge to the second book. So like towards the end is when we dive into like, maybe like the micro scale because the micro. So we start off the with the macro and then we go to the meso and then we go to the micro we end in the micro because when we get into the dendrite function and then we can start to get into the perceptron and we can we can we can we can share that alternative design for the perceptron and then we can start to talk about neural networks.
  154: Yeah, so what I'm saying is okay. Look, I here's here's what I do. Here's what I can do. I've got the book in threeth in. I've got, I'm gonna turn the book into three different sections, three different sections and let's talk about the brain. Okay, so we've got the the microscale brain.

  45: So the mind map is like, okay, so start with that summary to, these are all the low level pieces that connect to this bigger picture. And that's what the book is about, is a book is. Okay, so this is the hypothesis and then these are the pieces that add up to the hypothesis.

  37: It's a book that's it's the first word it sells, and I forget the rest of it was something about sales, talking the cells and it's just a really, it's a, it's amazing. All the different ways that I'll talk to each other. Sure.

   71: Anyway, that was the book called me that got me interested in gorgeous because I read it and I realized there that hey we have invented vaccines, we have sent people to move, we humans with all kinds of amazing things but we don't know how the brain generates or is related to consciousness and that was just a boom moment for me.
   73: And after that, there was just so cold up in this program that ever, since I've been kind of working on it. A bit, at least. That's great. And did you mention that? You spend some time with singer and studying gamma isolations? Yes. So I mean I started working and studying wonderfulness myself so I read on both the books that I had that I could find and then I got really interested.

   40: And who do you work with? And how do you get a funded and like the whole process of organizing like all of your content, you know, with gonna like if you're gonna organize a book or if you can organize like what is a major thing that you want to do that?
  138: Yeah. I mean the animated catch-up is like, I mean, I literally read books and papers on neuroscience. And and I think it's like at least 15 years of biology to catch up to like everything that I've read. So just like like definitely. You definitely won't won't learn everything from me.

  31: So it's like the Oculus Rift deck, right? They had to comply Oculus home and it's a full like PC with Linux on it. It's got oculus on it, right? But it's also an AR. It's like, it's got, it's gonna layer tablet, right? And the Facebook one might have augmented reality, right?
  37: Like what? Who else would think of coming out with augmented reality. The had a game had attached. This is something that Facebook with things to do, all right?

b0250y ctpr.txt:
  12: And so the there's a, I think that, you know, there's this book that called don't spit a small thing's that it's very useful to some people who are just there. They're, they're in that sort of like pattern of sweating the small things but you have to like you know realize everything is a small thing if you if you need it to be everything is a small thing if you need it to be.

   11: And it's it's kind of exciting to see this article because I just finished well actually it's not finished. I'm still working my way through the book rhythms of the brain, but there's a lot that that book has sort of like expanded spending the horizon on my focus on the importance of of oscillations, local and global oscillations.
   14: I mean, what is a global oscillation? Right? I mean, it's I'm, I just mean like large scale. Brain oscillations brainwave patterns. And you know so I think where the book is going is it is I think it's making an argument that small scale. Brain activity affects large-scale like brain activity, but the large scale brain activity.
   23: I will. So I went to I, so I started this Facebook group called self-aware networks. And that is a way that you can find the two articles that, I'm, that that were talking about. So, the IR, what's actually not just too articles but it's just about to talking about, the latest science news.
   35: Because okay, so I'm reading this book and it's called, it's, it's called, it's called a John leaves cells. Oh, let me just look at it because that will help my memory here. By the way, I'm gonna go ahead and mute myself for a second and I'm gonna invite more people up and I think Lisa asked a question but I forgot we just had again.
   41: Oh, right on. Okay, so let me just meet myself for a second and what was the name of that book again that you recommended? Yeah.
   50: Yeah, there's a lot to say about that. So I have to read this book. Oh I think I have read this book. Yeah, but it's back like 10 years ago. Wow. This is a whole book. Yeah. No, I think I read this book in 2012. 2008 book. Yeah, this was a yeah this is a this was a yeah, this would be.
   53: Yeah, I forgot about this book but it was. Hm, I wonder if I stop a copy somewhere, but it's very relevant.
  160: It's no, I mean not not not consciously it just it just seems like it's such an ordinary thing for cells to be able to do. I'm current like I'm currently looking at the this I mean really put my Kindle and tell you about this book. See, kindle is located here.
  175: Yeah, that that is another thing but I did find it. So this book that is really excellent that I that I think is worth mentioning in, you know and then in something about news it's a new book so it's news the secret language of cells by John leaf. MD, this book is excellent and this book, you know, right from the beginning, right from the get-go he talks about.
  178: Why can't I'm just like I'm trying to go back to the about this book to the cover. I'm trying to go back to recovery. Yeah. Navigating Kindle is, is sometimes a little bit more complex than you might think. All right, let's go back. The it's actually not that complex.
  181: I'm seven trying to do it while doing clubhouse. Just the weird thing. Yeah. So he basically like right from the get-go, he says, okay. Basically, this book is that is about the fact that that life is about the communication that's happening between cells. And by describing the life he says, in the book, I'm just quoting by describing the lifestyle of each cell.
  202: I believe that the real science book is is this one from John Leaf and is it's not a ripoff.
  205: Okay. But in any case it doesn't have to be a competition. If people want to read a new book that is not a ripoff. It's a really excellent science book because this is by a guy who I've been fought this. I've been following John leaves work for years. In addition to I'm I've been aware of Bruce Lipton's work for many years and so, I'm very familiar with both of these authors, but but if you look up John leave, he has look up his blog.
  220: So I I probably read his book, I just don't remember because but I
  226: All right. Well, no, no problem. I mean, I just like, you know, I I I just wanted to recommend that this book but if you don't want to read it, that's fine. I think it's a good book and I don't think he's I like I trust this guy, John Lee.
  229: He's been a blogger of for a long time and he's not trying to rip off and anybody, I don't believe that. I mean yeah. And I don't know why. Why? Why? That idea came out. Why can't you buy both books? You know, if you're if you want this too good books out, there's not not it's not where to take all.
  235: It's just an error psychologist. Well, so I mean, so there's a there's a book, a really good book.
  241: Have you checked out this book called the brand from inside, out by Jordi Duergi? Who says last name? I don't know how to say his first name or last name, but his initiate, but the book is caught. It's really excellent book and it's the same author who wrote rhythms of the brain.
  379: Come again. Oh, I was because I was saying, so you've been posting some really good articles recently on Facebook and I was looking at some of them and some of them from quantum magazine and so forth. But I maybe I could just ask you what, what are some of the most interesting news stories that you've been seeing lately?
  385: Other scientists. Actually, Michael Ivine is involved in complexity science. Send a books. They were to additions the first edition was that they got the skin of the frog and combined it with the heart muscle, and then they tried to put it in a petri dish and engineered it up down.
  412: So, you can just hear about those areas that I'm, you know, like I'm kind of like ignorant about. Okay, so I'll do that. Let's see, we can go ahead and so there's a group on Facebook that I'm going to reference. You don't have to visit it but I'm just that's where these articles are.
  484: Like from one place it grabs one object and place it to another or trying to get the object from someone and how the brain I mean neurons are working to booking based on the input from the eyes and input from the muscle and angle of moment. So, is it possible to know the neuron level relationship between each neuron that leads to these each unit of movement in the muscle muscular level or even the inhibition level?
  520: And basically that the Facebook patterns both basically what I'm saying is like I think that, you know, I've heard so I've heard scientists say okay well basically you know we can describe it. So audio memory stored in the brain along with the incident that happened. That's how if you want to think about something bad happened in your lifetime, it might be a visual thing or audibles thing a brain first pick up the the strongest memory that stored.
  586: And I don't know if you have read this by Michael, was it just came out like a couple years ago or something. And the book, the title of the book is the ongoing project. So it's basically saying about like this, you know, the huge emotional variances actually go out.
  589: So basically says like emotions, cannot be just a, you know, just identified in a certain pattern. So it's just a the author describes all the stories about Daniel Canaman in Alma's Tarot, Ski Rescue beer, the gray scholars were, you know, this and psychology. So I actually have have read the book and I really struggle agree.
  592: Yeah. With their stories and then argument wishes cannot be really, I didn't identify based on certain patterns, so I, I don't know. So what do you think? Well, I mean I have to read his book. I've read I pulled up this. This the undoing project. A friendship that changed our minds.
  595: Is that what is that? What it is? You're actually project actually it's the stories about you know this doctor diversity and then doctor cannot, they worked on like different projects for years and then they finally just idified that the emotions cannot be really measurable. Well, I mean, I again, I have to read the book first before I can comment on the book I think.
  598: But it's really, but I just wanted to hear about your comments about, you know, this basic notion. Yeah. From the book. Well, I mean, can you say can you say from the book? Why? What's the reason why? They're saying that that emotions can't be coming identifiable pattern. Yeah. I mean, some basic emotions, like a happiness and anger, these kind of stuff or anxiety could be measurable for sure, but it's kind of like, you know, it's just a, just a layer.

  10: It's, it's that it's that the brain is in that moment. And in order for you to see those tigers blocks, your brain has to make a graphics. And so, what my book is is proposing is an explanation of how your brain has a graphics processor that your visual cortex, the effect of the graphics processor and so, but but going beyond that.
  70: Thanks man. Appreciate it. Always good to chat with folks. I yeah, I mean I got to not get it like finished my book not just talk about it, right? So it's gonna go do some work, some real work. Okay, great.

  8: Is your reality? That's the goal of what my book sets us to do Mike. The goal of this book is to translate how cells how communication between cells. Computationally results in the reality experience. And so, we're going to take a walk through neuroscience, but also things that have been learned in history of brain, computer interfaces from external devices, to surgical surgically, implanted electrodes, electrode arrays Utah, raise DBS, deep brains stimulation and also many other different.

So those particles could represent puffy smoke. They could represent water with particles. Represent represent liquid like syrup and are in a bottle and we need booked and you turn the bottle of syrup.

    3: My book Neurons Oscillations Dendrite 
   47: The sensor to to a head net. And that would occur that would accomplish that would accomplish the goal. Okay, um, but so what I'm saying, is this is that the the, You know, the the, The so this is what so the book is like, um. Here here we have you know, I hear people in neuroscience really like extremely educated researchers, well, we'll say the brain can only recognize.
   55: They don't they don't imagine that capability exists, but, But they. So I just got this this new book by this this brilliant researcher who I've been following for more for I think maybe 20 years. And he talks about all the amazing things that the cells are doing in terms of communication.
   69: And it's wrong it's there's no such thing as synaptic unreliability and so yes, so I have the chance to revolutionize to bring a revolutionary new concept and that's sort of what the book is book is about. When you wrote your last article.
   95: So remember ready player one you read the book and and you could go into war games. Well, that is realistic. That is realistic because you could take the movie you could feed it into AI, it could. Create 3D environments and 3 representations of people from the movie frames and then you could experience the movie NVR.
  127: So that I was reading this book a rhythms of the brain that's an incredible book that summarizes like 20 years of research neuroscience research and there's a sequel and I have the sequel. So have all these great books, but like I have the best for the best books that I'm reading the best of the best books like the books that are the kings of other books and those are the books that I'm reading I read in the Kings books.
  129: And the Kings book summarize all the the lower level books all the lower level research. These are great things. But but anyway, so the thing is that the, The higher level oscillations.
  197: We need to look at basically patch clamp and there's two things one is drawn leaves book the other one is patch clamp experiments classical patch type experiments because those really dive deep into the the classical patch clamp experiments dive deep into basically the, The electoral chemical. Properties of cells is basically a patch clamp is what you use you clamp you literally like, you know, like when you you know, what a clamp is in the context of of your garage right you can clamp something onto the table, right?
  201: For my book. But now you get now you get the idea so like I have like this is so like the fundamental mechanics of the brain have been misunderstood. And I and that has affected the development of artificial neural networks. So not only can I potentially correct how the brain actually works in a fundamental way.
  265: I'll talk to about it. Okay, it doesn't this all the other. Questionable observations that he's made he makes a complete observation you're going by something that you've read in a book he's observing my medical conditions he's looking under the hood you're talking about I a general practice okay, you're making recommendations based upon what you've read, he's making recommendations based on his is actual observations of data.

b0268y ctpr.txt:
  135: Okay yeah, so the other people are making us annoying as the next fun to meet myself for a second, but um. So but I know some I'm really because there is so what I was reading very recently was this book by Peter Peter his last name is TSC and and his his book is about the criteria criteria causation or the or you know, how neurons detect patterns and and and they can kind of be reset and I think there is.
  138: I think that his book while it's very interesting is is coming into conflict with a lot of other researchers on who are at the state of the art examining the the amount of detail and so if so, I mean, there's a lot of people who are saying well, the dendrites is you know, this is capable of powerful computation by itself it's a neural network, but what exactly does that mean it, you know, some people want to reduce the neuron to what the neuron is doing is very simple and some people want to say well, it's very complex, but what is the actual degree of granularity of processing?
  144: And so the question is what was the name of that author by the way you mentioned the book Peter and his last name is TSE, so Peter the book didn't even the book is is the narrow basis of free will criteria causation and he he's making an argument that a single neuron is a is an information pattern detector that can that can and what that means is it's not just firing when it's inputs or overloaded it's not just firing it for response to it an excitatory a blast from downstream neuron.
  225: What brand areas coming from so that's maybe one consideration but and I think spines are also more prevalent in human neurons than in rodents. I'm not sure about that but it wouldn't surprise me if that's the case. So I was reading I was reading the book the rhythms of the brain and and they're talking about how basically there's um, you know with EEG, they're just Facebook yeah yeah yeah and they're talking about how you know EG there's the there's the the one over f.

b0269y ctpr.txt:
  8: So so I'm reading this in the book rhythms of the brain and I'm hearing him talk about I'm hearing F Scott saying, okay, well basically the the sodium is creating this positive wave and what happens is there's this timing thing where the potassium can either pass in it can can can comes in and it makes it negative now if you tell me now if there is something like a multi vesicle vesicle release that he didn't know about before he talked to me like he was like, he knows about he read about something called.

b0271y ctpr.txt:
  95: What's interesting is that is that in the book? On intelligence, he talks a lot about how there's their temple patterns and there are frequency patterns. And. It's really a really there's three types of temporal there's frequencies and there's phase. Pair and the thing is like, okay, so. The reason those are different is because I'm sorry no this.

   42: Okay. So imagine that there's a book right? And the podcast. History. History from 10,000 years ago. I history there was stuff you dreamed about like people walking through a canyon. I'm just saying stripes of people. And. Looking at me. Hey. Jereart to California. People who lived in. The walls the desert, right?
  168: It. I mean, it's learning what it's going to fire for sequence is going to fire for so it's like it's job is true a focused sequence learn to sequence and a books. Save us. But it's good morning.

  15: Well you have a transcript later and I don't have to pay anybody for this transcript so I can play my old audio interviews and it will transcribe them for me. That's pretty good so so I've been reading some books let me show you some neuroscience books. There's just book called my Kindle.
  21: This they're both made they both of these books are from the same author. But he's talking about brain oss layers and I read I read the book. I'm like learning so much, but like I already have the thing is look. I have a I have a hypothesis about how the brain works.

b0278y ctpr.txt:
  16: Facebook. The entire self.
  70: The in terms of like anyway so it's it's interesting how how different the brain is compared to like a like the deep neural networks that you see in Facebook today, but I think that so going to what I want to make is like basically the kind of machine that you know it the will be capable of general intelligence like generalizing anything so any concept that a human being can understand it can understand so like anything your dog can understand.

b0282y ctpr.txt:
   49: Okay, so complex topic. So probably the most important thing to before starting on a complex topic is to talk about definitions and I can tell you a little bit from the neuroscience side of it and I guess through many like introductory neuroscience textbooks and cognitive neuroscience textbooks. I think the best one I've come across mentioning consciousness kind of.
   51: Textbooks trying to explain like where neuroscience is out from the in that terms in these terms and so one textbook. I remember said something about well consciousness could really be. To find this kind of like four different things you know, there's like are you conscious or not conscious like when you're like a sleeper versus you're you're awake, you know, so you're like, oh we can wear and there's other times that it's used one is to describe sort of this meta awareness of the fact that you yourself are thinking and so I think in many of these like discussions we have clubhouse or wherever like that's a common one that most people are talking about is that definition of consciousness, but then when the discussion, Progresses some other people's sort of give the sort of coming at it from like the other definition we're like, you know, and so these things I'll just get mixed up and so if I mean, I don't know who follows super closely but if you notice the field itself consciousness on the work consciousness, so you don't know circumstances about like consciousness because it's sort of like it'
   57: In the the book the huge book on cognitive neuroscience, this is the mind body problem is the name of the chapter and then it starts consciousness so that's defined consciousness consciousness thoughts and feelings awareness, the term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness of what consciousness means many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with self-consciousness to be conscious it is.
   63: Age of about it some people took he was doing science when he wrote that book and trying to define limitations of perceptrons where this is impossible nothing what has been written about it and whatever exactly the same language and and 30 years later machine learning is working despite everything that he said so this.
  131: So yeah, that's that's that's pretty sophisticated system but it's no local. I would suggest the book. It's called. The leaving that that describes non-local decisions made by insects and I mean a simple example will be a type of wasp that has surgical precision in injecting into the brain of a category some kind of a I don't know what is some kind of neural agent that paralyzes it then it goes and injects its eggs into the caterpillar the eggs are fed by the caterpillar then.
  133: The future wasps if it is at some point an acid that breaks through the skin of the caterpillar they come out and and and this is always extremely sophisticated precision in in many steps the book is full with examples that are no local and they cannot be explained with simple combination questions because what you mean by so in the case of if you want to die perhaps it wasps latter if you wanted.
  155: Remember all the strategies yeah sure right? I mean it basically solves the Markov chains equations in order to find the highest probability of success in so many steps etc, etc, these are not things that the machine is conscious about it was the human who decided this is going to be the objective function we're going to be well, maybe I should just open the artificial intelligence book on I mean, It is 17 is anyone claiming that alpha go is conscious.
  157: ⟪ 1033 characters skipped ⟫our Artificial consciousness right that the word consciousness is there and my point for all of this and I take mucous criticism as valid is that whatever we are saying is written on the pages of the book by Parasso and Norway the new version and it's like chapter 16 17 and 18 of how to make alpha gold do the things that you do and it says making simple decisions the basic of utility theory utility functional multivariate utility functions decision network chapter 17.

I also I write software including software for brain computer interfaces and virtual reality. And I am I'm currently writing a book that is about the brain about neuroscience and and brain computer interfaces.

    39: I work I booked in genomics and also on clinical trial and so on so yeah and I haven't worked directly on. However many techniques that I use in machine learning actually applied in Windows.
   160: I don't maybe Katerina can speak to this but but, My question actually to Katarina is not only that but but also about stimulation so so so someone said someone said that a neuroscientist in another group said that neuralink is probably going to move around I read in the book rhythm of the brain that these brain computer interfaces can't move around every time you breathe including like the the the kind of electrodes they call what is it like it's something like try electrodes I forget but um, But they they can move around a lot and that means if you're trying to stimulate the brain.
   404: ⟪ 290 characters skipped ⟫k so we're talking about the basically we're talking about neurophysics and nerve care but specifically how numenta and neuralink sort of overlap how basically the that that the big idea from the new book of from the mentor talks about how cortical columns may be used to represent what you're seeing and hearing and and, And what you're what you're touching and how all of them are, you know different areas of cortex and but they're all sort of linked together and so they'll vote and and and and and then that will be how your brain can represent objects to you but the thing is quote-to-coms are in reach of of neuralink and and other brain computer interface technologies, which is why we're talking about, you know, the deep the potential for for decoding our thoughts and and our our, What we can see in here, so I'll go ahead and pass it back to we some.
   749: We came about because there's a lot of overlap between the two and the new book a thousand brains. I read it it. I also read about the basically the court the eight say I read this and actually 2017 so he's the main idea which is about the cortical columns are organizing all the information that you're perceiving like every like if you have a table every object on the table would be managed by a different cortical column, but not only that like if you, It like if you have here now if you have your phone for example because it's a great example because we're all on Clubhouse so if you have if you have your phone you're gonna have maybe a thousand core columns in the visual cortex that are modeling your phone and I I confirm with Jeff Hawkins.
  1065: Question that I have is that I think with the like I said with the rampant use of you know invasive techniques to read on neuronal signals you think we can actually make an event on a near basketball coupling because that's also one of the things that's been left to you know on Facebook techniques like using FNS and whatnot the F nearest with EEGs and they have you know, different convolutional problems but with invasive techniques you would think that we can remedy that situation and land.

I mean, they were precursors of this technology there are papers that we can point to and and so I mean, I do have a group that of course people can join the group is on Facebook has the same title as this talk so if you type the title of this talk into Facebook, you see a group with about nine thousand people 9,900 people and but but yeah, we've got lots of papers and Of course if you if you need more papers you can ask and we'll get we'll get them for you but yeah so like what it so you know, so you're gonna have a lot of people are gonna want to talk about those you're gonna have a lot of people gonna want to ethics discussions legal discussions what laws we do we want to pass and and in a lot of scientists we're gonna want to talk about this like houses how soon is this coming what what are the sort of like technology hurdles that in in science hurdles that we need to do to get to this point and The thing that won't happen is it won't won't be stopped and and that's because it solves too many problems it solves too much human pain it's solves too much disease and so when you have a lot of people who are in pain and they have diseases, they're money is going to be at the forefront of their concerns so they're going to be paying into th

I don't know that's I don't know it's there's a discussion has to be had but but I'm not in Europe, so it's but I mean, I don't know what will happen in the US.

  1708: Peter this last name is TSC I should really just figure out remember I should remember how to pronounce the name. I because I talk about his book all the time. And so he has this there are basis for you. I was like, you're neurons are detecting information and they're they're the neurons in coordination they're detecting like the basic basic roots of information and the in the cortical columns are taking these detections and and so this is so in some sense neurons and and neuro circuits are reacting to incoming information.
  1762: This which is actually almost precede the first computers. So this has been around but but a good paper for that maybe maybe the numeric or maybe there's like a books about like synaptic organization in the brain, etc. So, um, Yeah many things yeah. I cannot like point to one.
  1765: Yeah. I know I I get it now. I am you're talking about. Okay, I think there was a sorry just remember there was a book that was kind of emphasizing this on this kind of micro. Market sacred thing. I thought about the name of the person I'll pay later but as I suddenly maybe momenta because they try to give the they work is kind of.

I think it's put up a UCSD is called Niro science and it actually is an 800-page textbook that I'm currently reading and it will pretty much has all the answers that Mica well not all of them but pretty much how neurons work and you know, the actual all the structures of was that book again, it's called nearest science.
  265: Of our of other cells and you know all the way up to present, you know techniques I guess of yeah, I guess like pet and MRIs and stuff like that is the author Dale perms yeah or that guy okay, um, yeah there's a there's another book that if you like that book there's another book that you probably would would think is really cool it's called rhythms of the brain.
  269: So yeah yeah, it's edited by Gale purse and George Augustine. And I'm like a quarter of the way through with that and then I'm gonna check out the book that you just recommended like I think yeah, I think you like it for for the basically the same reasons it covers a lot of the same material probably.

    3: regarding the book "A thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins"
   57: And obviously I love to book a thousand brains and my feeling is that you probably got it right there is this very general algorithms throughout the cortex that's doing different jobs and that can be stacked together to be more abstract and it's really great but my question will maybe fall into a similar category as previous two persons, which is there are certain things that I haven't been able to conceive of using reference frames, so I'll give you an example so say I think about the problem of why?
   75: Now part of your question was like how do I relate to my personal actions right I'm not actually doing something when I'm imagining the things and the argument I made in the book and I can only make it a certain level today. I can't go too far with it.
   84: I'm saying here is an operator that I'm going to say which is like a movement and when I do that I go to some new locations. In math in the game in the book, they can example the math of attics and you can think of like a mathematical operator is like a physical movement.
  108: I also make a point in the book that we can learn that things that affect can be applied to different type of different reference trains. I use example of this history you can take a set of historical facts you can align them along a one reference frame, which is the timeline.
  114: When you're when you're all touching and seeing and hearing the same thing, but when we're relying on language, it's easy to get that confused. You just hope there's a whole bunch of concepts there that's great thank you yeah thank you right down. I'm gonna take a bold guess you're from China and Jeff's first book intelligence, there's actually quite a cult following in China, oh yeah.
  117: I'm sorry yes so so once Jeff's a thousand bring a Chinese version come out we might have to do a Chinese version of discussion. I don't yeah. That's great. I've heard this story quite a bit but around the world actually it always makes me nervous because in the book a not intelligence I made a call to action I said, you know, why don't you come and get in this field it's gonna be exciting and and then when people actually did it.
  120: I'm like, oh my gosh. I hope this is working out for you. I'm nervous I can tell you going to neuroscience conferences you know back when we went physics to these conferences It's really fun walking around with Jeff at these conferences because you can hardly take two steps before someone comes in and says, oh I'm in this field because of you and you know read the book as it's really quite fun to walk around the you know, it is nerve-racking to hear that and we hope people's careers turn out well and hope they're happy.
  123: On the other hand, you know, I think that's the goal of this book, right? They call it my new book is to say my gosh evens even a better time again because we made so much. If you want to build machines that work on these principles. Is this really going to happen?
  126: And if you're young it's going to happen in your lifetime, you know in the and so it's one of the reasons I wrote the book I guess is to get more people excited about it get them get an engage because there's so many really smart people out there and you know, just trying to get some of their minds sure, you know.
  129: Yeah, thank you so much Chris you're next and Mill Alexis and Mika Jory, thank you so much for your patience, we'll get to you Chris you're up. I Jeff so my question is related to chapter 9 in your book which is titled when machines are conscious. So, of course the interesting property of consciousness for me at least is how when I actively observed what is in my consciousness and I am aware that I am attending to those contents it feels like something it feels like an, Experience and this is my conscious awareness.
  219: I think it's that natural outcome of this it's a selfless on avoidable. Almost an advantage point, thank you Mel because thank you so much I everyone I  and so so my name is Micah Bloomberg and like many people apparently that you've met my life was changed after I read the book on intelligence co-authored by Jeff I guess he was the the main speaker though.
  222: I've watched I've read both of the books. I've watched so many of the videos talks that Nementa has shared including many of the detox by Jeff. And in many of the the other ones too I want to say I should I should probably talk a little faster so I I've studied neuroscience and computer science since then including computational neuroscience neural networks.
  225: I became a computer programmer since then I maintain a couple of open source projects. I have a group on Facebook called self aware networks, it's pretty cool a deep learning group on Facebook has 147,000 members neurophysics group, no neurosurgeon group. I did the neural lace podcast actually wants to ask the people if I can interview.
  292: AI that AI as I think you propose in your book are it's simply a reasoning machine like the Neocortex and our our the things that drive our emotion the old brain the fight or flee impulse which is how geared towards our user survive. Those are kind of our that's the dangerous part of our brain and our and so my question is like where does the desire to know things come from like your passion to understand the brain and the, Pleasure you get for that it seems like to me the the older brain is geared with Maslow's lower needs the heck, you know, the shelter food things like that survival and that's where the fear impulse comes from clearly the hatred but the the noble side of the brain is just not the neoportex the things that we've invented like ideas like law or the ten commandments, but we saw value in them as ways of constraining the whole brain constraining a impulses and emotions and doesn't.
  313: I can't give you pictures on those Mark. Weiss, hi Mark our friend of ours I see you so his question about a basically about ethical constructs. I the basic idea and a ladies out of the book is that the new cortex itself is essentially devoid of these it's anything that the word of any sort of built-in emotional constructs.
  325: Only what conditions if I'm, Relying on something maintaining my with my you know habitat on Mars the example I use in the book a much times I don't want it you know experimenting much you know I don't really well to try new things too often. I want to go out there and get the job done of the other hand if I'm building a mathematician robot.
  337: And so the example I give in the books. I will come is that you can have something that's Um agent on the internet. Essentially following links and going to different web pages and sensing what's there and learning a model of something but it doesn't have to be physical. There's still a concept of movement in sensation.
  514: You know the symptoms I do feel comfortable talking about that. Um but you know, I think in a book you talk a lot about how knowledge is represented and how the binding problem is can be solved yeah not sure if that's the same thing, you know, we think they're used to as a it's a very convenient substrate for storing knowledge, you know, I don't know about meaning per se but knowledge can be stored is stored in the brain in reference frames and you can make inferences about about that knowledge you can make predictions about that knowledge, you know, so there's a lot of Capabilities you get from storing yeah data on in reference frames per se but yeah may not get to your question but first of all these reference range we know how you're done to the brain, there were these things which have been studied for decades in and we actually know a lot how this is done, it's not totally this is not made up speculation stuff, but as I said, what reference frames give you is the way of organizing knowledge about something in a useful way, it is makes it actionable it makes it say that I c
  524: Thank you. Oh thanks as thank you so much Jeff and Super. Ty this has been such a rich discussion and the book is called a thousand brains and I highly encourage all of you to to get a book and read and prepare your mind get blown and the research platform called new mental that super title ads leads all the using the theory applying artificial intelligence, and as I mentioned the new mental website is it's a treasure trove of interested in those.
  527: Other topics I guess Jeff and Strubetai this I think this is a good place to end the discussion we can leave the room and people in the room can continue the discussion and the I guess the best way to learn more is to visit new mental website and also read the book.

b0307y.md:
  12: Right, right, right? So so I guess um, you're right those are two different two to very different things. So the main body of the book is in neuroscience and writing about different research that has been done and linking together ideas that people are perhaps not yet linking together in a public way, maybe they might be linking them together privately but I want to show basically a, Science-based neurology-based map of existing research, but combining some together some novel ideas in order to.
  21: It's not doing it's not coming close yet to what needs to be done and then exploring the kinds of things that we would need to see in machine learning in order to. Basically be able for for for a computer to have the kinds of capability that that our brains have and so that is like in a sense the second book is like taking the lessons from neuroscience and then applying them to computation to computer science to say okay, well here's what we're here's what's happening in the brain and here's what's happening in deep learning and here's what's happening in, you know, all these other kinds of machine learning programs and here's here's what we could do that would sort of change things like the like the, The so right these are two different stories but it's like saying okay, well how can I how can I understand the the computational aspect of of of cognitive neurology cognitive psychology cognitive of cognition right the computational aspect of it and then how can I replicate it mechanically so I I'm I'm in the those two so this isn't the style of like a book like like on intelligence by Jeff Hawkins, for example where he basically did.
  27: And I I'm I'm so that is a certain that's like a book style I think to to where I'm going to be talking about with the brain does but like the whole brain not just the neocortex so the neocortex included but basically near neocortexist is the most it's it's it's the top two-thirds of the of the brain it's it's the biggest part of the human brain but it is like but my the theory that I have is about explaining the whole brain right it's so I that's what I'm aiming to do is.

b0308y.md:
   15: Yeah, so so that book by the way, so I so we were listening to an excerpt from a book called rhythms of the brain.
   18: And what I did was a certain points, so I was just having my kindle I was having Alexa read from my Kindle at the point that I was in the book and but while we were listening to that I started I started making notes and I could I could share some of those notes with folks if you want like I took screenshots and I'm sort of like, I'm super interested because I've been doing things like around the house and with the dog and everything so I didn't make any notes so please all right, so I'm just like looking at this one note right here, so the one consequence of decreased interconnectedness and larger brands is the increased segregation of the neuronal pool.
   21: So Ringo 1991 suggested that this segregation may be the force for more specialization in larger brains. For example, the functional differences between hemispheres. And then let's see. Remember what? It's like so like I'm learning to use the highlighter in the book when I do screenshots because like sometimes it's like oh what did I say that for do you ever have that okay let's see oh yeah, so it's interesting to hear that so basically the neuroscientist didn't invent in a sense they didn't I guess I didn't invent EEG it's basically like it's basically like the same sort of.
   54: And this is kind of what he was saying Cactus is almost exactly what he's saying, which is made which makes me think he read this exact book. No, he's been hologram. Good. Oh, no. I was just asking like is it such a feat to construct three deholographically from the two dimensional imaging?
   81: ⟪ 359 characters skipped ⟫r sound like a lot of people have been asking questions like well how clear is how's the spatial resolution of of you know, EG versus you know, eCog versus nerlase and here we got this like this this book really just like whenever there's like okay, here's here's all these questions that that you're gonna be asking in the year 2020 one on Clubhouse and here's all the answers and they're all in this book and on top of that, we're gonna we're gonna tell you about the special resolution of MEG and And all these other different centers too as like, oh great that's what good time good timing.
   84: I don't want to slide track too much from tonight, but I am wondering. If you. Consider doing a book club to do like maybe like a weekly chapter by chapter and you know just to try and get like a really broad brought away array of perspectives on it and and because as you said, I think this all does relate to so many topics that I find myself in.
   87: Yeah, so I mean, I well, I'm gonna be careful because it's like, you know, but I've been thinking about that a lot actually because. Because you see this through there are people who are doing they're trying to do book clothes right but what they're doing is I'll go ahead they're gonna like take turns reading the book and then and they don't get to it and then you go back the next week and it's a different book, you know, how did you get through an entire book yeah, so you go back the next day in a different book so I can different book every day it's too much jumping around.
   90: I think great has a pretty good layout so like I'm in I I'm in that book club for my skin Minsky's society of mine, oh and it's it's had you know, Has been everybody's taking turn will not everybody but you know maybe half a dozen people each week taking turns reading chapter sections and then usually several hours of discussion but it's been going pretty smoothly as a model where it you know, we're getting through a chapter each week and then of course there's the discussion for several hours and then there's the after party discussions for several more hours and then there's the part, you know part two after parties.
   96: To to try to do it do it well. Um, okay so so tetrodes when this came up this was really cool because um, this almost has like a direct the the direct correlation to to neuralink and it's sort of like I felt like this part of the book really kind of like explained, um, What they were trying to solve with within their link in terms of like.
  156: But we process things not an analog way but any discrete way and I still have a app that we have these a lot of neuroscience groups and people will say things like well humans don't like we don't know what consciousness is and and and everything to say I don't know because cuz there's a lot that I whenever that's that's the whole point of what I'm writing but anyway so here so here is um the book that I'm writing.
  159: I'm writing a book that basically points out the human that I believe human beings have with the current reads. To have already solved the consciousness is but if you look at this article that I just pay posted on Twitter and put hang on let me hit it right now, okay so that article is humans are metal robots in about scents here's the thing so we thank you yeah yeah, so this is like this is full of research papers, but I reference I didn't just like this is not like I didn't reference like some holy book this is like there's a research paper in here like written by it major scientists, and one of the things that comes up is is that, The brain processes information and discrete steps discrete forms so here so at point number three the brain is digital it's not analog it processes the screen information like a computer a recent paper changes the dominant paradigm of neuroscience relates 50 years, so that was in May 4th of 2018, but what's interesting is?
  162: He's saying that in this book and his book predates that paper so I I so that's really cool for me because now that there's an older source now. I need to like, um, I believe in he put the reference in the back of the book so I think I I've made have to go back and get the source or I did already took a screen shot.
  165: I don't know but but, Yeah, that's really cool um, so my article references a later source and his book as much older so I have to have to change the after doing updates okay, no actual credit for for the origin of the human brain processing things in a discrete step another thing the take the cue.
  168: Defragger and um, The second edition has all of the new footnotes you found since the first yeah yeah this this book is this book is one of the best books. I mean, I've read some great books this book is one of the best books that I've read so far.
  171: I'm really excited about this book and I'm really excited about the sequel to this book because it is just like it's shock full of like great references and clear writing and has his broad scope covers of vast number of topics. I mean, I so I mean, I also have on my Kindle I have the I have the the book when I was I started reading about how he in early part of the book that wasn't in the call today.
  174: Earlier this week. I think yesterday I was reading about his he was talking about the the how the brain is constructed, um how then how the network the network the network of the brain is constructed and and I was like this sounds like Olaf's porns and I like so I was born this book is also my kindle it's another book that I've read part of the way through and I'm still finishing but I flipped back to Olaf's forms and I'm reading it as a yeah, this is like this is like he's the same.
  177: It's a lot of same ideas here and then it and then and then I flipped it back to this book and he mentions allow spores like five or six times as oh, okay so all right, you know, where where what time zone are you in you should jump in on the the minsky book club.
  186: On the on the Minsky book club for society of mind comes at it. You do consider sending me at the time the time to show up on Twitter and I'll let it remind me if you oh yeah yeah yeah, so when one thing is like, um, you know, like I love it when people like the Chopin a group that where the topic is neuroscience and people will say scientists have no idea what quality is it's this magical thing and we don't like magic and all the stuff here it is unpaid here it is like and in the pages it says if so then one over f dynamics maybe the functional architecture of underlying quality support.
  189: Okay. So no it has been covered the people this isn't this isn't neuroscience it it's not something that is magical this is a like a actual thing that they cover in a neuroscience textbook okay, so and on top of that like, you know, I was looking at this reference for um, Basically this guy he talks about this like five or six times I think during this turn this recorded call he says so Labette was this, um, you know disguised he's saying that basically they caught the conscious experience requires the engagement of the appropriate brain networks for hundreds of milliseconds and like yeah, I've heard this idea before right right like so like if someone is unconscious or someone is conscious like it's like okay, what's the difference, you know of all these anti physiologists with their their theories of the brain leaving the body, it's very amazing but but then it's like yeah, but Okay, so but what is more precisely what's different right and what what about when I'm awake and there's some things I'm not contrast of and some things that I am conscious of like what you know, there's um, You know, how does something go from you know being something that's outside my aw
  192: Like I told you I'm okay. I know I'm sorry. These ideas right there's still a lot of good debate to be had. Um but uh and there was there was a bit of a joke there in there but I but at the point I said like um yeah there's like this book is shock full like great references right it's one of the best on the my major point by saying that and and the other thing was that this book is just amazing for like this the scale of all the different topics that it covers and all the different research papers that it covers and and like the you know, when I pointed out that basically it like this is this whole chapter sounds like the entire like he's summarized it the entire work of Olaf sports, this is great and it's and and then he references a lot of Cyber six times there's just magnificent he's like this is like this book is like if you could if you could take you know, 20 years of 20 plus 20 plus a year that I don't know 200 plus years of neuroscience really because your hands burger is it and and there was this whole point in the beginning when he's talking about, you know, Cajal and you know, the the guy who one of the guys who like was who like in first like in the 1800s Ramon and and as in his rival could you all were both like, you know, the first to be they were staining neurons, so they could Image basically that they had they drew all these like they made these drawings basically or I don't know if they were like, um prints or something from there from staining neurons as they basically.
  198: Of neuroscience in this book except that this book is outdated and there's a newer book though, so this book is like so I don't know what what year it was released, but it's just. Seeing type it up rhythms. Our age why rhythms of the brain? By the way, so we're the brain was.
  201: What year was it? If anyone gets their faster go ahead and shot at the answer what year was the book.
  207: Wow. I think you can get the book for free right now. I think it's on the web for free. Wow, okay, let me show the link. Okay like everyone if you're still here, you can have a copy of the book that the Twitter was just there's just being read for free.
  213: And I'm going to cover this. Wow, that is awesome. Awesome for you guys. I bought a car. I bought a coffee. I think my coffee was 40 bucks, but yeah, if you look at my Twitter right now, that is the that's the book right there that we were just playing.
  216: Yeah and I did not see the year when I was checking that out so it's the year was it was published in 2006 so this is an old book 2006 for neuroscience, but it is just great and then he's got a newer book so like I'm after I've been with this I think come back so here so this is a remark, this is another note that I took this is a remarkable observation he says in essence the claim is that a collective pattern recorded from a small portion of the cortex looks like a pattern recorded from the hole.
  222: And so that knocked my socks off. I did not expect that to be in this book and that gave me huge smiles because. The model three-dimensionally even you know, just holographic whatever because. Yeah, so many reasons yes. I'm with you big smiles feel lots of validation love and that yes, all right, so let's see another note that I took was the recorded signal in fact may contain more information about the observer's brain state than about the input because the process is an interpretation or construction rather than a reflection to use terms borrowed from psychology in order to predict the president's state of the brain one needs to have access to recent history.
  228: Psychophysics psychophysics psychopathy so that so the name of this group was almost neurophysics and I changed at the last second took out the physics part but then he comes because I have a group also on Facebook, it's called narrow physics. And. But he said psychophysics has a great second what does that hey I looked it up and and it is so neurophysics here is you know, when we're talking about hands burger and EEG and like the actual you know, that oscillations of the brain that this is the topic of neurophysics cycle physics where we're now like we're not only talking about neurophysics, but we're comparing the neurophysics to someone's real robotic world real world experiences so psychophysics is like the real world we're trying to interpret what a person's real life experiences.
  231: To to the neurophysics of their brain which is like really interesting because it's like I wasn't aware of that term which is something I got and it's very valuable so I can almost like rename the the the thing about rename renaming the the the book and actually the group and on Facebook from narrow physics plus to something else and I was gonna go something like neurophysics plus nerve gear plus brain press, sorry plus brain waves plus rhythms plus oscillations and something like that, but it.
  234: And but I I haven't really settled on. What to name it and all of a sudden there's this new name psychophysics, so neurophysics and psychophysics psychophysics includes neurophysics right wow and then um and and then, uh, The point was that the, The thing is like well the recorded signal is okay, so the record of signal is not what you just saw right now he says in the book in order to predict the present state of the brain what needs to have access to its recent history so what he's saying is like the the signal that you're seeing in the brain the the neurophysics that you're detecting with your with your brain sensors with your neural link or your you know, your other brain computer interface that doesn't represent what you're seeing in that moment that represents the room and Everything that happened in the last you know minute maybe could be everything like the table the chair the the mirror the wall yeah like all of that stuff is part of the brain signal, so you have to take whatever's happening right now.
  294: ⟪ 408 characters skipped ⟫ved to have like a slower time scale and then over time as you get up to the neocortex the time scale it gets faster right it sort of like an evolutionary site a perspective that he brought up in the book was that that when We were when you know, if you go back in time organisms, didn't we need didn't need to move very fast they need to need to move very much because the food was plentiful and in life was easy and as things got as things got harder organisms became much more highly coordinated and had much bigger brains because it had to trial a lot harder to get food.
  339: So so so yeah, so he was like yeah, so the brain has all this oscillation happen. I'll just regularity happening and all these like regular patent patterns, which is something I read about in another book. Work basically, you know, he was saying yeah, it looks people are saying that that was happening temporally, sorry.
  357: I mean, like didn't think I didn't think of this exact phrase like it like yeah, of course it seems obvious but that phrase and it hadn't come in. So this is like, I love this book. Okay, so I think that we're about the robot at the end. So Mark Penton and reason that if we found a quantifiable relationship among the power bands came versus theta.
  366: Lands for that for that group. And so, this is this again, this is like such a good book. And if you checked my Twitter earlier and followed me on Twitter, you've got some good information today, and I generally post good information there, so you know follow if you want.
  372: Thank you everybody. Well, thanks for doing this. I've downloaded the book. I am going to have more time to sit down and pick through the notes that you've posted. I really appreciate it. All right. So, I think someone came on up. So someone's here you go ahead and speak.
  396: So would you be able? To see some groups, you know on Facebook that you recommended to you you are admin of.
  405: ⟪ 663 characters skipped ⟫somebody the last two hundred years of neuroscience in the last 20 years of of deep learning and and and every subject that's in between you could definitely check out my neurophysics group on on Facebook for starters, and and look at the the files that I should.

   11: It's positive aspect of. Having a certain kind of neural. I'm not I'm optimistic about that idea. I I'd like to say that I am sometimes. I'll be real a book a book kind of book that I'm getting through for example is his is a rhythms of the brain and also I'm alternating that with networks of the brain by Orloff's forms and.
   14: And I'm listening to I'm reading it on a Kindle and I am got the audio going and but but it's like every 10 minutes I get distracted by something and if I if I could have a neural link that would like sort of like predict when I'm about to get distracted and like pull me back in and and help me to focus that on the book, you know, basically by by creating a simulation that countered that distraction like before I became aware of it and and because I'm sure the neural activity of the distraction is happening before.
   62: So what you said about simulating many different neurons not having any control over it and it being a very blunt instrument. I I was I was just reading the the pause section of the the the book rhythms of the brain where they were talking about how if you had if the brain had only excitatory neurons or basically if it if there was no inhibition if then it would just like excite itself, you know, endlessly until it became exhausted and in the whole.
  197: Like a pretty strong claim to say we'll be doing it in 20 years when we don't even know if it's a feasible like like whether you know a proof of concept even I see well, I mean, you know, I I think there is evidence to it and in fact that's the the book that I'm writing right now is that there actually is evidences so maybe there maybe there are some things you haven't reviewed yet, that's what I would suggest back a little bit on both sides here, uh, so I'll push towards the middle, um, so, uh the most Uh, similar thing we have to being able to stimulate individual neurons in an intact brain of a mouth of a something that we have genetic control would be something that's been around for maybe recent and that's slim and so with two photon imaging.
  227: So the hypothesis of my book is that basically this is, Already been solved if you looked at the research as a whole and the second thing that was was about how David talks about how stimulating the tongue like if you attach a camera until to someone's head and knew you why are the the pixels to an electrode stimulus pack on their tongue or on their back they'll begin that person will begin to see through the camera if they're blind to begin to see like the crude image which is basically their brain converting the electrodes that are on their back or their tongue into an image but because as electrode stimulus represents the stimulus from the pixels on the camera, and there's also a case.

   303: Oh, yes, Brian. Roth, yep. He has a grant to work on that. The thing about about creating synthetic biology books creating synthetic molecules for things such as psychedelics is that. There is it's a real question of receptor and agonist fit and getting the molecules to fit exactly right if possible and trying to get them to be as specific to the receptor that we want to activate as possible.
   482: But you can look up the topic of neutropics. And so some people with who have ADHD, they have MRIs again, they have like less blood flow. In the in the frontal parietal lobes, for example I and like it's like I think Jay held mentioned ADHD. I should definitely like to some good books on AST that that you might want to read but but also I get your diagnosis validated because there's two there's too many like there's many things that can appear to be ADHD or ADD that.
  1059: I also, Catch on people's vibes are very quickly and so that's what I had to add to that and I've done speaking thank you make a what do you have to say about Carl's course Carl's to say. Well you're both bringing up interesting thoughts right now because I am reading a book called rhythms of the brain at the moment and and that book talks a lot about the fact that we in order for our thoughts to in order for our thoughts and behaviors to be coordinated we need a we need a conductor with there needs to be like a basically like essentially like almost like a centralized rhythm maker that is like a like the conductor when orchestra that is is like, you know, okay this happens then this happens and then this happens and they have to happen at the Right time in order for it things to work and so there has to the brain has to be like, you know with its electromagnetic field basically not only it's not it's not it's it's not enough that we have one part of us that is generating thing and we have a bunch of different parts of us that are generating things, but all these all these things have to together sort of like have a sort of.
  1169: Like those difficult to learn anything about radar when I was first trying to understand or figure out this problem like there was like one set of lectures and a few books and most of the resources that I was able to get was. Through the the pirate day of the enough and most of the servers were hosted in universities.
  1172: I may or military bases so I was like, what is this kind of weird like you guys are hosting a book about radar technology in the server near a military base in the US. I was like this seems like some sort of like, I don't know any pot or something but using those texts and, Reading about it more allowed me to advance closer to this problem.
  1354: You can find more information about it there. It's the center for intelligent antennas and radio systems at the University of Waterloo Canada. It's okay. I see us. So it seems like you're familiar with arithmetic machine and I was wondering if there's anything like there's you know books of frequencies associated with different, you know diseases and what not I've no idea if it's there is no there is no such database we're in fact building such a database that's one of the exciting things about this.

   381: A sort of vague idea and in but we're but you brought it to a very specific the specific area of study that is not it's not high level, you know book stuff for for you know, someone looking for self-improvement you're talking about something very, you know, it's very specific and very medical and and and so, you know, I'm, I'm just thinking like okay well it is is a big part of this just having to do with how the brain is able to make new memories.
   444: Right on so I so I guess I'll share it since yeah. I'm gonna record and publish this so I'll share some of my ideas. So, I think that. So I so I I'm going with the hypothesis that a bit of information in the brain is is a coincidence pattern, you know because a so there's there's a the book the note basis of free will by Peter TSC.
   495: So I thought it was really interesting in the book by Jeff Hocking's called I don't know if anyone here has read it his new book is called does anyone know the name of his book new book? I'm blanking on the name. I just happened let me type in the computer real quick to hocking's.
   522: I'm you just mentioned in the book.
   667: That's what I remember, but it was funny so then I write so then like when I was an adult, I read this book called. On intelligence by Jeff Hawkings and that really changed my life and because then I had this idea about how the neocortex could could how we create a an artificial neocortex thanks to Jeff Hawkins book and he just really has a really great way of explaining some some concepts and not it's not that his book is is a hundred percent original.
   682: Many other people those are the three big names but there's many others they they all read neuroscience, they're not like ignoring neuroscience right the end they all read Jeff Hawkins book and everything and computational neuroscience, it's just that it's just that they're they're really they're not trying to to produce they're trying to try and they're not they're not trying to be too biologically plausible but they are they are trying to study to look for the principles of intelligence and so to end and in both approaches.
   697: And okay, so welcome to Carl and Dr. Olu I'll just meet myself and give each of you a chance to take a turn to to speak. Okay, thank you because I I Imigo or Michael I usually say mica, okay bye. I am a silent supporter so whenever you think that the room is not as full as you might like just think that I'm I'm a peacock admirer of yours, so anyway, so I am I have begun to read this book called on intelligence.
   721: I just picked it up in a bookstore and, Then he says even touch is actually time series information because he pure to just touch something and without moving the hand try to figure out what it is. It's very hard. It's only by slowly and gently the progressing the surface with your pivots that you begin to ascertain exactly what type of surface it is.
   724: And so and then sound is by nature time series even the visual signal if it's moving we're much more perceptive about it rather than a stationary image. And then so yeah, so that's that's as far as I understand so far. I haven't. So I I read that book a long time ago and that was like I said that was a book that changed my life.
   727: So I understand a lot about that book but um, but what I guess what I didn't understand is what you were taught what you were saying and maybe just restate what you're saying about about the brain singing.
   736: I think they the book that you you refer to on the intelligence that's a first it was a book by Jeff Hawkins in 2005 and the other book that the thought thousand brain it is actually a I think a newer version yeah, so I think you might want the interested to get the top one as well, so the the time series I might I'm my own.
  1148: Making another correction process. Mine yeah so if you want if you really want to geek out and cool next generation ideas, he's he's I think his books are up there with like, um, you know with like William Gibson's novels with them like the matrix and we're just like we're just waiting for someone to create like the equivalent of the matrix films but based on the the Rama's nom novels and X's novels.
  1978: ⟪ 289 characters skipped ⟫ink about it but I'm the first thing I would just like to mention to Grant when you mention about the universe and mathematics, I'm pretty sure you read or you're familiar with Mark's Mark Techmark's books and not our 
  1982: No, I haven't I only know Stephen Rolfe from one. That someone said earlier Christ for Christ's sake going by the book now or get the audio book or yeah right now. Oh our mathematical universe by Mark Tegmark. Next Egmont Amazing Read and he has another follow-up called Life 3.0 will talk to one of my friends.
  1985: I have I have that book. One of my buddies like really wanted me to get it. I'll get the book you just show it right now. So read mathematical universe first because I think it's a better sequence of doing this but he but but yeah, he's so he talks all about how everything we know every single concept can be translated into mathematics from the most biological concept of the most abstract concept.
  1994: I forget which um, You know scientific author was talking about this but basically I part of me really thinks what will happen is that humans will almost have like a father figure so to speak of. It's like, you know, you're living we're not we're not like slaves to this computer but knowing purpose so they well what's what's this book said talks so this guy talks about that there are three possibilities possibility number one, which is the one that everyone scared of is that they will take over and will be slaves possibility number two.

    1: b0313y This NOTE was important to me because I was speaking with a group of people on Clubhouse about Neuralink and what it really means and people were really receptive, I felt that my take on Neuralink was eye opening to other people based on their feedback and so I intended to use this audio note in particular in the book the copy out my description of the Neuralink, and what it means in the historical sense.
    3: Please note that audio notes were auto transcribed with neural networks via Google Recorder, and then I put them into Google Docs to run an automatic grammar check. So what you are reading is NOT exactly what was originally said. That is why I am sharing it in my notes but I will not share this in this form in my book.
   70: I'm an admin for the Self Aware Networks group on Facebook, and Neurophysics + NerveGear, and other groups related to neuralace / nerve gear / neural link. These are all basically referring to the same idea: the next generation brain interface. That group is really old. It's older than the neural link. I write software if you just look at my bio I brought EEG into VR so we basically have medical imaging technology.
  163: ⟪ 282 characters skipped ⟫d just leave it at home or something with the neural link, you will not be able to do that and I think that's where you really need to have ethical guidelines will aren't where it's not just like Facebook or Gmail that reads all of your direct messages and personal documents and things like that, there will have to be some kind of a little bit more stringent.
  193: ⟪ 289 characters skipped ⟫ you in your own brain and it's kind of like if we should invite you that should be like a big flag or a milestone which like let's put the brakes on it now but we should also work backwards into Facebook into Gmail and things like that may I was mayor respond to apes today sure okay so soaps work is extremely extremely legit like what abe has done in terms of intracortical implants.
  268: To use a brain interface to control fingers and hands of another complete robot and hand-in-arm with like 25-27 degrees of freedom. So you guys have a really interesting conversation. I just want to remind you that there's a lot of books that don't have I guess some of the technical details that you guys are referencing.
  359: And you just it's a wearable EMG system and it was just acquired by Facebook for I think over 500 million dollars and it's basically able to decode like you can type without a keyboard and you you can even when you get good at it you can type without moving your fingers at all so it's basically a very high bandwidth interface and it's the guy who created it his vision was like, Doing neural interfaces and neural technology so like neuroscience type technology, but why stop at like medical treatment why why why do we put billions of dollars into like computer software and like iPhones and like VR but then and we have all this neural interface technology, but we only do it for like treating a disease like why do we stop there so his ideas let's take that technology and then go towards increasing the bandwidth between the human and the and the computer system and that's what they're that's what they're doing with a control labs in my opinion.
  443: So the reason why what I'm saying is true is because the the the the research that so I'm currently writing the book about all the research that has been done that it is that that is that we're going to use to apply to decoding thoughts with this technology genetics, yes, you're going to use opportunities to I guess to it and so point and I'm looking forward to it.
  488: Yeah like I don't see I don't like yeah, I don't yeah yeah very high accuracy right now as what I'm saying, they're at a very high accuracy right now and what we can do first and foremost is actually create bring some clarity to the difference between behavior barometric data in real time because that has to do with literally knowing your cognitive dynamics in real time and if we put if we just throw that data in with your pictures on Facebook, the advantage is the difference between a mosquito bite and Frenchman on your, Privacy and an elephant trampling on your cognitive and your cognition in real time.
  497: Facebook is doing the same thing and then they're analyzing for. You advertising type of profile and then they're selling it to advertisers like what so I think it's so important to get into when you start getting access to neural data what does that changing in the picture because you can't even talk about that if you don't understand you it's like man you bring in what the current picture actually is which I think most people are probably don't even understand the level and I don't know if it's like sensitive air territory here or something but like you people you know, when someone's watching you they they can like yeah, You can learn a lot about someone just by what pushes right looking at their habits and like more than you can fry them, okay?
  617: I can actually answer that with a real example, so there's this there there's neuroscience. Ific his name is David Eagleman, he was Texas based in Sanford he's San Francisco Bay area base now but he um, he wrote he's written a bunch of books. I recommend that you check out his books, um, and one of the things he talks about are basically alternative kinds of of neural interfaces that implant information into your brain, for example, there's been there have been tongue strips that have electrodes on the tongue and and they're connected to a camera and you give this to someone who's blind.
  746: I don't know what that possible limit could be but yeah it there ultimately has to be a bandwidth rate limit, but it's also possible that we will before we even get to that that we could figure out. Something more fundamental, which is some imagine if your brain is a network because there's a book called networking the brain it's a or wait, let me look that up but the book is let's see networking the brain.
  748: And maybe maybe I have taught no networks or the brain so networks of the brain oh by Olaf's born he's a neuroscientist so this book is really really cool but imagine the brain is like the internet imagine that you're you're you're not you're you're neural circuits in there in in your class, you're the clusters of neurons in different neural columns and micro columns are that they connect to each other across the entire brain.
  854: Okay I guess it's me So early income they created a microsurgery robot. It implants these microfibers with each one having like 16 electrodes. With such precision it does like really microscopic imaging, you know, it it's a it they're able to I have pictures on if you look at at the Facebook group self-aware networks or the Facebook group neurophysics these groups that I that I've been I'm running for 10 plus years and some instances.

   214: Or a TMS may actually be the wrong treatment for some depression for some patients with depression and those pay those patients would be experiencing depression because they're basically they're having a metabolic disorder where their cells are not able to produce enough energy enough ATP. And so like so for example like there's a book that book that I read that it was just a layman's book but it was about how people who have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome and depression, they they might be able to like basically there's like 20 different things they can try and one of those things was like the ribose because the ribos is if you take it like I think it was like five grams a day many patients saw like an improvement in their energy and in their happiness and reduction in their fibromyalgia and reduction in their chronic fatigue syndrome and in.
   328: Oh hi shunt. I was searching for following up with a glimpse added type on the on the Google I remember read that this article. I mean, it's basically my bookmark list that lives by this doctor at a Washington University's Franklin Falls in the so the title of the paper is the cleansing power of a deep nice sleep and a it just to address one of my popular like practical question that the the frequency of the waves this is.
   616: And so the things the surprising finding challenges current anatomy and historical textbook knowledge that lymphatic vessels are found in the central nervous system where they're not known to exist and so they're saying that you know, they were they were found connected to the eye and they're being used to you know, clear out basically to clean the brain but the lymphatic system.
   732: Yeah, I kind of tied those things together just knowing about it. So, yeah. Are you writing books and papers? I hope so because I keep this knowledge needs to be preserved and shared. So, I hope you're writing. Oh, I'll tell you I'll tell you. I'll tell you what to do.
  1056: Actually now I think about it. I do have a book that I haven't finished. I was actually that I had a graph about that. Oh as you sent me just left the room I just posted two studies to my profile which explained the importance of vitamin D receptors in the heart how it down regulates the arena and tense instances them and also if you knock out vitamin D receptors in the vascular endothelium, you get a drop in nitric oxide so I thought that would be useful to astronauts but I guess they'll have to get by.

  352: So but you may actually try to to have a look at his work. So, that's a, Personal and I think it's the case against reality. The case against reality is done half DON'T. So I have a different recommendation. I recommend a book called the Neural Basis of Free. Will by Peter Tse is the neural basis of free will criteria causation by Peter T S E Peter Ulrich T S E.

Yeah, I will also would love to go back to a Carl was talking about and also hyperspace the book was what kind of got me thinking about like another dimension being just impossible to see so that's also a book that I enjoyed that stemmed back to Carl's thought.
  761: And and so you've heard of PB and learning, you know, the there's the there's some neurons detected coincidence patterns neurons attacked when two neurons downstream fire, that is the detect detection of information that isn't a book called the neural basis of free will and so that's known. Unknown. So what is known there is that something can create a pattern that something can recreate.

I was gonna say I was gonna say so what one thought for for Nick was is that book, um rhythms of the I think it was rhythm, so the brain maybe that mighty bit not be the right total the title, but.
   183: I ended up like citing that in my grant that book in my a bunch of times because it's just explained so it's explained so well, Interesting yeah, let's take a look because yeah, my field of studies coined is rhythm generation, so. It's probably take a look at that.
   186: Bye. Take outside of the box of the persistent sodium burst themselves and the recurrent synaptic excitation. Yeah, that author has two books and I'm currently reading them both but I I I haven't I can't speak to the whole book but I think they're I think he's trying to cover the topic of it oscillations from micro to macro.
   192: N't really read through that. What does he start talking about in that book?
   821: There are a number of beautiful YouTube videos that try to illustrate this point but I found that I did not really understand the underlying mathematics before a friend of mine gave me a book and for the effort in the title, it's written by some physicists who would measure discovered this relationship to number 0.

   280: But think of it this way. Let's take you. Read a book like a fiction book. And it's a really good book it's engrossing. So you start getting absorbed into the therapy you start identifying with them you start to forget the world around you. In a sense you're generating a consciousness.
   298: Does that make sense? You mentioned yeah somewhat you mentioned something about if you're reading a book. It's like another consciousness is kind of injected or beside your brain, right? And that but I was wondering like isn't what happens in that mute consciousness like that story that's happening in your brain just the product of visit goal atoms and, Particles that are composing the brain and that conscious new conscious thing is like an emergent kind of quality that's just based on the atoms in the brain like it's not something that exists outside the universe, right?

   145: You know, physical a physical substrate and effective so can I yeah that would yeah sure go ahead so I want to respond to this so I read a book that that addressed this this exact thing that this brought up but but I just want to point out that that's sort of like what's implied in what you're saying is that consciousness is a non-physical activity and and I can't possibly agree with that so if I so okay, so the book was called, That.
  1296: The there's many different properties there's it's it your brain is is associating you know, like like how it feels how it looks the orientation of the phone there's a great work by Jeff Hawkings who wrote he wrote this new book it's called um a thousand brains by Jeff Hockings and he talks about how a neuro column is going to you bring has a lot of neural columns and and you might have just one neuro column that's going to model each of the objects in your experience right now and you know in terms of like, you know, the stuff that you're seeing.
  1727: Mechanism like certain triggers that will activate this because their body does not know how to write it's like flight right and freeze and there's like in a freeze responsive and go out of body experience comes out of it and so I personally there's this I just finished reading this really good book it's called the body keeps the score and it's by a doctor yeah yeah and then there's like this one section this is like a lot of psychiatric disorders come about because it's a form of self-protective mechanism, so PTSD is like one of them because you have the triggers get.
  1954: Chicken to you know how if you go outside you know like the branches and branches of a tree are kind of like not very silly and stimuli well if you think about it faces actually do look really similar. I mean, if you look at the you know, the yearbook and you turn it upside down, you might actually have a hard time identifying people and you you would confuse people so I think it's actually pretty surprising that we're able to differentiate faces as much as they are.

   281: Okay so so the so so what so there was um, so Peter Tse he suggested that the the amount of the NDMA receptors. I forget exactly was many years ago. I read his book anyway NDMA receptors could be regulated by the neuron or by by neurons regulating on the other neurons, so to change basically to change the okay so so part of this was this idea that the output of the neuron would have would have a be able to change its volume like it could it?
   435: so I'm I mean that that is kind of the idea of Peter Tse's book the neural basis of of free well
   561: and back propagating action potentials and I think Rafael used probably has some good explanations of it in his book called Spines.
   568: no no, you know you didn't um, that was really great that was um, so it was interesting okay so so Jeff Hawkins was in his book on the new book a thousand brains he was saying that he thinks the the dendritic spike could be how the neuron is predicting that it's going to fire and in addition to everything else he said did you agree with that?
   623: It's it has like a picture of a wizard hat. And he basically so so the bit the Silicon Valley is just full of like CS people right So so and then Elon Musk like putting up this like neuroscience thing in the center of all these tech people who don't know what the fuck it's even for so so basically Tim Urban wrote this amazing article, it's huge it's like that it's the same size as like reading a chapter in a book.
   629: You know anyways, I think this is his I might this might be from my intro textbook or it might be from his article. I can't remember but you can sort of think of so yeah the dendrites are leaky they're like if you took the hose and you stabbed it a bunch of times of the fork and you're trying to shove water on one side, it's gonna like lose a bunch of water by the time I get to see other side, but you can also like duct tape.
   950: A-frame doesn't run natively at the same speed doesn't run at native speed if you run it if you run it in an app.  unfortunately so um so I'm excited about react three fiber for that reason and also because of the fact that the the pool of react developers as much as is much more massive than in the pool of of aframe or 3js developers and so that means potentially, you know, I think that all the Facebook and and and Twitter and Netflix all those big companies will they'll create the AR and VR versions of their websites will be the exact same website they have now but they'll be 3d and you'll see them in an AR on your phone or AR with your glasses etc, but then we build with racks react three fiber in and I think those companies don't really, Like this yet but I I can I can see this trend happening because the because the masses of react developers at Facebook will will realize that they have really the best tool they have for creating VR is is with r3f or reacts three fiber but so react should be something that I look into more than like it other things.
  1026: It just dominates and and that so the idea that he was talking about his book a thousand brains is that that we can have entire objects like whole complete objects in just a level one of the cortex and then um, I started thinking about you know, well, you know people um, sometimes say the eyes really part of the brain because there's so there's so many different layers to
  1107: on predictive coding yeah in visual cortex and my advisor had me read on intelligence which I think I read like chapters five or six or whatever the chapters were actually describing the structure of feedback connections and predictive coding some familiar with that what's new to me right now, are you talking about is like I mean, I guess yeah, what what what is new beyond that the on intelligence book?

  103: So I'm excited about that because I've been interested in L form bacteria for a long time. There's a there's a researcher who who's no longer alive now. She did it. Her work over decades and she wrote a book called stealth. Pathogens her name's. Her name's Lida Mattman and there's been a lot of work on it, but just not enough work, though, you know, been a lot of work, but, you know, just not enough focus on it because they're hard to culture.
  130: I've also read a book by Dale Bredison. I don't know if you've heard of him I mean pull up his Dale. How do you spell his last last name? Bradison breadison b, r e, d e, s e n. Okay, he was a long time, researcher and Alzheimer's in the laboratory.
  165: Sort of like fire in the right sequence. Timing sequence again, and that restore some functionality to the patient that they that they lost at least temporarily in. And so I'm sort of like really interested in and and gently work, you know, he wrote the book, the secret language of cells because he sort of like says, well let's move the focus on biology to basically the communication between neurons and and not answer the communication between cells not neurons.

  214: Or if you don't want to read his book, he's actually on a lot of interviews and podcasts and stuff. You can hear a kind of summary view of it, because he talks about, you know, blood sugar. Insulin is a big factor, he talks about several different types. He calls them types of Alzheimer's, based on their data.
  220: A s c o and okay Lewis Carrasco. Okay, we see. Yeah, you IS. I've actually corresponded with him and and he he's got actually a couple of books that he wrote after even retired that are available on that are fairly easy breeds because they're meant more for non-specialists. Oh, do you have maybe one of the names of the books or so I can make sure I got the right guy and, you know, I might still have it in my bio.
  259: Because I discovered a lot of things, and I think I may be able to help a lot of people. Do you want to talk about some of the things that you you've discovered because I'm I'm totally curious. Okay. Well, there is this book. I learned about a long time ago called the Pulse test by Dr.
  265: And so he ended up doing research, he wrote, he wrote books, he wrote articles, but I learned about a book that he wrote in the 1950s late in his career when he found out that the scientific establishment wasn't going for it, you know, even though other people verified what he found.
  268: But anyway, he wrote a book called the Pulse test that my mom brought home from a library. She worked to the library. Anyway, later on, I mean I found that his test didn't work that well for me because I just reacted to everything. And and so it didn't get very far but eventually I found out about another version of it that you can do that was a shortcut test so he had you test your heart rate 14 times a day and that really wasn't very helpful when you reacted to everything.
  295: You know. Very cool. You know I'll tell you the other thing that that between you know, if you look at Dr, Coco's book. How many different symptoms were helped? You'll be astonished. And I'm sure his reliable, because I've confirmed it plus, you know, he was confirmed by other people, too.

   13:    42: The idea that led me to coin the term cellular oscillating tomography came from several places, part of the idea came from the book about Cells by Jon Lieff M.D. He dives into a lot of the surprisingly intelligent things that cells do, and makes it clear that cellular communication is the central topic of biology. One was a book about neural coding called Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay, in that book Lindsay talks about the history of trying to apply Information Theory to the study of neurons. There is a long history of attempts there. I also knew from studying the work of Ilya Prigogine, 10-15 years prior to reading these books, that cells were oscillating dissipative structures. So if you realize that cellular communication or signals between cells that activate different cell functions is the core topic in the study of biology, and you know that neurons communicate via receptors or synapses, and you know that there is a long history to trying to apply information theory to neurons then you can piece together how I arrived at the phrase Cellular Oscillating Tomography, oh the application of the word Tomography comes from the study of variously tomography related concepts, such as the Fourier Slice Transform, Holography, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electrical Impedance Tomography, and even understanding the concept of coincidence detection as the basic function of a neuron after reading "The Neural Basis of Freewill by Peter Tse"
   67:    67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.

   30: I got his picture. This time is gonna grab this real quick and show you this. This book is the neural basis of free will by Peter's sea criterial, causations of subtitle. And that book is really great because it served like and we also got the on intelligence book here.
   32: He lost me and also got, this is on a telegraph and let's see. We also we also got networks of the brain by oral offspring, say that right there. So what I was going to say was so going to Jeff Hawkins book real quick but then we'll go back to Peter says but so Jeff Hockings book and you've read his book, he talks about how grids of cells are complex enough to to measure a.
   42: So that'll give his passed on to about the parts of the brain around being tested use that ethnic explain the novelty. This is world people that we have, right? So so Hawkins book, really drives how our brands might formulate models with the world based on sensory inputs. But then what was really great about periods.
   44: Seasbook or Peter says book, the nobel basis of free will criteria. Causation is he then says, well, they in the brain says, well, maybe every neuron is a coincidence attack really quint and the maybe the basis of a bit of information. The brain is a coincidence. And and with that means is that if you have a higher key of cells like this, this is rightly believe.
   58: Oh, this is a sense of itself. Right week under this our operating abstract a sense of self-sup. Yeah. So and I I think that you know if you look at like so look at it I was gonna get the book for Douglas hostage, Douglas top seller says that the self is a strange loop of.
  118: And what travels between is, is our chemical activations. That can trick ourselves further down the line. But what you don't see in all these textbooks neuroscience is the really complex mappings between all the neurons. So, this is like this, right here, represents this right here and this is the dendress, the generic could activate something.
  176: This is in the nearly podcast number five, I talked to Android Jones. They we got this headset from use and let me pull this music down. Okay, around that, what did I do with my name? Sorry. So we got this headset from us. Okay? And the news headband and it integrates into the Facebook.
  178: You can see that integrates into Facebook, some not know any screens into the divide headset. Here's another. This one is another easy four or five headset. And so anyway, we're looking, we're looking at the right now, working with me as we're looking to get about. But the point is that your brain waves can dry a changes to light and sound effects and microdose, VR, and that enable you to become aware of how your thousand feelings are brands and how those brainweights are causing change.

  54: And any neuroscience or competition neuroscience textbook is these charges or separated through the activity. And then what happens is they separate enough, they caught it because the cell there's so has to people rise. This separation, pay positive thing, or charge the same principle, might positive negative charges separate and the sky.
  56: And obviously, inviting both in the brain, have an action potential. But unlike the sky that there is a, there's a patent least resistance. That's that is the the axon body itself, the middle of the cell body and that doesn't. And unlike you know standard neuroscience textbook, it doesn't the action potential doesn't travel direct between two neurons.
  80: And that feedback could be at the screen step, each part of each part of, it can be industries to screen step where the dendrite itself could be like. So imagine you have a bunch of dendrites that are competing like on 10,000 or a hundred thousand danger that impeding for the signal that's coming from the era that's in all the textbooks, right?

Basically, they're not going to sell the cameras directly but it's a hardware spec that allows you to have, you know, either an X24 or 24 cameras or six cameras.

nlp4:
  16: Yeah, I agree. So be really fascinating to talk about maybe how that plays a role in the future of the human experience. And also how we're going to build machines, that capture various aspects of human and scholarships got industry. Got me on this training with was a book called on intelligence by Jeff Hawkins or Hawkins and he's he was never a scientist, he said of writing this to, and he was also the made all kinds of different qualifies handspring device then eventually.
  24: So this is not I because that's what the neuron network represents with its weights problems. So so basically he was describing his book on intelligence. He was subscribing, the corner which was sort of like this. So the neural networks and existed, since since the 80s, a lot of, a lot of great designs for computers came from the 80s.

nlp5:
   22: Having sort of multiple raised shot into your eyes at once and and so this was just a test since then, I mean, if you look at the more recent work that he does a company be partnered with that Facebook and they built a that is 24 lenses, you know, they don't call it a light film thing but to me it's it's it captures, this similar, way, overlapping viewpoints that we can then use to reconstruct a scene and given that it captures that in motion and that you can move the camera around or it multiple cameras and can build, you know, a holographic asset and that's exactly the pipeline.
   30: And it got did they get a lot of people decided? Because I think it opened their eyes to the fact that there's more than just 360 or even 360 with depth. I mean, there's a full haul, graphic universe waiting to be captured, and every time you're not doing that, you know, it's like not capture things in color, you're missing a whole dimension of experience, and I'm grateful that Facebook's attacking the problem.
   32: I think there's others in this, you know, this basement. Cool stuff like row and also do the Facebook sort of set the bar for a lot of others to sort of follow them into, like, the minimum, you need not to have a compelling experience. You've seen the demos that we've done with the data is that, you know, like and getting overlapping death is really, really great.
   36: So it's massive fire updated, which I think you. We're talking Beginning like how do we get this down to you know compress it to something. That's typical we have and now I've seen as I've been a CS and I tried type VR, you got to try the Sony has their own sort of 60 degree, freedom in your your project Facebook and you know six degrees of freedom freedom in it in a camera.
   38: So this is now going down the pipeline or Facebook and Sony are saying, okay, we're gonna take this this technology of volume of should we call volumetric video or find term for the for what we're doing this point, just go 0.5. It's got me multiple layers. We have even more razor than it's a light field.
   44: And if the camera's moving won't work, so that means it's basically capturing the still scene and you know, that's that is still super relative absolutely important first to have it even in a camera. I think it's an amazing piece of software. I do think though that one of the things that Facebook guys did right was that, you know, I want to be able to capture video.
   50: And I think that this probably some fits somewhere price wise, maybe between the lights were stuff in the Facebook stuff. And I think Sony stuff as far as I don't know how they captured. I think it was done in a very clever way to make it work. Well, so Sunday capture it with three irregular 3D 360 rig and, and so there's, but they're selling it not regular consumers, but to like the producers of shows plays and concerts because it requires a lot of post production.
   52: Yeah. On the Facebook, does it mean what you're seeing out of the demos there is largely the raw data. I mean, I don't know if you mean post correction like, this means cleaned up or had like that reflections and different effects. I mean, you have to do that with the Facebook stuff, too.
   54: But not quite so much because one thing I can't speak to the Sony data set. I've never used it, but the Facebook one, I've I'm now I, you know, months into this thing and I spent so many hours looking at it and working on the on the different parts of it.
   62: Like I wanted the results to be really good and I will say the Facebook stuff is really good. So it doesn't mean that others can't even do higher quality. Some questions, is it possible? How much work is it? I don't know. You know, the Facebook stuff is largely automated kind of compelling to see that come out of the process of time without any human intervention.
   66: How can we make them behave like objects in a program? How can programmers use them to make any demo we did in unity with the Facebook video data? Well anyway, if you haven't you should check out the video that we did at a. And in that video we actually showed exactly that we're flow.
   70: So, by the way, render that into a beautiful, I feel that publish experience for perfectly on six and six degrees of freedom and for real-time interaction, you know, you can actually treat the Facebook video data as a game level, which is exactly what we're showing in our booth. And I got better flies flopping around the office, touch control to giant light.
   72: I can drop it on the ground and, you know, like things up. You've got an inclusion, you've got GI all these tools that we're building. So, it's a game level. And in fact, you most the most awesome thing I do with the Facebook camera is you can use it to just scan environment and you know, take a few seconds of that and drop it in unity and you've got a fully formed game level.
   76: Hopefully the Facebook, checks it out or booth or these trade shows that we go to. It's pretty cool. So going back to here. Yeah, you had this announcement with OTG that idea was, you know, we can, we can game of VR experience to a headset. So you can stream something from that's processed with powerful desktop GPUs over Wi-Fi or over 520 results.
  122: Those teams are not really thinking about that yet. They focus on stop and friend of mine, who's a group on rails. Guy said, you know, you need to do the UDP. So I said, because I do all this, you know, 12 years of neuroscience, study and I have these great great groups like software networks on Facebook very popular.
  124: And so I'm reading every this book networks within the mind and I'm listening to this, oh, you need beauty instead of PCP, and I'm like, think about this stuff. And I said, so if the brain is like a network, what would the communication portable? Would it be more like TCP where you need to establish like a connection will be more like EDP.

I applied Buzsáki's work to Steven Strogatz (in the book Sync) work to connect Oscillations brainwaves at EEG scale to phase variation produced oscillations at the neuronal scale & neurotransmitter scale, and unified neural firing with brainwave firing via the hypothesis that magnitude is inverted to frequency at all scales of the universe, including at the scale of individual neuron action potential firing & at the scale of brainwaves from cortical columns or oscillating groups of cells. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0079z.md
   79: # The Book Notes
   81: These are the book notes for the book Self Aware Networks: The Neurophysics of Consciousness, Artificial Neurology, and Brain Machine Interfaces
   84: These notes are not ready for anyone to read them as they still need lots of editing & fixing. The book includes a new gravity equation hypothesis, a new model of a neuron, a new explanation for LTD & LTP, a new explanation for internal representations or qualia, a new explanation for how our bodies & brains are conscious, and much more.
   92: You are in the selfawarenetworks repo which is for the book notes, there is another repo that has pictures & book quotes called picturesforbook
   94: This page is the home page of www.selfawareneuralnetworks.com and this repo contains the notes for the book Self Aware Networks, and it represents the notes that are being used to make the book. Critically you should know that these notes are not the book (not yet anyways).
  100: (still editing & fixing these auto audio transcripts. Fixing these transcripts is a bit more work per hour per day than I realized, ah hmm... and I think I all the notes still need editing at this point. Some more than others. The transcripts might take two months, but the way I am beginning to make connections between documents is threading the book together so this process seems like the right one.)
  102: # Personal sounding journal stuff in the book notes is not necessarily true, accurate, or relevant, and will be mostly cleaned up & removed going forward.
  103: If you see something that looks like it belongs in a personal diary, realize two things 1. It doesn't mean it's true, in my view the human brain procedurally generates sentences, memories, fictions from fired synapses. As everyone knows human memory is not always reliable. 2. I will be pruning or removing content that is off topic for the book & the institute and that includes most of the stuff that might sound personal. Some of it might be used in the author bio section but that should be a short section at the back of the book.
  106: *Note for the publication of the notes on June 17th 2022 Keep in mind these are raw notes, everything needs to be updated, organized, edited, cleaned up, before it goes into the book. What you see are sketches, drafts, early versions of many ideas that will be cleaned up & improved. This is a super early preview of what is to come. Like software that is pre-beta (alpha) release. THE POINT is to give you an early preview of what I am working on, the monumental amount of work that I am putting into the book, so you can get an idea of what I am creating, and if you want, now you can help. Over the next 5 months the book will emerge from these notes.
  110: That's part of why I've given myself 5 more months to complete this book. In theory it should take a lot less time than that to turn these notes into a book.
  112: # Pre-ordering the Book, Pricing, Future Editions
  113: You can pre-order or purchase the book here, if you pre-order you will help support me in creating this book: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3QHX9FN?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420&fbclid=IwAR0j14R_e2Lr_liTlrBitmff-j8YiWq26YH-XRb8U94jD6n_S_T6Rmn-FqY
  115: Someone asked me how much my book will cost. Well the 1rst edition of the book will be mostly text, and the price will be $9.99. The 2nd Edition of the book will be greatly expanded & clarified with, with new research, new content, and beautiful 2D & 3D art & illustrations & will fetch a higher price (I haven't decided on a price yet for the 2nd Edition, but it might be comparable to the book Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind (Fifth Edition) 5th Edition, Kindle Edition by Michael Gazzaniga (Author), Richard B. Ivry (Author), George R. Mangun (Author) in price which sells for $95. Both the first & second editions will be collectors items.
  117: Please pre-order the book to support my work, especially if you enjoy these notes or find any value from reading them. The book price of $9.99 is thanks & support for this work. I would appreciate it if you pre-ordered the book after reviewing these book notes, especially if you found my work valuable or interesting.
  119: # Some, but not all of these notes are intended to become part of a book titled "Self Aware Networks by Micah Samuel Blumberg"
  123: Not every statement in the notes was written by me, some of the notes include quotes from others, some include text & ideas written by others, some of the notes include transcribed conversations with others that Micah Blumberg had with other people, in the final book it is the intention to quote every source accurately and to give all credit to the sources of various ideas that are due to those sources.
  127: Some of it is incorrect, some of it is untrue, but if I included untrue and incorrect information in my notes that is because the information that I saved in my notes had something of value in it that I wished to extract or later examine for extraction so that I could include something from it into the book.
  135: This is the homepage of the Self Aware Networks Institute that you can contribute to from your github account by making a pull request. The contents of this Institute are the source material for the book called "Self Aware Networks" that I haven't released yet. The web address is selfawarenetworks.com and there are a number of associated groups that I will link here shortly. 
  147: Please note that audio notes were auto transcribed with neural networks via Google Recorder, and then I put them into Google Docs to run an automatic grammar check. So what you are reading is NOT exactly what was originally said. That is why I am sharing it in my notes but I will not share this in this form in my book.
  149: c0000x was invented to designate notes that correspond to sections of the book outlined in the table of contents.
  157: I hope that the most intelligent people in the world read & enjoy my notes on human phenomenological consciousness, memory, gravity, cells & sentient machines, but I am going to tell you upfront that it's not all correct, some of the notes will not be included in the eventual book, but it's enough to get the main ideas across about the brain, the mind, and reality.
  159: Some of the ideas in these notes for the book are incorrect, outdated, and kept simply because they contained something interesting that I wanted to follow up on later. Some of the ideas are very well backed with sources. Some of the ideas I believe are correct are so different I will likely have to debate them. OK.
  162: you can submit pull requests from your account and if accepted you will be a documented contributor to this research. I may even cite your work in the upcoming printed version of the book titled Self Aware Networks.
  164: Potentially anyone can contribute to the development of the book, to the development of software, and to the institute. Producing actual software, for drones, for brain computer interfaces, for humanoid robots, for mechanical animals, all of these things are part of the plan. Thanks for insisting on tangible results! Will do! Would be glad to have other folks help if you want to.
  170: ⟪ 574 characters skipped ⟫ reorganizes the existing content in a mind blowingly insightful way, or create mind maps, artwork, spreadsheets, diagrams, and cite mountains of research for or against any of the proposals in these book notes and such contributions might be considered worthy of inclusion.
  174: Another disclaimer. Not all of the notes are intended to be serious. Some include cultural references to science fiction films, science fiction books, or other popular media content, and none of these cultural references to popular media content are intended for the book, but at some point we can have a dedicated repo to cultural references related to brain computer interfaces, intelligent robots, science fiction, and other content that might be interesting to people who like these topics.
  183: The table of contents + the map of notes are supposed to help organize the content in the notes into the final book due out November 17th 2022.
  185: I would love it if enthusiastic people wanted to donate their time to helping to organize the content of the book, finishing the map of the notes, helping me to improve the table of contents, and working with me in dialog to flesh out certain ideas that might be unclear, and helping me fix mistakes in my notes.
  194: Some of the notes are poetic, or intended to inspire the artwork for the 2nd edition of the book. Some of the notes contain references to mythological ideas or religious ideas and those might inspire art, but it's not meant to be taken seriously. My intention is to not include any mythological or religious ideas in the text of the book. I don't endorse any particular religion. I think people can and will make up their own minds about what they want to believe in the context of religion & mythology, and I wouldn't want to be the person who was trying to tell others that they should believe some brand of religion or some specific set of mystical, spiritual, or mythological ideas. I think that sounds kinda fascist, trying to tell people what they have to believe, my opinion, so I won't do it.
  202: To figure out how I am going to organize these notes search for the phrase "book contents" "table of contents" and the word "map"
  204: # These notes go all the way back to 2011 and even before. They represent the work of a lifetime for me, but in the bigger picture these notes build on the work of great neuroscientists, great physicists, great mathematicians, great biologists, and great computer scientists, including the folks that invented deep learning and before that neural networks. I will expand the readme to include all the great books & papers I've read & considered.
  242: I made this video as a sort of disclaimer about my notes https://youtu.be/zxsrHZeNgKQ I wanted to prepare people to realize that these notes are not the book and they need a lot of work but some of the content in these published notes is intended to be the meat and bones of the finished book.
