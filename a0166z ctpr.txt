Well it took me a long long time to eventually read this in detail. Thanks for the very long messages I do like to read your thoughts.
I think 'you' is a directional concept, a direction that is always moving but somehow always points at you, where is you? do you have a centerpointe? is there any real you inside you or just a direction? How can you ever be separate from your brain and what your brain does?
Asking about whether the brain makes a decision before you do is a metaphysical disaster, it's an absurdity of terms, how does a brain become separate from you it doesn't even hold up to scrutiny, yet what number of persons will actually scrutinize this quandary?
The idea of freewill for the individual isn't about what the individual is doing this millisecond, it's about how the individual brain will interpret information by it's own criteria and adjust it's movements correspondingly. 
Every few milliseconds billions of pre-synaptic neurotransmitters are flooding across a gap into a post synapse adjusting the firing criteria for the post-synaptic dendrite. This is the mechanics of criteria causation or information based change. The information that makes up thought is causing biological movement, voice movement, finger typing movement, and even further thought movement.
There is a cycling vortex, and attractor of brainwave activity that is flowing, swooshing, oscillating with symphonic vibrancy to synchronize new hebbian learning patterns into the ongoing synergy of neural activity that is the canvas of sensory space and the magical direction called you.
