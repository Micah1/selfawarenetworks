(dendrite, synap) brain activity
Micah Blumberg I don't think you are you now Richard, what makes you think that you are more than a mechanical simulation of a person even now?

Micah Blumberg http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/hopkins201208141 who says you are you? there are memories, and connections in your mind, thats a short summary of it, none of this brain system is really you anyways.

Micah Blumberg your brains activity is a reaction, the connections and memories become the predictions of new causes, and the structure that influencies the development of new concepts, it barely works but it effectively simulates a functional person, with massive redundancy, and efficiency, technology by nature that is slightly more advanced than anything humans have built yet. but there isn't any real you, unless you are concepts consisting of connections between cellular memories, I don't think I'm that, I don't think I actually exist at all. Whats your spin on it?

Micah Blumberg what isn't artificial about intelligence now, the brain is a machine now, I don't exist in that, I'm not in my brain. I'm not a memory, or a branching network of connections between memories, but perhaps consciousness is nothing else except a result of that system of chemicals, and electricity and folded dna protein based brains? perhaps its a product, like a computer, and one day brains will be sold in a 99 cent store, little computer brains that have real consciousness, in a machine, Real not artificial consciousness.

Micah Blumberg you have a bunch of parts working together creating the illusion of a whole, identity is that illusion http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-thomas/schizophrenic-brains_b_1762933.html

Richard Pomfret That's a bit reductionist Micah, as 'me' I am more then just the sum of my neuron connections or connectome - I would at least add a few of my key organs and my entire nervous system into the mix. I 'feel', therefore I am. ;)

Micah Blumberg You can add the whole ecosystem that your apart of to the list. How can you live without air, without food, you have a certain amount of learned dependency on your social contract, not that it can't be unlearned, it would be more difficult to survive if you were the last person on earth, let alone reproduce, so lets just say the sum of you is more than your body. Why not add the entire cosmos, your not separate from spacetime, your made of the same stuff that's made in stars, particles, atoms, you are spacetime, you are the conscious peak of the cosmos, the galaxy is your robe, the sun is the cool chain you wear on your cosmic neck.

Micah Blumberg You can say that your everything, and because everything is an all inclusive term, you'd be right.

Micah Blumberg But if you stab a rock, it's not the same feeling as when you prick your finger. So in a sense your finger is more you than a rock. Yet you could lose a limb, and get an artificial replacement, and your plastic brain, with the right neuro-plastic treatment, can remap itself, to treat the artificial limb as if it were it's real limb. The brain is not completely dependent on the body, you could conceivably create an artificial body, the perfect artificial ecosystem for the brain, and the brain would adapt to, to control it, to become that new body, your new mechanical self. The components of the brain itself, the cells, the proteins, the particulars, the myelinated axons, the glial cell waste removal system, the microtubules, the camkii2, the branches of dendrites and synapses, serve as hardware for memory and concept formation, predictions of causes, derived from sequences of patterns, from chains of data, that comes in from the senses, and the brain itself, in any particular part, is just a system of cells, a cooperation of rivals, working together to feed, it's a hungry glucose and nutrient driven system, the hungriest organ in the body, but the result, is the coordination of a body, including your fingers, and your voice muscles, for communication, the same way your brain relates to itself, it relates to everyone else.

Micah Blumberg So if a rock isn't really me, and if I can lose a finger the finger isn't really me, and I can take any particular cell in my brain out, because my braincells are not really me, then what I am is some emergent property, a macroscopic form that doesn't exist in the detail, a higher level idea, a ghost, and a ghost that doesn't really exist at the microscopic level. My existence is in heaven, in a cloud, in a dream, and it's so not real :)
