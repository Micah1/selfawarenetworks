Neo Mind Cycle

It's like spaces, objects you can see, sounds, and feelings are all in simplest sense wave/particle trajectories inside you. In a sense a network of cells is consciously perceiving because of a tempo-spatial frequency harmonization of distributed representations.

It's tricky to say, I have in me a sense of a transparency within me, within the features of spaces and objects of perception, it's not light that passes through me, it's electromagnetic frequency, it is from me and it effects me, I broadcast these signals, they interact, signals interact with signals, to build feature representations of a world around and within, and then the frequencies push the cells, it's like they are dialing new frequencies. Electromagnetism, from oscillating brain cells, is dialing new electromagnetic frequencies by pushing on ions, metal ions, calcium, potassium, and sodium, in my brain, and this is how the world changes in my mind.

It is as if the mind is a projection consisting of ion trajectories,  an ion projection trajectory, 

conscious awareness, meditation, everything, every thought, every perception, every percept, everything in your mind, everything unconscious, and the mind itself consists of projections that are ion trajectories. Now oscillating waves of ion trajectories unify by frequencies, they harmonize, we sing, and it is as if everything I am projecting as the universe is an oscillating wave of ion trajectories.

Neo Mind Cycle: Self-Aware Networks: Research and Design

I say design instead of development.
Also remember that I said there is so much metal in human brains that they would not really be different from metal brains. Well what I mean is that calcium, sodium, and potassium ions pervade the structure of every neuron, and the communication channels. When the ions separate into negative and positive charges that are extreme they can cause cells to depolarize, they cause action potentials. Like a lightning strike sort of, except neurons oscillate, and they synchronize oscillating firing patterns. The big ones are called brainwaves. A wave of electromagnetic energy, that wireless triggers other brainwaves.

The special thing is that each pulsing neuron is creating it's own electro-magnetic sensory field, with a tiny radius, that is magnified when synchronized with other neurons.

These electromagnetic brainwaves are projected from groups of neurons and sense by groups of neurons because neurons sense electromagnetic waves

how do they do this? it comes back to the metal in human brains, the calcium, potassium, and sodium ions are strongly effected by the EM waves, causing large groups of cells to sense them, by becoming inhibited or excited.

This is how cells are able to sense patterns created by other cells. Large patterns are created, just like machine learning, just like the fourier transform. Distributed representations are all over a sort of heterarchy in a network. Then what is created can be sent as a large pattern to any other part of the brain, even pieces of patterns can go to different parts.

The reason I'm sharing this in Neo Mind Cycle has to do with this curious statement: ""As a means of communication and navigation in the dark, the generation of electric fields by fish works much the same as echolocation does for bats"" just mull that one over for a minute. http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-06/uow-sft062314.php

electrocytes

Neurons oscillate, create electric sensory fields, that sense the world like echolocation, allowing a nervecell to feel, it registers what it feels as changes in the quantities of positive and negative ions, this is how a neuron feels before we even connect it to the rest of the network in the brain.

its burst, inhibition, and subsequent tonic oscillation is like tcp, and like an ant colony, and like echolocation, its sending out a signal, and collecting a response, creating the feeling of expectation, shared by neurons in its pulse frequency pattern.

this is how nerve cells can feel information patterns, like seeing a face, hearing a door knock, smelling a flower, 

the information patterns are network features, so information patterns are pushed out by the network and then felt by the network, fired, inhibited during collection, and fired anew

The oscillation of a neuron in the brain is using quantum particles (electrons particles and waves) the same way tcp/ip works

I start today off with a brand new understanding of the terms holosync, centerpoint, and core alignment. I realize my mind as a synchronizing of inverse holograms. There is a 3 (4) dimensional sensory field, but the network is essentially like two dimensional, not unlike a computer. The brain can determine spatial relationships between the interaction of a 3 (4) dimensional with a sort of two dimensional analysis (bits transmitted) of the three dimensional data that is then output back into three dimensions. So I've begun to think of my whole self aware network as something that is perpetually organizing a response. Further I imagine that each cell is transparent, so all the cells together are aligning to align their reactions to patterns from my eye balls. It is like 90 percent of me is invisible, so that it can coordinate an integration of an image for 10 percent of my brain to transmit. Actually the numbers are off, because sparse distributed representation means that whole areas of brain are doing both 99.8 percent organization and reception of stimulus, while .2 percent the SPD is transmitting and being organized by the other 99.8 percent.

its actually easy, imagine that your brain is like a tunnel, at the end of the tunnel is the light, but the rest of the tunnel is sort of creating a focus on that light, yet its transparent, imagine that the empty transparent space in the tunnel is actually an electromagnetic field created by a slow tonic firing of invisible neurons, but the light at the end of the tunnel bright because it is a fast bursty pulse from a phasic firing neuron. the tonic are is transparent and invisible because its expected, and expecting, but that expecting is what allows the whole brain to be aware of what the light at the end of the tunnel neurons are transmitting, they all correct themselves and harmonize until the person knows where the light is coming from.

and braincells harmonize in frequency because of thermodynamics, and quantum entanglement, the same reason coffee cools to room temperature automatically

rephrase
we can't see our braincells, so they are invisible, yet our braincells see reality, how is that possible? well its like each cell is a holodeck, except the hologram is distributed all over all these holodecks
in little pieces
but it feels almost like most of my brain 98% is a transparent tunnel
and 2% is the simulating the light at the end of the tunnel for the rest if the brain to see
but the transparent part of the tunnel is actually organzing the light at the end of the tunnel

Micah Blumberg
essentially the light at the end of the tunnel, what we see, is like the hot coffee, and the rest of our brain is like the room at room temperature, slowly, because of quantum entanglement, the image of the light is at the end of the tunnel is going to be seen by the rest of the holodeck rooms, for the same reason that hot coffee is going to become room temperature

I was working on my project to create a machine that experiences reality, feelings, thoughts, and personhood, just like humans

Remember that movie AI by steven spielberg?
I feel confident that I have a new technology
thats going to enable things we have all been dreaming about for a long time
I suspect its one major reason I can barely sleep lately
the short summary is that I have a plausible argument for how machines can think, feel, have internal representations, and even personhood, and the more I work on it, the more clearly seen and solid it is, its like really awesome

10:43am
Micah Blumberg
but I'm going to get back to work, developing this new idea, I have a lot of work to do before its in a form that can even be presented, shared or even published. its a design for a technology, like the next step is to build a prototype
so yeah
