(cerebral cortex, neuron)
ok so when you have an experience a bunch of nerve cells fire in a group, if you have that experience several times that same group of cells will fire together several times, this creates an association
(June 15th 2012)
, because neurons that fire together wire together, next up you have a slightly different experience that is someone similar to the previously mentioned experience, so one of the cells from the previously mentioned group of cells fires with a new group of cells, but the cells that didn't fire, because they significantly associated with one of the cells that did fire, well those cells go into a "ready" state because they are now expecting to fire. That expectation is a the basis of memory-prediction, it's how our mind maps reality, through sequences of expectations, that link cells together based on previous experiences. Memory-prediction is how information is coded in neural activity. That's what thinking is, a prediction, the whole cerebral cortex can be said to be a modeling system, of the world we predict is real, and all the models of the world we perceive with our mind through our senses are really made up of countless predictions, encoded in neural activity.

Almost all the time you are "having" (not necessarily the right word) life experiences that are similar to thousands of other previous life experiences in a multitude of ways, so all the sensory input you get all day is creating associations with all kinds of previous life experiences, cells in the front layer of curves and lines in the visual cortex may for example trigger a past experience of the letter a, which readies a bunch of networks from apple, to andy, if you also see the color red in another front layer of cortex, now the cells that correlate with the letter a and the color red are ready and firing as you think about them, then you read the number five, because the lines and curves in a front layer are associated with another layer of cells that have been strongly associated from particular past experiences, like the learned word alpha 5 on a red back ground, so the bits of data that came in, followed the path of expecting neurons, based on previously linked association, to unite with a previous learned group of associations that represent "alpha 5 on a red back ground" and then the brain notices that the red background is more orange-red, so while the cells that associated when you learned alpha 5 on a red background have now fired, and inhibit nearby patterns there is now an association reaching out to another group that is the learned representation of orange-red. Each learned representation is literally a map constructed our of sensory input via space and time, represented in a three dimensional x,y,z axis in the cerebral cortex. If that exact position of the cortex was damaged via stroke, tumor, or other injury, it's possible that that map of spacial/temporal associations will be remade by another portion of the brain, provided your interested and committed to learning the alpha 5 on red or red-orange background association again. Your previous associations, in terms of mapped life experiences, are the basis of your expectations in life, that's the metric by which you judge your experiences. Who is experiencing your life? Well your previous experiences are. That's the narrative of you, the song of soul, the symphony of I am. New experiences can have a tipping point where the internal maps of associations that represent you under go a fundamental shift, the pattern that is you becomes more capable of interpreting life experiences in a useful way. Passing the tipping point, into a new internal narrative, is a threshold experience, many times means your going to be capable of handling bigger problems then you were before, or it means you will be able to handle the same problems with greater ease. It's your brain improving it's own maps, out of necessity, experience, so that your brain is able to represent alpha 5 on a red/orange background with fewer cells. Perhaps alpha 5 gets merged with the coffee shop you are always at when you see alpha 5, so that increasingly large groups of associations can be represented with increasingly fewer neurons at a higher level in the cortex, similar to the subject line of an email, or the headline of a news article, or the title of a paper. By the time we get to conscious thinking, we are at the news headline of news headlines, we are at the grand summary of grand summaries, the conscious thoughts are macro summaries of vast blankets of group associations learned through life experience so that no matter what direction you look, you can spot many complicated objects almost instantly, because they have all been linked via short cuts that use few cells to trigger vast networks of previous associations, that help you predict what is real now. 
Micah Blumberg So information is encoded in neural activity via learned associations in bunches of cells, these associations are mapping our experiences, and providing expectations to other bunches of associated neurons representing maps of other internal representations, corresponding with life experience. In a way we are these previous life experiences, predictions that represent previous associations including association between maps of associated cells from all the other previous life experiences. The out put from these cells, when the neurons fire, is our expectation of what we are experiencing now, our expectations come to meet our new experiences almost like the waves coming to meet the shores of our nations. As the shore of new experience comes in, it's sorted by or into the previous maps of reality, until such a time when it's overwhelmed by the new data so much that a major change in the internal maps takes place, representing a change in a person after a very significant life experience. Pushing this threshold is something I am very interested in, that's why I do neurofeedback with brainwave entrainment with light and sound as my business!

Awareness as we know it, is really a dynamic electric expectation, self-awareness comes about because of a feedback loop, between brainwaves, body movement, and incoming senses. When you add neurofeedback, you expand your self-awareness even more, which means gaining even more self control. Neurofeedback is cool, what I do at my office (Neomindcycle.com) is even more cool then traditional neurofeedback!
