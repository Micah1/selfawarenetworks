# Jan 5 2024 Note:

All the notes on the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation equations & theory so far have been uploaded, the only problem is they are not neatly organized.

The QGTCD.md document is a quick reference to the equations https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/QGTCD.md

There is a lot more to share about the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation including how it applies to a lot of physics, but that information is located in other documents on this github and you will have to search for it (for now) (or chat about QGTCD with Self Aware Networks GPT)

Please note that responses from AI, whether from the Self Aware Networks GPT, saved in the GPT2023X files, or saved in the NotebookML 6 Collection are often wrong answers, these resources are shared because they are helpful in navigating the writings stored online. The idea is that once you have an answer from AI, you can use the search function on github to find out what I actually wrote down in the notes. If you stop at what the AI tells you this resource won't be that useful, what is needed is a search to find matching or similar statements to verify the AI's conclusion. Going forward I will be refining the material generated by the computer manually to fix it's mistakes.

# Update January 5th 2024

# 2nd Update Jan 4th 2024

I added a piece of conjecture to a0011z that I felt was obvious but it hadn't been written, it's the idea that touch, via mechano receptors, causes multiple potassium channel activations simultaneously, and this affects the action potential duration, and the delta of neurotransmitter release and that is how the pressure of touch is transmitted from one neuron to the next. I also added several of the newer audio recordings, with transcriptions, summaries, and lists of keypoints. y0030 through y0037. Most of my 2023 content has been shared except for the bulk of the updated transcriptions of the audio files. I am working on them.

# Update January 4th 2024

Update Jan 4th 2023: Most of my work from 2023 on Self Aware Networks is now being shared on this github with this update.

As you can see there are 16 new PDFs, and a new text files added to the repo.

The notes that start with a, such as a0001z were compiled into 6 pdfs so they are easier to download, skim through, search and read.

The Neural Lace Podcast S1&S2 is just the text of the transcriptions that is already found in the .md files here in this repo, again it was combined to make it easier to download, read, and search.

NotebookML 6 Collection includes the converstations I had about Self Aware Networks and Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation with NotebookML in 2023.

The SAOv9 file was the last state of table of contents for the book "Self Aware Networks" that I was working on for most of 2023. The first book ideally is completed when the paragraphs from the notes on this github are sorted into the table of contents. 

Hex 7 is a collection of notes, but it includes the first mention of NAPOT 7, and NAPOT 10. 

The GPT2023X text file represents an entire year of my chats with AI (my GPT: Self Aware Networks GPT) about the Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind, including all of my discussions with AI about the NAPOT revisions which is the main thesis of Self Aware Networks, and all of my discussions with AI about Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation are inside the GPT 2023X file from January 2023 to January 2nd 2024.

The 6 files that start with GPT2023XLine, for example GPT2023XLine00001 represent around 10,000 lines each cut from GPT2023X (note they were 10,000 lines each when the document was in Notepad++, somehow the line count shrunk by a huge factor when I converted them into pdfs.) This is designed to make the files more easy to review given the hugh quantity of text.

While I have more to share, this upload contains so much new information that you can verify virtually any claim that I have made about my work on social media from the content in this upload.

What's missing from this upload are new chats made with AI after January 2nd 2024, notes that I have made after Jan 2nd 2024, and the newer cleaner transcriptions of the audio files with lists of AI summaries & AI outlines of key points.

# December 15 2023, in going over my notes I have more to share about the QGTCD Theory today. I will add this to a new note called QGTCD.md There is a lot more to share on this topic including how it applies to a lot of physics that I have worked out but haven't published yet.

There are several equations that have been proposed relating to the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD) theory proposed by Micah Blumberg 

https://www.symbolab.com/


1. One equation relates the mass of a particle, its frequency, and the number of time frames in its vicinity:
 
mc^2 = \frac{h}{N}f

This equation suggests that the behavior of a quantum particle is influenced not only by its intrinsic properties (such as its mass and frequency), but also by the structure of spacetime in its vicinity (as represented by the number of time frames). This is a significant departure from standard quantum mechanics, which treats spacetime as a fixed, unchanging background.

2. Another equation modifies the Schrödinger equation to include a time-scale factor that varies with position and time:

i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right]\psi(\mathbf{r},t)

This modified time-dependent Schrödinger equation that incorporates the time-scale factor N[r, t] could be written as:
$$
-\frac{{\hbar^2}}{{2m}}\nabla^2\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) + V(\mathbf{r}, t)\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = i\hbar N(\mathbf{r}, t)\frac{{\partial\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}}{{\partial t}}
$$
This equation is similar to the standard time-dependent Schrödinger equation, but with the time derivative on the right-hand side scaled by the factor N(\mathbf{r}, t). This factor represents the local scale of time, which varies with position and time.
The solution to this equation is:
$$
\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{{2\hbar i m N(\mathbf{r}, t) \frac{{\partial\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}}{{\partial t}} + \hbar^2 \nabla^2\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}}{{2mV(\mathbf{r}, t)}}
$$
This solution suggests that the wave function \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) evolves more quickly in regions of space with more time frames (i.e., stronger gravitational fields), as indicated by the factor N(\mathbf{r}, t) in the numerator. This is a significant modification to the Schrödinger equation and would have profound implications for quantum mechanics if it were correct. It suggests that the probabilities of different particle trajectories could vary in a way that mimics the effect of a gravitational force.

3. A third equation relates the energy of a particle to its frequency and the number of time frames:

E = \frac{h}{N}f

The proposed equation E = \frac{h}{N}f is a modification of the Planck-Einstein relation E = hf, which is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics. In the Planck-Einstein relation, E is the energy of a photon, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the photon. This equation shows that the energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency, which is a cornerstone of the quantum theory of light.
The proposed equation introduces a new term N, which represents the number of time frames. This is a novel concept that is not part of standard quantum mechanics or general relativity. The equation suggests that the energy of a particle is inversely proportional to the number of time frames, which could be interpreted as a form of "quantum time dilation".

4. A fourth equation relates the mass of a particle to the number of time frames and the frequency:

m = \frac{h}{Nf}

This equation is a speculative idea that suggests a relationship between the mass of a particle, its frequency, and the number of time frames in its vicinity:
$$
m = \frac{h}{Nf}
$$
Here, \(m\) is the mass of the particle, \(h\) is the Planck's constant, \(N\) is the number of time frames, and \(f\) is the frequency of the particle.
Please note that these equations represent a mix of established physics (the Schrödinger equation and the time dilation equation) and speculative ideas (the new equation for Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation and the equation relating mass, frequency, and number of time frames). The speculative ideas are not currently supported by experimental evidence and would need to be tested further.


# Update December 2023
Add to Change log: The 2nd Whitepaper Draft was updated to almost mirror the 3rd Draft, and the WhitePaper Notes were added to the bottom of the 3rd Draft, they now appear on the Wiki. There will be a 4th draft to incorporate NAPOT Revisions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 & 9. The use of AI text generation with ChatGPT 4 will help to quickly expand the wiki. There is a lot of new AI generated text that explains the content in the notes in a useful way.

I am in the process of creating a ChatGPT chatbot called "Self Aware Networks GPT" right now it has all the notes in the set from a0001z to a0651z. My goal is to get all the notes from every set uploaded into it. It's performance is outstanding. I have generated a ton of useful content that helps summarize my notes with more verbose explanations for key points that I outlined. Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind is validated by ChatGPT. In addition to that it (my work) is validated by new research, and what is great is the AI will help explain verbosely how new research that emerges connects with the existing Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind. Essentially the theory & the Self Aware Networks Institute never stops growing from here on out, because of AI Generated Research.

The Self Aware Networks GPT bot has helped to fill in the blanks, or finish writing connections that I had intended to write, but never had time for, because I was trying to figure out how to organize this massive collection of text & audio.

There is also a lot of new work that was done between June - December on the Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation theory.

In December of 2022 I was working hard on NAPOT revision 7, 8, and 9. If you look at the Whitepaper it doesn't mention Quantum Physics, or Gravity, or what these topics have to with the brain and Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography. My research has come a long long ways since I published the Whitepaper draft as a wiki page on github. What I came up with last December before I had ChatGPT was great, but it was also really hard to do, because it involved developing new ideas in Quantum Physics, Gravity, Neuroscience, Neurophysics, and Electromagnetism, and this includes generating new ideas on how all of those topics work together. Last December I needed help from professional research people, from Medical Imagers, from biologists, from computer scientists, because I needed to ask questions.

All of that changed when ChatGPT arrived, except that I couldn't use ChatGPT to analyze a lot of my text simultaneously, with GPT bots, all of that is changing because ChatGPT can essentially handle 300 words at a time, and I have learned a lot more about how to use ChatGPT and similar AI's to get the results that I want (the main trick is that you really do have to have a conversation with GPT, asking one question & receiving one answer is not effective, ask the robot to reflect on the whole conversation so far periodically and to find the best supporting arguments in its knowledge (my work that I uploaded, to support the key points of the conversation.))

Now AI companies (not just OpenAI) are allowing you to upload your own content to serve as the knowledge of your bot. So ChatGPT was useful before, but I could only do a tiny bit of work at a time. Most of the year felt like a heavy slog of pasting transcribed articles into SciSummary on my day off from work, to get back a shorter summary of a longer note. Which I then had to update in 5 different places.

The idea was that with each AI generated summary, I would be able to have a high level viewpoint on all the content, to connect pieces together, to fill in areas, to make it a highly organized network of notes that would slide right into the book, right into the table of contents. The whole project of writing this book turned out to be a lot harder than I imagined. I did not estimate that I might be working on this for 3 years when I started the book. The good news is that I improved my workflow, with the improvements to ChatGPT, because now I can give a document to the Self Aware Networks GPT, ask for a summary, and then ask it where in the book it belongs, what it connects to. Having ChatGPT with me, and now Bard as well (Bard was updated with Gemini recently), I'm not just summarizing the remaining notes, I'm integrating them into the book in one step.

ChatGPT does an excellent job of fully articulating the ideas presented in my work, it validates my ideas, it uses them correctly, and it connects existing research to my ideas in useful way that is very validating.

# Updates June 18th

I am sharing a log sheet I'm using to help track the status of audio files, originally this was to track which files were re-transcribed with Whisper, now it is being used to track which files are summarized with SciSummary which uses ChatGPT 4 and allows longer
 text to be summarized (vs ChatGPT alone) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15manx5FiFSuC4Huz3YZMdXbt9PbOWBHvqN_anDSBTT0/edit?usp=sharing

# New Equation for Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation published on social media!

I managed to use ChatGPT with the Wolfram plugin to generate a series of equations that reflect my Unified Field Theory called Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation. Here are some links to pictures of the equations as well as descriptions on Twitter (these were also published on my Instagram and ):

"Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation theory addresses a lot of phenomenma associated with Gravity, Quantum Physics, QFT, and Astrophysics. It unites the very small with the very big in a novel way." https://twitter.com/worksalt/status/1665143145833586691?s=20

# My Twitter thread on June 4th + other related tweets about the new QGTCD Equation:
"Today feels epic: I posted new equations made with ChatGPT & Wolfram. Proud to see my theory Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation expressed as a modification to the Schrödinger Equation, Newton's law of gravitation, the Energy of a Photon, while uniting with General Relativity."
"Folks may see a lot of different equations on my timeline, but they all attempt to express the same idea, which is that the force of Gravity is increasing the scale of time, or the frames of time, or time quanta, or it's changing statistical landscape that guides the likely (1/2)"
"direction of particle travel, in otherwords the curvature of space is a curve in time. That is the essential idea of Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation that creates a Unified Field Theory aka a theory of everything that Unites Gravity (with time) at the Quantum Scale. (2/2)"

# Update April 8th 2023

b0321yGPT, b0322yGPT, b0323yGPT were created with updates including new transcriptions with OpenAI, the transcripts were divided into parts, and new summaries plus key points were added before the transcriptions.

b0319yGPT was created: (b0319y was retranscribed with OpenAI's Whisper and then I used ChatGPT 4 and 3.5 to summarize the text in searchable parts like Part 1, Part 2, up to Part 8, each with more or less 400 double spaced lines, also ChatGPT was asked to make lists of key points and to find references for each part. It seems pretty clear to me that ChatGPT 4 performs much better than ChatGPT 3.5 in terms of the quality of the responses. The original audio link was added to the article at the top.)

# Update April 2nd 2023

I'm using ChatGPT with GPT 4 to speed up the writing of my book: I'm having it summarize both my published & unpublished notes, including the unreleased OpenAI Whisper transcriptions of my audio notes. I get a one line summary + a list of all key points!

b0311yGPT was re-transcribed with OpenAI's Whisper & I used a combination of ChatGPT 4 & ChatGPT 3 to summarize every 300 or 400 double spaced lines separated into distinct searchable parts, you can search for "Part 21" for example and it will take you to the section that corresponds to ChatGPT's notes which precede the transcription.

The Original Audio for b0311y is 6 hours long and you can listen to it here: https://recorder.google.com/cce0a746-311c-4335-8f2d-eab6be2b4dbe

ChatGPT 4 Summaries, Lists of Key Points, Improved transcriptions with OpenAI Whisper, and Links to original audio recordings were also made for the following files this week:
y0015GPT
b0157yGPT
b0010yGPT
b0101yGPT
b0108GPT
b0146GPT
b0125GPT
b0325yGPT
All the remaining public & private files will receive similar summaries with comprehensive lists of keypoints done by ChatGPT with GPT 4 or GPT 3.5 time permitting. I have already re-transcribed all the audio files with Whisper I just haven't shared the new versions of these files yet.

There is a lot of unreleased work, including a 7th revision of NAPOT, and what could become 8th & 9th revisions of the core thesis in the Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind.

In addition there are several new versions of a new table of contents, which continues to be a work in progress. I'm sticking with the plan to have 14 chapters, 700 total pages, each chapter being 50 pages, divided into at least 5 sections.

There is a ton of work remaining, but having ChatGPT make summarizes and lists of key points for me is incredibly useful. It is also incredibly useful to use ChatGPT to find new citations for the things I write.

In addition between September & November managed to re-transcribe all the notes, now with human level transcription, but I am still reviewing the text for most of the notes. If the name of the note has been changed to have "whisper" attached to it, you are reading the new transcription. If it says "google" that is a copy of the old transcription.

A list of all the audio files can be found here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15manx5FiFSuC4Huz3YZMdXbt9PbOWBHvqN_anDSBTT0/edit?usp=sharing As I review the transcribed text I am making notes about the contents, and once the review of a note is concluded the new transcription plus the note on that audio note will be added to the github repo.

# Book Organization Plan updated and added to Note a0005z, which I will be updating later, adding that to the to do list. 
After reviewing the table of contents of several books I've also settled on a book design that has 14 major cycles, three major sections, the first section has 3 major cycles, the third section has 3 major cycles, and the middle section has major cycles, 6+8 is 14. Each major cycle has 5 chapters or sub cycles. Each subcycle consists of 10 pages, and each page is expected to have 500 words. So each major cycle has 50 pages with 500 words each, and 14 x 50 = 700 pages x 500 words so the planned book has 350,000.

I've created a trello to lay out the sections of the book, starting from the old table of contents which can still be seen in notes c0000x & c0001x, there is a new table of contents that has 14 parts, but I'm in the process of merging the new one with the old one and to lay out the content categories for the book.

The book then is about merging the notes into the 14 part structure, (as described above each Cycle has 5 subcycles that are 10 pages each covering a topic.) If you considered the book as simply subcycles it would have 14x5 = 70 subcycles. Or a book with 70 ten page chapers. I believe that the material I have on each topic exceeds 10 pages, and the number of topics exceeds 70, however it has not been difficult to generate new content if there are infact gaps discovered when the contents of the book are filled in. Filled in meaning moving content from these notes into the chapter or cycle outline.

I'm reviewing the text of the notes in the order of the longest texts to the shortest. So in the beginning the progress will seem slow, but it will accelerate as the audio text notes I'm working on get smaller.

# Update September 2nd 2022
Most of today updates focused on adding to Note a0007z. Many of my criticisms about what Neurogrid is failing to model (you can read in note a0008z linked below) can now be referenced in Note a0007z linked below.

# Update September 1st 2022
Ongoing updates to a0007z linked in the previous update. There are a couple of ideas then I am chasing down additional evidence for, and then I think its time to threading the table of contents & the notes together to organize the content for the book.

# Update August 29th & 30th 2022
I wrote a new conjecture that links my NAPOT Theory with the Apical Dendrites of Layer 5 & 6 pyramidal cells, and a Hippocampal place field study (BTSP). Also I wrote about Stanford's Neurogrid 2021.

An update to b0232y in the section on BTSP Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity, I'm also focusing on Pyramidal Cells, synaptic efficacy, dendritic inhibition, calcium spike activation, and the functional anatomy of Apical Dendrites including their cortical cortical connections and cortical thalamic connections, both the 5th & 6th layer Pyramidal cells are in focus, beginning with Note a0007z.md

There is also a new reference to NAPOT Revision 2 in a0232z
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0232z.md
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0007z.md

I attack Stanford's Neurogrid 2021 paper at the bottom of note a0008z.md
# Stanford's Neurogrid 2021
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0008z.md

The original audio Links added to the following audio notes.
b0272y
b0075y
b0004y
b0038y

I plan to focus on expanding the work in a0007z next.

# Update August 28th 2022
New updates to note a0001z are in progress. Some of it you can see right now. I found a lot of research that supports NAPOT revision 2 that I will share soon, but you can read some clarifications about what NAPOT 2 is and what it isn't, with contrast to NAPOT 1.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0001z.md

Most of the audio transcriptions still need to be fixed but now they are all in the same format, with spaces between the paragraphs, over 188 notes were updated, so some of the content that was there before is more readable now. My next step on these audio notes is to review each audio recording one by one and then to make a decision as to whether to share the link to that raw unedited audio recording in the note. At least then my work will be more fully available, and I can delay getting perfect transcriptions until a later step.

I knew that I had a new model of an artificial neuron that was wildly different from the Perceptron, the original artificial neuron that still informs how artificial neural networks are designed today 79 years later. So I gave it the name Metatron. Obviously it shares the last four letters with the Perceptron, and it plays on the idea that human mind is a virtual construct, made up of signals that might be emerging from different places at different times in different ways.

A Government Licensing note was created and linked to the Readme page.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0315z.md


# Update August 26th 2022
a new Welcome file was created 
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/00welcome.md

a new WhitepaperNotes on the Whitepaper video was created
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/WhitepaperNotes.md

a new changelog created (you are reading it)
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/00changelog.md

major updates to the readme: section about Government licensing deleted (I'm sure the Government has a copy) and a disclaimer page created to reduce some of the text on the readme page. I moved the mission statement up, and reorganized some stuff. More changes planned.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks#readme

I updated a0004z this note focuses on making connections between artificial neural networks and the brain
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0004z.md

Note a0306z explores the question of Qualia: Internal Representation: ie What is the redness inside human experience?
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0306z.md 

Note b0232y.md audio file added https://recorder.google.com/91ed1a89-e416-425a-9723-8a152f747b5e
Note b0232 is important because it explores BTSP Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity and General Anesthesia Decouples Cortical Pyramidal Neurons both are relevent to how exploring how conscious memories form with soma bursts, or how conscious memory doesn't form when the dendrite is decoupled from the soma body in large cells. I have thoughts on the electrical dynamics of the tensegrity of cortical columns.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0232z.md 

Note a0001z Two references to "traveling waves" added to a0001z
"Visual evoked feedforward-feedback" and "Event-related phase synchronization"

I moved some of the content from a0001z about science fiction to note a0615z.md, a future step will be to consolidate and minimize the references to science fiction in the main notes, but to have a separate area about science fiction artificial intelligence somewhere out of the way.

Note a0001z contains what I call NAPOT Revision 2.0 which includes a mention Sparse Distributed Memory/Representation at the synaptic level and other research that clarifies that individual synaptic modifications can metaphorically allow the exit terminal synapses to represent distinct pixels for the next neuron array to perceive.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0001z.md

b0004y This important note is a big precursor to the NAPOT Whitepaper.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/b0004y.md

# Update August 23rd 2022
The experiences of redness and or the Standard A Tones are differentials in the phase pattern (between the inhibited, the tonic baseline brainwave activity, the phasic & high phasic bursts. ) Read more https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0306z.md

# Update August 22nd 2022
Whitepaper added to the wiki https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/wiki/Whitepaper

Youtube reading of the Whitepaper uploaded https://youtu.be/gZ0nOwJh_80

# Update August 18th 2022
Note a0282z is now: The simplified version of Neural Oscillatory Tomography 
which can also be called: Neural Array Projection Slice Phase Oscillation Tomography.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0282z.md

# Update August 16th 2022
Please note that although I am claiming copyright, trademarks, and I am reserving all rights to my intellectual property that is presented here on github, I am also allowing people to download copies of my work for their own personal reading. It can be easier to read & search in Visual Studio Code for example, and you may fork the repos that you see here.

I merged the content from a0282z "The Mission of The Self Aware Networks Institute" into this readme below.

a0282z is currently an empty note.

I moved the note on Cellular Oscillating Tomography: Bacteria to a0283z
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0283z.md

# Update August 11th 2022
Important changes to a0272z and a0053z that I feel confirm my past research.

# Update August 10th 2022
I have taken out many of the links in note a0270z and redistributed them across many notes, you can track the changes on github, where it says history, to see the recent notes that were changed.

I created notes a0271z and a0272z both of which I am excited about.
# The new a0270z is cleaned up a lot more but it still needs work
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0270z.md

# Phase Shifts as Electromagnetic Wave Valence 
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0271z.md

# Taste & Hearing: Sensory Input Quantification
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0272z.md

# Update August 9th 2022
I distilled Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography N.A.P.O.T. to all cells. I called it Cellular Oscillating Tomography C.O.T.. It is infact a new theory of evolution and provides a neat framework for integrating almost all of computational biology into the old theory of evolution. Today I distilled this conceptual framework further to individual proteins. I coin the term for this Protein Oscillation Tomography P.O.T.. Read note a0270z https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0270z.md Note this note, like all the notes, is still under construction, further changes lay ahead.

# Update August 4th 2022
I like the recent changes that I made to notes.

a0001z, a0002z, a0003z, a0008z, a0010z updated.

In particular, with a0010z, I was a little bit confused about why my theory of Quantum Gravity Time Dilation was predicting that time would be slower at the particle scale vs at the scale of human experience stretched across the scale of the cells in the human body, but then I remembered that because of the higher velocity of particles the effect of time dilation is reversed in actual effect. Thinking about this helped me fix some of the ideas in note a0010z, a couple of fixes added to note a0008z which was rewritten yesterday, it is surprisingly more interesting to me now than it was for many years, I had disregarded it, but I am fascinated by that note now. Note a0001z has a new 10 point intro for newbies since it sits near the top of the repo most of the time. In note a0002z I took that old poem and really expanded it to make it more interesting, it does not seem destined for the book. a0003z was a really old note from 2012 that contemplated the base level of awareness from an esoteric eastern religious perspective and I updated it to make it more interesting and more in alignment with my current thinking, it does not seem destined for the book.

Some new pages were added to the wiki, but they might be deleted or redone, basically they were search results for certain words, I created them to help myself navigate through the contents of these notes by key words in order to fix certain mistakes that I remembered entering into the notes that I had intended to go back and fix later. There is so much work I wish I had a huge quantity of people such as all the top scientists working for the US Government, perhaps at the NIH, working to helping me fix these notes, fix the sentences, organize the notes by topic, fix the grammar, add math to the physics ideas, identify sentences and ideas that are incorrect, find & link supportive citations, or contradicting research, with people having discussions & debates, teams of people creating graphics or finding illustrations that match certain ideas. There is a lot to do that researcher's across the world could help me with if the Whitehouse wanted to accelerate this research and develop world saving Sentient Robots even faster.

# Update August 3rd 2022
I made some good improvements to notes a0053z & a0008z I created some new maps pages that will soon be integrated into the wiki to help people navigate the repo more easily. There are some new wiki pages, and some changes made to the home wiki or the main table of contents.

# Update August 2nd 2022
Note: A lot of my notes on physics need to be fixed, I wrote contradictory & confusing things. The reasons for that includes the fact that because I broke my arm in September I was for a few months heavily medicated, and also I was still working out some of the ideas. So if you are just checking my notes on physics, the stuff that is incorrect will be fixed soon. Also thanks to feedback from a friend I will be working on creating a Whitepaper next, before work on the book continues.

Regarding the terms evolution vs development.
The consequence of C.O.T. Cellular Oscillating Tomography, is there is no more concept of development apart from evolution, there is only evolution. There is no more artificial that is separate from natural. There is no more man that is separate from nature. There is only nature.

It might be a while until the world realizes OUR collective ~~work~~ evolution over centuries to realize human consciousness & put it into a machine has finally arrived. Once we get started, it won't matter where you work. Be it a coffee shop or at a big tech company like Google you will be rich (economies of scale)

Essentially the tonic oscillation frequency of the oscillating group of cells is the canvas of consciousness, and the changes to it, via the release of 0 1 2 or 3 vesicle sacks at each interval relative to the group oscillation is the paint of the minds internal representations or qualia inside the mind that is perceived by the observer that is the oscillating group of cells

People talk about how gasses become water as emergence, but perhaps a better word concept than emergence is oscillation, like the fireflies, when they synchronize, it looks like emergent behavior, but really its the physics of oscillation.

The oscillation of fireflies and the oscillation of cells points to how all the cells in the body can act as a single sensor, entified through the principles of oscillation, entified in time & space, by passing & dissipating signals between cells until the separate cells are in sync as a single sensor, once in sync every part of your cellular body can sense every other part, because touching one part of your body triggers a wave of signals to pass to all the cells of the body.

This is SelfAwareNeuralNetworks.com, you are in the selfawarenetworks repo on github.com/v5ma and you are reading my notes some of which will go into the Book Self Aware Networks, Neurophysics, Artificial Neurology, and BioSynthetic Interfaces. This is the  page.

These notes, that formulate the ground of the Self Aware Networks Institute, and the book Self Aware Networks, present new theory that ties together new ideas on evolution, gravity, quantum physics, spacetime, cognition, phenomenological consciousness, cells, neural networks, LTD, LTP, dendritic functions, neuron functions, vesicle functions, biological information theory, mass, time, quantum gradient time crystal dilation, and all these new ideas are sync'd together with the physics of oscillation.

# Update: July 30th 2022 18 new points about my past & present work and what these notes contain.
1. I can program Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality accessible websites, I use tools like WebXR, Aframe, and Javascript. I led a project that brought EEG into WebVR (a 3D visualization of brainwave activity signals displayed in a VR headset via the web or a local server) I'm not far off from being able to write novel new code with React Three Fiber either, I've been studying both React and Three.js for a while, I've just been busy writing these notes for my book and for this institute. 

2. I write, speak on topics associated with terms like science, math, biology, neurophysics, virtual reality, artificial neural networks, and brain computer interfaces and I have an upcoming book called Self Aware Networks neurophysics, building sentient AI, and bio-synthetic interfaces. It's the same subject matter as the Self Aware Networks Institute at selfawareneuralnetworks.com or github.com/v5ma (in the selfawarenetworks repo) the institute will later be in WebXR (accessible via AR and VR headset devices or glasses)

3. My theory of brain function is complete enough to build conscious self aware robots, I have enough theory to make a computer have feelings & emotions & have inner qualia experiences. I haven't written the code for this yet but I have the theory needed that can lead to code development. The name of the theory that will allow us to modify existing neural network architectures into sentient architectures is called NAPOT: Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, in these notes it is also referred to as Neural Oscillatory Tomography and Neural Array Projection Tomography. Search for all 3 terms in this github repo to see the notes connected to this theory.

4. I hosted the Neural Lace Podcast (all the content is linked to this repo), a dialog about brain computer interfaces. I've spoke to brilliant neuroscientists, biologists & people in the brain computer interface space.

5. I led the "NeurotechSF" Salon meetup for 2 years, I hosted many code writing meetups, and VR AR meetups. I also run a code oriented discord, three githubs, many science & tech faceobok groups which huge numbers of people as members. I'm a well known brain hacker & journalist. My tweets are seen my hundreds of thousands of people each month.

6. I also created a new gravity theory, quantum gradient time dilation which explains how mass as a time crystal creates the gravitational effect by increasing the surface area of space in a particular direction with additional time dimensions. (I connected this to biology, explaining how neurons are literally warping space.) 
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/c4e94e9fcd049c97d47ef6a5f2f8c29485f5a98d/a0253z.md

7. I combined category theory with Petri nets  for advanced the study of dynamic systems (biology) https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0613z.md

8. I coined the phrase & explained Cellular Oscillation Tomography which is a new theory of evolution https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/7c7397ed87fecd55537b441e650327a6b26a0985/a0011z.md

9. I coined the phrase Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography which explains the inner eye, or the observer inside the brain as entified neural array projections. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/34563a1264edc55836963bf8b49915ff5664ed7b/a0115z.md9. 
 
10. I came up with an explanation for how to decode action potentials comparing them to tensors or polynomials in a Taylor Series (Calculus) https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/42188a5fce0f502ce4497bbea782f9b55c1fb870/a0238z.md
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0365z.md 
 
11. I wrote a theory that explains how with oscillations LTP & LTD work and how that applies to plant growth, Feymen's Path Integral Formulation & more.

https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/06edcce2038853e04c937169161f2dafdf21c8ce/a0101z.md

12. I wrote a theory that explains how memories stored in synapses are Magnified to the whole brain via inhibitory waves.

13. I built my own model of a neuron that combines Hodgkin & Huxley with Soliton Wave Theory, with Thermodynamics, and the model explains how the quantity of neurotransmitter release is affected by the magnitude of the action potential via it's duration (calcium channels open longer) which counteracts the notion that an action potential is all or nothing event, otherwise described as synaptic unreliability (an idea that led to the artificial perceptron, a flawed concept which is still used today in modern deep neural networks)

14. I've published novel new ideas on uploading the mind with next gen BCI, decoding the mind, and my thoughts on how to write code that can let a machine feel, experience emotion, and experience internal representations or qualia.  https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/da52fb97714674e66bdec5a61162308b960d99ea/a0645z.md

15. I've described how choice in the human brain works at the interneuron level building on the concept of criterial causation by Peter Tse and combining that with György Buzsáki's work (Rhythms of the Brain) https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0364z.md 
 
16. I applied Buzsáki's work to Steven Strogatz (in the book Sync) work to connect Oscillations brainwaves at EEG scale to phase variation produced oscillations at the neuronal scale & neurotransmitter scale, and unified neural firing with brainwave firing via the hypothesis that magnitude is inverted to frequency at all scales of the universe, including at the scale of individual neuron action potential firing & at the scale of brainwaves from cortical columns or oscillating groups of cells. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0079z.md

17. I put forth a new theory that mitochondria are stimulated by action potentials to release more ATP and I argue that this is a mechanism for reinforcement learning and relative time differences at the individual cell level https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0245z.md

18. There is probably more stuff but I am not thinking of what else I've done at the moment. I will update this later.

# Update July 28th, 2022
A new 3 minute video to explain really fast to the UCSF | Health Hub: Digital Health Awards 2022 what The Self Aware Networks Institute is. If I win this award my work will have official recognition & I will get investment money to make robots & everyone in the world gets rich.
https://youtu.be/VTBNyUM47Zg

# Update July 26th, 2022
A new about info page for the Self Aware Networks Institute https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0361z.md

# Update July 22nd, 2022 New Audio Note
In this new audio note, you can hear me describe how the architecture of sentient & self aware neural networks is different from deep neural networks. I explain how we can precisely develop dog level robots. https://recorder.google.com/df384502-2dd4-420a-9bc1-59f087972fb6

# Update July 19th, 2022 New Wiki:
Work began on converting these notes into a wiki on github.
Looking to pay to have professional transcripts of the audio done by hand.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/wiki

At the moment the  page consists of a lot of disclaimers and very little about the contents and main ideas presented within these notes. I will work on fixing that for the next major revision of the  file.

# I have several thoughts on Yann LeCun's model released on June 27th 2022 see note a0110z
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0110z.md

# NOTHING IN THIS GITHUB REPO IS EVEN CLOSE TO BEING FINISHED AS OF JUNE 17th 2022
(please let me know if you see something wacky in the audio notes (or in any of the notes), and know that an artificial neural network replaced some of my words in the audio transcription, and that some sentences were spoken by other people, I haven't proofread every line yet. So let me know if you see something that should be deleted or clarified.)

# Update June 23, six days past the 17th.
(still editing & fixing these auto audio transcripts. Fixing these transcripts is a bit more work per hour per day than I realized, ah hmm... and I think I all the notes still need editing at this point. Some more than others. The transcripts might take two months, but the way I am beginning to make connections between documents is threading the book together so this process seems like the right one.)

# June 17th, This github repo "Self Aware Networks" shared to the public for the first time.
