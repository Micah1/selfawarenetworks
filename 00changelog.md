# Update August 29th 2022
I wrote a new conjecture that links my NAPOT Theory with the Apical Dendrites of Layer 5 & 6 pyramidal cells, and a Hippocampal place field study (BTSP). Also I wrote about Stanford's Neurogrid 2021. I will share more when I am on wifi again later.

An update to b0232y in the section on BTSP Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity, I'm also focusing on Pyramidal Cells, synaptic efficacy, dendritic inhibition, calcium spike activation, and the functional anatomy of Apical Dendrites including their cortical cortical connections and cortical thalamic connections, both the 5th & 6th layer Pyramidal cells are in focus, beginning with Note a0007z.md

https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0007z.md

I attack Stanford's Neurogrid 2021 paper at the bottom of note a0008z.md
# Stanford's Neurogrid 2021

# Update August 28th 2022
New updates to note a0001z are in progress. Some of it you can see right now. I found a lot of research that supports NAPOT revision 2 that I will share soon, but you can read some clarifications about what NAPOT 2 is and what it isn't, with contrast to NAPOT 1.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0001z.md

Most of the audio transcriptions still need to be fixed but now they are all in the same format, with spaces between the paragraphs, over 188 notes were updated, so some of the content that was there before is more readable now. My next step on these audio notes is to review each audio recording one by one and then to make a decision as to whether to share the link to that raw unedited audio recording in the note. At least then my work will be more fully available, and I can delay getting perfect transcriptions until a later step.

I knew that I had a new model of an artificial neuron that was wildly different from the Perceptron, the original artificial neuron that still informs how artificial neural networks are designed today 79 years later. So I gave it the name Metatron. Obviously it shares the last four letters with the Perceptron, and it plays on the idea that human mind is a virtual construct, made up of signals that might be emerging from different places at different times in different ways.

A Government Licensing note was created and linked to the Readme page.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0315z.md


# Update August 26th 2022
a new Welcome file was created 
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/00welcome.md

a new WhitepaperNotes on the Whitepaper video was created
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/WhitepaperNotes.md

a new changelog created (you are reading it)
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/00changelog.md

major updates to the readme: section about Government licensing deleted (I'm sure the Government has a copy) and a disclaimer page created to reduce some of the text on the readme page. I moved the mission statement up, and reorganized some stuff. More changes planned.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks#readme

I updated a0004z this note focuses on making connections between artificial neural networks and the brain
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0004z.md

Note a0306z explores the question of Qualia: Internal Representation: ie What is the redness inside human experience?
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0306z.md 

Note b0232y.md audio file added https://recorder.google.com/91ed1a89-e416-425a-9723-8a152f747b5e
Note b0232 is important because it explores BTSP Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity and General Anesthesia Decouples Cortical Pyramidal Neurons both are relevent to how exploring how conscious memories form with soma bursts, or how conscious memory doesn't form when the dendrite is decoupled from the soma body in large cells. I have thoughts on the electrical dynamics of the tensegrity of cortical columns.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0232z.md 

Note a0001z Two references to "traveling waves" added to a0001z
"Visual evoked feedforward-feedback" and "Event-related phase synchronization"

I moved some of the content from a0001z about science fiction to note a0615z.md, a future step will be to consolidate and minimize the references to science fiction in the main notes, but to have a separate area about science fiction artificial intelligence somewhere out of the way.

Note a0001z contains what I call NAPOT Revision 2.0 which includes a mention Sparse Distributed Memory/Representation at the synaptic level and other research that clarifies that individual synaptic modifications can metaphorically allow the exit terminal synapses to represent distinct pixels for the next neuron array to perceive.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0001z.md

b0004y This important note is a big precursor to the NAPOT Whitepaper.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/b0004y.md

# Update August 22nd 2022
Whitepaper added to the wiki https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/wiki/Whitepaper

Youtube reading of the Whitepaper uploaded https://youtu.be/gZ0nOwJh_80

# Update August 18th 2022
Note a0282z is now: The simplified version of Neural Oscillatory Tomography 
which can also be called: Neural Array Projection Slice Phase Oscillation Tomography.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0282z.md

# Update August 16th 2022
Please note that although I am claiming copyright, trademarks, and I am reserving all rights to my intellectual property that is presented here on github, I am also allowing people to download copies of my work for their own personal reading. It can be easier to read & search in Visual Studio Code for example, and you may fork the repos that you see here.

I merged the content from a0282z "The Mission of The Self Aware Networks Institute" into this readme below.

a0282z is currently an empty note.

I moved the note on Cellular Oscillating Tomography: Bacteria to a0283z
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0283z.md

# Update August 11th 2022
Important changes to a0272z and a0053z that I feel confirm my past research.

# Update August 10th 2022
I have taken out many of the links in note a0270z and redistributed them across many notes, you can track the changes on github, where it says history, to see the recent notes that were changed.

I created notes a0271z and a0272z both of which I am excited about.
# The new a0270z is cleaned up a lot more but it still needs work
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0270z.md

# Phase Shifts as Electromagnetic Wave Valence

# Taste & Hearing: Sensory Input Quantification
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0272z.md

# Update August 9th 2022
I distilled Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography N.A.P.O.T. to all cells. I called it Cellular Oscillating Tomography C.O.T.. It is infact a new theory of evolution and provides a neat framework for integrating almost all of computational biology into the old theory of evolution. Today I distilled this conceptual framework further to individual proteins. I coin the term for this Protein Oscillation Tomography P.O.T.. Read note a0270z https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0270z.md Note this note, like all the notes, is still under construction, further changes lay ahead.

# Update August 4th 2022
I like the recent changes that I made to notes.

a0001z, a0002z, a0003z, a0008z, a0010z updated.

In particular, with a0010z, I was a little bit confused about why my theory of Quantum Gravity Time Dilation was predicting that time would be slower at the particle scale vs at the scale of human experience stretched across the scale of the cells in the human body, but then I remembered that because of the higher velocity of particles the effect of time dilation is reversed in actual effect. Thinking about this helped me fix some of the ideas in note a0010z, a couple of fixes added to note a0008z which was rewritten yesterday, it is surprisingly more interesting to me now than it was for many years, I had disregarded it, but I am fascinated by that note now. Note a0001z has a new 10 point intro for newbies since it sits near the top of the repo most of the time. In note a0002z I took that old poem and really expanded it to make it more interesting, it does not seem destined for the book. a0003z was a really old note from 2012 that contemplated the base level of awareness from an esoteric eastern religious perspective and I updated it to make it more interesting and more in alignment with my current thinking, it does not seem destined for the book.

Some new pages were added to the wiki, but they might be deleted or redone, basically they were search results for certain words, I created them to help myself navigate through the contents of these notes by key words in order to fix certain mistakes that I remembered entering into the notes that I had intended to go back and fix later. There is so much work I wish I had a huge quantity of people such as all the top scientists working for the US Government, perhaps at the NIH, working to helping me fix these notes, fix the sentences, organize the notes by topic, fix the grammar, add math to the physics ideas, identify sentences and ideas that are incorrect, find & link supportive citations, or contradicting research, with people having discussions & debates, teams of people creating graphics or finding illustrations that match certain ideas. There is a lot to do that researcher's across the world could help me with if the Whitehouse wanted to accelerate this research and develop world saving Sentient Robots even faster.

# Update August 3rd 2022
I made some good improvements to notes a0053z & a0008z I created some new maps pages that will soon be integrated into the wiki to help people navigate the repo more easily. There are some new wiki pages, and some changes made to the home wiki or the main table of contents.

# Update August 2nd 2022
Note: A lot of my notes on physics need to be fixed, I wrote contradictory & confusing things. The reasons for that includes the fact that because I broke my arm in September I was for a few months heavily medicated, and also I was still working out some of the ideas. So if you are just checking my notes on physics, the stuff that is incorrect will be fixed soon. Also thanks to feedback from a friend I will be working on creating a Whitepaper next, before work on the book continues.

Regarding the terms evolution vs development.
The consequence of C.O.T. Cellular Oscillating Tomography, is there is no more concept of development apart from evolution, there is only evolution. There is no more artificial that is separate from natural. There is no more man that is separate from nature. There is only nature.

It might be a while until the world realizes OUR collective ~~work~~ evolution over centuries to realize human consciousness & put it into a machine has finally arrived. Once we get started, it won't matter where you work. Be it a coffee shop or at a big tech company like Google you will be rich (economies of scale)

Essentially the tonic oscillation frequency of the oscillating group of cells is the canvas of consciousness, and the changes to it, via the release of 0 1 2 or 3 vesicle sacks at each interval relative to the group oscillation is the paint of the minds internal representations or qualia inside the mind that is perceived by the observer that is the oscillating group of cells

People talk about how gasses become water as emergence, but perhaps a better word concept than emergence is oscillation, like the fireflies, when they synchronize, it looks like emergent behavior, but really its the physics of oscillation.

The oscillation of fireflies and the oscillation of cells points to how all the cells in the body can act as a single sensor, entified through the principles of oscillation, entified in time & space, by passing & dissipating signals between cells until the separate cells are in sync as a single sensor, once in sync every part of your cellular body can sense every other part, because touching one part of your body triggers a wave of signals to pass to all the cells of the body.

This is SelfAwareNeuralNetworks.com, you are in the selfawarenetworks repo on github.com/v5ma and you are reading my notes some of which will go into the Book Self Aware Networks, Neurophysics, Artificial Neurology, and BioSynthetic Interfaces. This is the  page.

These notes, that formulate the ground of the Self Aware Networks Institute, and the book Self Aware Networks, present new theory that ties together new ideas on evolution, gravity, quantum physics, spacetime, cognition, phenomenological consciousness, cells, neural networks, LTD, LTP, dendritic functions, neuron functions, vesicle functions, biological information theory, mass, time, quantum gradient time crystal dilation, and all these new ideas are sync'd together with the physics of oscillation.

# Update: July 30th 2022 18 new points about my past & present work and what these notes contain.
1. I can program Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality accessible websites, I use tools like WebXR, Aframe, and Javascript. I led a project that brought EEG into WebVR (a 3D visualization of brainwave activity signals displayed in a VR headset via the web or a local server) I'm not far off from being able to write novel new code with React Three Fiber either, I've been studying both React and Three.js for a while, I've just been busy writing these notes for my book and for this institute. 

2. I write, speak on topics associated with terms like science, math, biology, neurophysics, virtual reality, artificial neural networks, and brain computer interfaces and I have an upcoming book called Self Aware Networks neurophysics, building sentient AI, and bio-synthetic interfaces. It's the same subject matter as the Self Aware Networks Institute at selfawareneuralnetworks.com or github.com/v5ma (in the selfawarenetworks repo) the institute will later be in WebXR (accessible via AR and VR headset devices or glasses)

3. My theory of brain function is complete enough to build conscious self aware robots, I have enough theory to make a computer have feelings & emotions & have inner qualia experiences. I haven't written the code for this yet but I have the theory needed that can lead to code development. The name of the theory that will allow us to modify existing neural network architectures into sentient architectures is called NAPOT: Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, in these notes it is also referred to as Neural Oscillatory Tomography and Neural Array Projection Tomography. Search for all 3 terms in this github repo to see the notes connected to this theory.

4. I hosted the Neural Lace Podcast (all the content is linked to this repo), a dialog about brain computer interfaces. I've spoke to brilliant neuroscientists, biologists & people in the brain computer interface space.

5. I led the "NeurotechSF" Salon meetup for 2 years, I hosted many code writing meetups, and VR AR meetups. I also run a code oriented discord, three githubs, many science & tech faceobok groups which huge numbers of people as members. I'm a well known brain hacker & journalist. My tweets are seen my hundreds of thousands of people each month.

6. I also created a new gravity theory, quantum gradient time dilation which explains how mass as a time crystal creates the gravitational effect by increasing the surface area of space in a particular direction with additional time dimensions. (I connected this to biology, explaining how neurons are literally warping space.) 
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/c4e94e9fcd049c97d47ef6a5f2f8c29485f5a98d/a0253z.md

7. I combined category theory with Petri nets  for advanced the study of dynamic systems (biology) https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0613z.md

8. I coined the phrase & explained Cellular Oscillation Tomography which is a new theory of evolution https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/7c7397ed87fecd55537b441e650327a6b26a0985/a0011z.md

9. I coined the phrase Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography which explains the inner eye, or the observer inside the brain as entified neural array projections. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/34563a1264edc55836963bf8b49915ff5664ed7b/a0115z.md9. 
 
10. I came up with an explanation for how to decode action potentials comparing them to tensors or polynomials in a Taylor Series (Calculus) https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/42188a5fce0f502ce4497bbea782f9b55c1fb870/a0238z.md
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0365z.md 
 
11. I wrote a theory that explains how with oscillations LTP & LTD work and how that applies to plant growth, Feymen's Path Integral Formulation & more.

https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/06edcce2038853e04c937169161f2dafdf21c8ce/a0101z.md

12. I wrote a theory that explains how memories stored in synapses are Magnified to the whole brain via inhibitory waves. 
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0111z.md

13. I built my own model of a neuron that combines Hodgkin & Huxley with Soliton Wave Theory, with Thermodynamics, and the model explains how the quantity of neurotransmitter release is affected by the magnitude of the action potential via it's duration (calcium channels open longer) which counteracts the notion that an action potential is all or nothing event, otherwise described as synaptic unreliability (an idea that led to the artificial perceptron, a flawed concept which is still used today in modern deep neural networks)

14. I've published novel new ideas on uploading the mind with next gen BCI, decoding the mind, and my thoughts on how to write code that can let a machine feel, experience emotion, and experience internal representations or qualia.  https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/da52fb97714674e66bdec5a61162308b960d99ea/a0645z.md

15. I've described how choice in the human brain works at the interneuron level building on the concept of criterial causation by Peter Tse and combining that with György Buzsáki's work (Rhythms of the Brain) https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0364z.md 
 
16. I applied Buzsáki's work to Steven Strogatz (in the book Sync) work to connect Oscillations brainwaves at EEG scale to phase variation produced oscillations at the neuronal scale & neurotransmitter scale, and unified neural firing with brainwave firing via the hypothesis that magnitude is inverted to frequency at all scales of the universe, including at the scale of individual neuron action potential firing & at the scale of brainwaves from cortical columns or oscillating groups of cells. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0079z.md

17. I put forth a new theory that mitochondria are stimulated by action potentials to release more ATP and I argue that this is a mechanism for reinforcement learning and relative time differences at the individual cell level https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0245z.md

18. There is probably more stuff but I am not thinking of what else I've done at the moment. I will update this later.

# Update July 28th, 2022

# Update July 26th, 2022
A new about info page for the Self Aware Networks Institute https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0361z.md

# Update July 22nd, 2022 New Audio Note
In this new audio note, you can hear me describe how the architecture of sentient & self aware neural networks is different from deep neural networks. I explain how we can precisely develop dog level robots. https://recorder.google.com/df384502-2dd4-420a-9bc1-59f087972fb6

# Update July 19th, 2022 New Wiki:
Work began on converting these notes into a wiki on github.
Looking to pay to have professional transcripts of the audio done by hand.
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/wiki

At the moment the  page consists of a lot of disclaimers and very little about the contents and main ideas presented within these notes. I will work on fixing that for the next major revision of the  file.

# I have several thoughts on Yann LeCun's model released on June 27th 2022 see note a0110z
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0110z.md

# NOTHING IN THIS GITHUB REPO IS EVEN CLOSE TO BEING FINISHED AS OF JUNE 17th 2022
(please let me know if you see something wacky in the audio notes (or in any of the notes), and know that an artificial neural network replaced some of my words in the audio transcription, and that some sentences were spoken by other people, I haven't proofread every line yet. So let me know if you see something that should be deleted or clarified.)

# Update June 23, six days past the 17th.
(still editing & fixing these auto audio transcripts. Fixing these transcripts is a bit more work per hour per day than I realized, ah hmm... and I think I all the notes still need editing at this point. Some more than others. The transcripts might take two months, but the way I am beginning to make connections between documents is threading the book together so this process seems like the right one.)

# June 17th, This github repo "Self Aware Networks" shared to the public for the first time.
