Title: Macroscopic layout of brain a giant sensory processor

# Summary
You propose a model where sensory input (visual, auditory, somatosensory, and gustatory) flows like an "elephant's legs" into the thalamus, hippocampus, and cortex. The neocortex, particularly its outermost sixth layer, processes macroscopic patterns and high-level decisions. You argue that decision-making is deterministic but influenced by predicted futures, with choices driven by the most desirable outcomes. This process integrates comparisons across micro-, meso-, and macro-scale patterns.

You also suggest that our sense of self and spatial awareness is learned, not innate, as demonstrated by experiments involving VR and embodiment, which show how our perception of "self" can adapt to non-local contexts.

Okay so I thought of like an elephant and each of the and each of the elephants feet is one of the incoming senses
right and so the idea is to draw like something some sort of diagram that looks kind of like an
elephant where each of the legs goes to to an eye or an nostril or an ear or an mouth
and to draw like okay so the heart of the elephant so that those are the elephant's legs and the
elephant's legs go up into the the thalamus hippocampus and the enterinal cortex like that look
right but then what goes to the thalamus then goes to the neocortex and the neocortex
so the idea is that the neocortex is
is four sensory cortices that all of the the entire neocortex is
starts out as a sensory cortices from the thalamus from the bottom and then towards the top it's a
it's that's where
where I would say that's where that's that is where macroscopic patterns are studied
in a sense because or or it's weird because
macroscale macroscale macroscale patterns so it's like the really big picture stuff
is studied with that array on the outside the sixth layer of the neocortex but the first layer
is for the incoming senses right so the gussetory is going to come into three prefrontal cortex
and then traditionally traditionally what you call it might call the three sensory
three primary cortices or the somatosensory cortex the visual cortex and the audio cortex
but the the the argument here is that well what's left after you add up the somatosensory cortex
the visual cortex and the auditory cortex is the prefrontal cortex I mean those are like
that's like that's there are pictures of like to fight in the brain up into four major areas
this goes to be the three primary sensory cortices and the prefrontal cortex but the prefrontal cortex
appears to be a sensory cortex appears to be the cortex's smell it appears that the
um gussetory anyway so so long story short is hey maybe that's true maybe it's not the idea
what I'm saying is that the high level decisions come from the whole uh sixth layer not from the
prefrontal cortex or from the whole sixth layer so it's like the top of the brain is making decisions
in different categories and the macroscopic decisions but what I'm saying is like so the
process of decision making though is a mechanical deterministic process and
but you can react to like you do react to to the the different possible the spectrum of possible
futures that you're predicting and um the kind of future that sort of seems like it's the most
plausible uh might be the one that wins out you know it's like well and in that could be that could
be the it's most plausible is the one you like more basically it's another way but the future
that you like the best is probably the one you want to move towards right and so maybe
your actual choice is some like um calculation of where you want to be right with with some sort of
like um with all these like comparisons of microscale macroscale and mesoscale patterns
right so many like things to think through
that i'm for suggesting that that is for human life it's like you know we have this like um
this range of patterns and space is not the concept of spacetime is not so fundamental to our brains
but our brains are are learning this pattern from the world and that's why like you know you see
like this experiment where they will put you put you in a veer headset and then through the veer
headset they'll put you into like a robot and then they'll put the robot like behind you yourself
and so you'll get used to like being the robot that's behind your real self and and these kinds
of experiments sort of like um they kind of show us how the sense of where you are is you know you
can really become a non-local entity
