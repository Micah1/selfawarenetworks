I mentioned that, I spotted an artificial neural network, that looks like it has my criteria for what it takes for a machine to become conscious, and that I think that without this theory they may not have any idea what they have.

(The main idea is that each neural array is a NODE in the 3D neural network of the brain might represent a frame of a video, or the sound in that frame of video, or a feeling in that frame of video, or a taste in that frame of video. So that a neural array, as represented by the exit terminal of neuron that spiked, is rendering one part of one frame of a video in your mind, constructing your reality. One of the ideas is that any combination of neural arrays can join up in the brain's dynamic on the fly freely connecting massively parallel processing architecture to make up a rendered frame of your consciousness mind for one interval of time, and that is perceived by the next array of excited & inhibited neurons)

# "New Map of Meaning in the Brain Changes Ideas About Memory"
(supports the idea that a video frame of consciousness, in one interval of time, is made up of stitched together representations from different areas of the cortex that fired or were inhibited for that interval of time)

I didn't tell which neural network (I apparently didn't save the link in my notes, but that's okay, the one that I saw wasn't exactly right anyways.) the point is that I think that maybe I should make as an as another argument in my book instead of like I was gonna I was thinking of concluding the book on the point that David Eagleman made (in his book Incognito) which is the future of the healthcare system is one that converges with the justice department. I think that was his conclusion right?

00:49
I think I do want to share that conclusion in part. But more importantly I have a conclusion that says, well wait a second we need to put out a theory there that helps researchers understand what they're doing so that we can shape artificial neurology the right way and that means that we can as we create artificial neural networks to replicate the different functions like like right now it's vision or 3D vision.



01:23
3D semantic. Segmentation you can begin to make the machine. Imagine or interpolate or or imagine and do Kansas in the synthesis where it can with interpolation. It's like you have images that you can start with and then you can imagine how they would look if they were different or if they were transformed or you can interpolate the transformation from one image to another and and then create objects that are in between like like something in between a couch and a chair.

01:57
That's interpolation something in between an airplane and an automobile, the interpolation and would be like, all right? Well, you know and now so another character is and between an avocado and a chair and that is interpolation, is also against and synthesis from another. And another way to, to describe it, you're asking AI to create something doesn't already exist.

02:34
So you like, okay well what if that chair was the top of the chair was like, larger, right? Thought what if there's taller and wider and then so why you're talking? Like it's like AI is like understanding the chair and it's original context and it's understanding the words that you're saying and it's looking for chairs that are larger or looking for the concept to large and it's synthesizing a chair.

03:00
Now, with a larger top or this that maybe the top of the, the back is wider and taller. But the, the base of the back is thinner, right? Right for some for artistic reasons, I don't know if that would give you any functional improvement, but to a chair you could try it.

03:18
But I but I think that I don't know that I might do that. My work well for certain climates. If you want to have more airflow on your midsection, but more more comfort on your head. Maybe you have more head positions and but you don't have that many meds Peter in that much area for your events action or maybe you want something that squeezes your midsection like Temple Grandins.

03:53
She was a an artistic or she is an autistic celebrity and she's, but she's an architect. And she, she made a machine that would squeeze her body and it felt really good to her. And so she's she also notice that animals like to like the catalytic move and and circles and so she made a clockwise slaughterhouse that was more successful in.

04:28
Not spooking the cows on my way to

04:35
On the way to their demise. You know with interesting though is I realized that when I was a kid that having a circular path to walk now like I remember there was a science museum when I was a kid and I had all these like special paths like you could tell there was a pattern in the path itself and have these special rooms this so that he followed this special path, that felt magical to follow because like, wow, somebody just made a special path for you to follow, alright?

05:05
And I had nothing to do with the with the room being, I mean, there was something special because so I guess it's, it's the case that there are, you know, in in the study of play cells, they said in the city of Frats that that that we play cells are take one arrangement, they first spherical rooms and and and they have another pattern arrangement for square rooms especially if you give something that's if you give them a room.

05:37
That's that's part square and part sphere like it's a what happens is one or the one of the other of either the square room or the spherical room pattern, manages that room that's in between square and circle. So it's like this so it's like they didn't come up with a squirrel room, right?

06:02
Where a room that's like a pattern arrangement in the place else of a rat that was a third type of room that was in between a square and a sphere. They didn't the right didn't create that new pattern. It just kept the patterns, it had already learned and

06:38
So, we need a guidebook for when artificial elements come.

06:46
And that means,

06:53
We need. So there's creating vision for since there's dance. Synthesizing images or synthesizing. 3D shapes learning 3D shapes. Like, these are parts of what human brain does. And so, you know, some of the, some of the next steps that I've been talked about are making the AI like you have one known network eventually that has that can you can trade on visual data and you can train on audio data.

07:24
You can't turn on different types of data, right? And it automatically sort of like learns, any kind of data that you give it and it managed to hold on to that data somehow and store it. So that it doesn't become lost and it continues to learn from like, so imagine that you learn associations between visual data and audio data, okay?

08:03
And, and in tactile sensation data, right? And that includes tastes and, and oh, fat and olfactory. Olfactory and goosatory, you know, it tastes and smell, so Matt, so that's what humans. So but essentially the computer can be different, right? And so maybe the computer has a system for smelling stuff and a system for hearing stuff.

08:31
And maybe it has, you know, maybe it's seeing stuff with all sorts of wavelengths of light that we don't see. But, but importantly, it was important, is the multimodal comparison because then you're sort of like the then you're sort of getting closer to what human beings do because we do a multi-modal comparison.

08:52
We are human. Beings are comparing the, the arrival time of site signals with the arrival time of sound signals, with the arrival time of speech, signals with the rival time of taste, to travel time of smells and the arrival time of all these coincident patterns basically, across all of our modalities across all of our senses is a part of what makes the human neural network.

09:19
What it is. It's part of what makes it different from from other neural networks. And so there's there's the multi-modal aspect and defunct. I will get there deep learning as it is. Will begin to create multimodal. It are already, it already exists. There's already, you know, people connecting RNAs to CNN's connecting audio information to visual information and human human being.

09:51
So, you know, there's this back propagation. It's like, okay, well what if we could check the the weights against the against the original image, right? What if we get up? What if we could somehow see that what the network learned was not exactly precise to the original? What if we could update the weights?

10:15
Retrospectively to improve the results. Right that the back propagation idea, but the idea is or what, wait, a second. Is there a way for a natural brain to check its own results to check for consistency and in and you know, one way to do that would be to sort of do to take multiple samples like sort of like with with and cross reference them, it's like, okay well I'm gonna attack multiple times and if something is true then it's gonna be true.

10:54
All 100% of the time. And so I'm looking for those moments when something is not true because something something that that is not true. Could look like it's true, right? But that you can spot that it's not true if on one of the times that it seems to be true.

11:21
It turns out that it's not true that if it's like okay well no that's a lie, that's an illusion, someone's creating an illusion, and a lie, and there it and they are and they are masking the truth, right? But if you pay attention, you can you can eventually. If eventually, I in theory, in theory, eventually you might and many may not, you might notice when there, when their truth is, when something seems to be inconsistent about their truth.

11:59
And you might notice when oh suddenly they're truth is is this contradicted or something is not not quite right? And and you would, you would notice this through sort of what I think of as like like neuro array. Tomography conceptual demography. It's like it's like you have all of these.

12:27
It's like your brain constructs reality out of truth. That's established by coincidences and the rivalry. Basically, the arrival times of coincident information that is remembered by the network. So the network is tracking a whole bunch of information but what it notices is the coincident information and what it does, what it would it doesn't what it would have tries hard to not notice or resist is is the is the lesion so there's like threats, there's like this there's these thresholds where for criteria recognition that your brain has where it's going to recognize something, if it's something, but it's not going to recognize something if it's noise.

13:20
So so, so you have to get enough, you don't want to recognize something that it is something you have to get enough of it in order for it to trigger a threshold. And in your mind, your mind, recognize it. Then your mind acknowledges it right? At what point does your mind acknowledge that something is important to you?

13:46
Or or to, or to itself. What point does it does the the mind acknowledge to itself, that's something is important and it's actually what is the self? Exactly. And so I guess I do have to talk about that. I do have to say, well, the self is

14:07
Like a, at the very least, it's a directional concept. The self is like a directional or direct or directional marker to say to say that. This is where something is happening, right? It's like an a sign. Now, you can add things to that, but I'm saying like at the root, just the direction.

14:27
So, like, the, I would say, the macro conceptual context of the mind, because the mind is always seeking new information in a sense because the fundamental process of making connections from coincidence. Patterns is a is, is it's like seeking to know. It's like the the fundamental mechanism of the brain is it is is in in ingrained in the actual machinery in the engineering.

15:08
Is this process? It's a process. I'm just finding one process in this. This machine, not the whole machine, but the one process in the machine is always seeking to know, it's always seeking to know is perceiving perception. And we say it's a seeking to know because there's an action being performed by the, by the, by the metaphorical gears of the brain, and by the, by the literal neurons of the brain, there's a, there's a mechanism being performed by the actual neural networks of the brain.

15:41
That is, it's not a metaphor. It's there's an actual mechanism, an actual physical process that's being performed so that the brain is seeking new information. And, and, and so that means that basically, everyone is observing on everyone else, everyone's a spot. Now whether what whether you know, it's, it's a question of like, okay, well, who were they passing information on to?



16:57
These people who, I who, I'm, I've met, and I'm in there listening to me. And and so there's this sort of like ongoing curiosity So let me get back to shaping artificial shaping, the mind what we've got to not only like be able to look at existing around networks to understand what they're doing specifically and a context of intelligence.

17:29
But also to understand when networks come conscious, we need to know when networks become conscious. Because if the storms on Jupiter, if any of them were actually conscious, we would need to know that and essence because that's like that's now a life form that might be. You might consider this life home to be like an endangered species or even, even a potentially like an environmental threat if you visited that planet.

18:03
But you also have to consider the ethics of your relationship to that species. And you need to understand how intelligent. Is it how capable of is it of coordinating? Its own behaviors, right? You have to be able to identify if that species is likely to become conscious and you need to kind of understand if anything that you're doing, could could be of a risk to that species.

18:40
Like what? If what if shooting a moon into that into that cloud. I'm not shooting. I'm going to shooting a satellite, what a sending satellite and it explores satellite probe into that storm on Jupiter that's conscious. What is that is like putting a bullet in in someone's heart and and that somehow that disrupted that dissipative system enough to eventually lead to, it's dissolution down the road like the butterfly effect.

19:12
It could be enormous that storm, that conscious storm theoretical conscious storm on Jupiter, could be enormously sensitive. And so sending any kind of probes from earth could be, you know, either lethal or, you know, at worst or or, you know, unethical at best if you don't know what you're doing, like, you should know, at least what you're doing.

19:39
And, and so, I think there has to be some consideration of, of the criteria of what makes for a conscious entity. And also for the reasons in terms of like, you know, that ethic, you know, ethics towards our fellow human beings for example, but also ethics towards animals, right?

20:05

21:45
And so, you might, you might

22:28
And so you have as you have this conflict for you say, okay. Well the one culture is in a conflict with the other culture because they don't want their culture to be diluted in transformed and taken over by what they see is a weaker culture that delivers weaker results, right?

22:44
And so they so there are so to some extent yet, like the argument is that I'm making the argument that I'm making. Is that on the one hand? There, there aren't really genetic differences between people's but there are cultural differences between people's and those cultural differences can result in the appearance of, like, when cultures are being disrupted with other cultures and they're blending with other cultures, like you can see moments.

28:39
It's like a lot of different oscillators coming together to make them result in the result is that things happen. Much faster because this patterns are because patterns spread they trickle outwards.


29:54
What point, you know, we need to be able to identify the cities about to become a conscious entity before it becomes are conscious energy So that we're able to understand our relationship then to a conscious city and the ethical implications that we now have towards this entity, that it's a conscious city.

30:19

Now, now you might have name. I have some objections from some people about they're being a person that is the city because because you don't because you like, okay, well, so now the city is Cheryl and so Cheryl it is is everywhere and that's a problem that might be a problem for you because you don't want Cheryl to always be up in your business.



31:58
We need to understand what the brain is, what would consciousness is within the brain, so that we're not accidentally building tortured entities, all right? So that we're not actually, like imagine like someone managed, some alien species arrives with, you know, they've got warp 10 drives, right? The 10th 10th iteration of work, 10 of work technology, it's baseboard, we did no right.

32:26
So they really arrived and they can travel through time with space and so someday. And so they someday they just like appear inside the earth or I don't know like maybe they maybe they can travel without traveling, right? So maybe they're just like teleporting from one planet to or another, the planet teleporters.

32:47
We like the man to start track is like, yeah, we used to teleport. I mean, we used to travel and start ships but then we realized we could teleport everywhere and universe from planting planet directly.

33:04
And so, we brought all of these animals to planet earth from different planets.

33:14
When we brought them all here from these different planets on this tetrahedron camera, which opens a port? It opens a portal to other planets is to start gate.

33:52
So yeah, I think about that.
