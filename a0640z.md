Mesoscale to Macroscale: The Fractal of Isomorphic Functions: Hand, Eye, Neuron

Global Structure Macro to Micro
Fractal Global Structure
* fractals (princeton mri study, eeg, meg, cavities (skull, eyes, ear), sensory arrays (dendrites, circuits, columns, default networks, thalamic bridges, interneurons, corpus callosum, rich clubs, major brain network junctions.)
    * fractals eeg
    * fractals meg
    * fractals mri
    * fractals anatomy
    * fractals functional anatomy
    * I want to show how the collection of data in arrays is similar across the eyes, ears, tongue, touch, and smell, and how oscillations are arrays also.
* Neural communication modalities
