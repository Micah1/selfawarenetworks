The Scope of this project
Parkinson's & Other Brain Diseases
With Parkinson’s Disease, Alzheimers Disease, and Cells Timing is everything.

Timing is everything, when it comes to the brain, the body, cells, space, Timing either grows connections or unravels connections between cells, the timing of the firing of receptors determines what functions or behaviors are unlocked from that cell, the timing of the firing of cells determines your perception of reality, what you perceive, and what your choices are going to be.

“(...) once you understand what a single neuron is doing everything else is just sort of emergent from that (...)” Subutai Ahmad from “Tutorial and Discussion on Cortical Column Voting Mechanisms Developed by Numenta - 5 April, 2022” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ0k6Vg8wto

In 2 years

I want to help outline both existing research as well as a proposal to use neural networks & medical imaging to completely understand all brain diseases like Parkinson’s Disease & others and identify novel new treatments.

The point of this chat is to invite others to share their knowledge of Parkinson’s Disease & other brain diseases such as Amnesia, Dementia, Cancer, Alzheimer’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease & More.
