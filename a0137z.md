(oscillat, field, synap) Oscillator level awareness
(Created Jul 12, 2021, 11:10 PM)
Lets imagine that individual phasic firing and or inhibited neurons are pushing and pulling on the group oscillator, usually the group oscillator pulls phasic firing neurons back into phase alignment with the oscillator, but past a certain threshold if the quantity of phasic firing or inhibited firing changes the electrical gradient of the oscillating neural circuit past a threshold then its phase will be reset which means the neuronal ensemble adjust the phases of all their neurons simulteously. That means that neural circuits can track, be aware of, and respond to, speak back to other neural circuits, using the same principles of dendritic firing but now at the neuronal ensemble scale. So the collective energy pulse produced by neuronal ensembles can also be felt by other neuronal ensembles.

This allows for a model of neuronal ensembles or oscillators to as a group be aware of neural firing, (connected via long interneurons between pyramidal cells and other pathways) ensemble firing, and perhaps dendritic and synaptic scale firing

I'm imagining a brain that is all aware of itself, absolutely everything that one senses and perceives is represented by their brain in some place, but with different oscillators, represented by different power bands, with location invariant patterns, with cross brain interneuron enabled synchronicity, neuronal emsembles can increase in their firing rate become more noticeable yet weaker, decrease in their firing rate, becoming less noticable but more powerful. So attention can shift to large brain areas that have more new activity & are more excited, meaning when you become excited some of your senses will have their receptive fields become more aware, which implies a slower oscillatory rate.
