(cortex, amplitude)
organization
This has many micro cycles from the main cycle, and the microcycles are divided by mesocycles meso cycles, so there are two scales of patterns for the macro cycles. Or maybe the scale of the pattern is more like the alpha band of the delta band,

right like maybe the slow frequency but higher amplitude delta is better at binding high level patterns at the top of the cortex that need to move slower in part because
