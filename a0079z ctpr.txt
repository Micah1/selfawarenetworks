(oscillat) Led connected to eyeball
Imagine an eyeball with an LED
imagine two eyeballs each one lighting up and LED of a different color

Imagine ten eyeballs stacked vertically and each one of them is looking at a row of LEDs that is produced by each one of them.

Now imagine that some of the LEDs are bright, brighter, brightest, some are dark, some are dull, and they exist in all colors.

but now imagine a larger set of eyeballs that is watching the rows of LEDs produced by other neurons, with each eyeball in the next set having an axon terminal from each of the previous sets wired to them

so they are able to notice phase differentials 
which is how we can have solid precise pattern recognition on what is otherwise a very fluid brain with virtualized patterns

so the larger eyes are watching patterns from previous sets of neurons

but the knowledge is played back in sequences, so knowledge appears partially in one area of the brain, then partially in another, then partially in another, and consciousness only exists in time over 4 dimensions, 1 dimension of time and 3 dimensions of space.

It's a self-aware network in 4 dimensions rendering a 4 dimensional pattern to itself that is reactive to the world and able to make prediction-based models of reality with sparse spatially & temporally distributed frequency/phase patterns that represent coicident neural firing or coincident neural inhibition deviating from the oscillatory norm of a given oscillator on some level as observed by the neurons in the oscillator, and by oscillators or circuits or cortical columns linked across the brain thanks to the activity of interneurons and major intersections of traffic such as the thalamic bridges, the corpus callosum, the tempo-parietal junction, Werneck & Broca's areas and other areas of the brain that are highly connected or connecting multiple regions of the brain together.
