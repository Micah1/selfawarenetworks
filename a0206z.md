# self

When it comes to who you are, in the context of neuroscience, I think György Buzsáki is correct that people are not born as blank slates, the human body has natural preferences. I agree with Yann LeCun that humans have specialized intelligence not general intelligence.

Yet looking at the story of Phineas Gage or reading Oliver Sacks & Michael Gazzaniga's work on Split Brain Patients you know that personalities do change. You may not be able to change yourself with willpower as that's a paradox, but that doesn't mean you won't change over time.

# self as a phase field

Per the realizations I have since publishing my notes on the neurophysics of consciousness I think of myself as like a cube of oscillating brainwave patterns, or a volumetric phasefield, I think of others as like cube shaped volumetric phasefields also. Our bodies just carry it.

The cube shape is not essential to my imagination but it helps clarify that it a 3D dimensional stack of phase changes happening in the brain exist temporarily and spatially to model reality in the brains natural 3D graph, via the neocortex & the hippocampal-entorhinal loop with all the brain's network connections including the thalamic pathways.

Our brainwaves are maintaining this 3D rendered phase field that represents our expectations for the movements of entities in our sensory awareness. The phase field, including the light field, represents our decoded and tomographically constructed 3D simulation of reality, the world, other people, our environment, and ourselves.

The different models that we have help the organism to plan its actions, actions that accomplish the maintainance of it's own equilibrum and the equilibrium/stability of it's environment.

# space as a phase field

I muse that space is expanding & contracting in this moment within it's ever present now moment. the expansion & contraction of spacetime are the forward & backward movements of relative time within an every present now time that no space relative to the time that is space sort of eternally folding on itself in giant loops.

In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and non-existence is the unfrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens, it is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz)

# space as a fractal neural network

Space time is the eternal golden braid, and spacetime could be thought of the fractal of a network, but without the time-frequency characteristics that exist for human scale (magnitude & frequency of information patterns) that define conscious data, vs unconscious data.  
Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid 

The earths time dilation field, responding to the earth's mass, moves very slowly from a human perspective, but in a sense its ripping space apart as earth moves through it, disporting space as it moves through space

# the morphologhy of the dendrite as a stored memory that conditionally activates

The synaptic dendrite is changing into new memories when it changes shape through ltd and ltp. The changes however invariably are going to preserve some remnant or trace of the previously learned memories, lots of tiny structural changes on short time scales result in long histories over long periods of time. The aging morphology of dendrites will encode the traces of past memories even when new memories replace old memories.

I am the phase field, emitted by exit terminal, that becomes encoded inhibitory neurons that create the oscillating tonic brainwave patterns that unify cell assemblies to recurrent waves of expectation.

There is not necessarily anyone who is actually there in your head, there could be in theory, but the point I am making is that the observer, or the existence of the observe that says "I think therefore I am" or "Cognito Ergo Sum" could be just implied, without there actually being an obverser. It could be just an observation, and it could be just the observation of an observation.

# to be or not to be (a self) that is the question

Whether there is actually an observer or not is perhaps a question for the Buddha to answer, and actually I think he passed on answering that question definitely. So maybe it's up to the observer?

Neural Array Oscillating Projection Tomography

I am a phase field, the observer is just implied, there is no self. Or maybe there is a self, but how do you know the difference between an implied self (because there is an observation) and an actual self (an actual entity that is separate from the observation) or perhaps you want to argue that the self is the observation? or that it's just part of the observation?

The phase pattern of the mind is a 3D grid pattern, a pattern defined by frequencies with varying durations (magnitudes) in a 3D grid of cells (your brain)

So we can really say materially that the mind consists of information encoded in brainwaves & brain activity. It's a valid statement.

# the mind as a virtual self

Our minds are virtualized substrate invariant information patterns, meaning that we are software, and while the human brain tissue is the only known home of minds like ours today it will not be the only home for our minds in the future. We are on track to being able to download copies of our minds into computer systems, to create backups of ourselves, to put our minds into robot bodies.

The memory that comes around comes around again if you want it. If you forget a cool memory, know that your memories oscillate and you might remember it again if you wait for it, and you might construct it into an even more awesome idea down the road.

Can we say that space time is magnitude is inversely proportional to frequency 
What was that equation?
2 pi r squared? look up how to calculate gravity

# trying to plot the per atom strength of gravity as the time dilation effect,
(then trying to consider how to multiply the time dilation effect when the density of atoms in a given volume increases)

It was the Inverse Square of Radius
So we need to use the Inverse Square of Radius to calculate the precise time dilation effect of an atom, to understand how one atom is changing the time dilation for a given area

but then we need to quantify how the density of atoms in some volume of space corresponds to magnitude of time dilation from a given mass.

# memory development without spiking

I realized that since AP wave duration is changed by the amount of potassium
that regular tonic oscillations will also affect the duration of the Action Potential Magnitude, during normal tonic oscillation, increasing or decreasing the changes of a phasic pulse from that group.

This potassium effect is a meso-scale effect to study at the cell assembly level or neural oscillating group level, or cortical column level or at larger scales, the effects might be very small at the individual neuron scale and hard to judge.

The effect glial cells have may include playing a role in increasing/decreasing ion gradients in addition to their role in channel configuration, and glial cell interaction is going to be part of changes to your tonic thinking patterns, so when caffiene, alchohol, or other drugs affect your thinking, the blood vessels, the glial cells, and the ion gradients, and the neurotransmitter production will all play a role in how your thinking shifts.

but since the releases come in 0, 1, 2, 3 vesicles that might be how the tonic phase is just 1

the tonic or periodic is going to reflect an interval of conscious awareness that contains empty expectation, it has no meaning but simply expects the same pattern as last time to happen again eventually and it reflects surprise physically when it doesn't (inhibited) happen, or when it does

so they way ap syn fires it sets the expectation rate for the inhibited neurons

so you have an escillating expection in the hibited neurons

so the ap spike is the memory, the inhibited set expect, and display their expectation

the way tonic firing is changed by action potentials in excitatory firing is both like a photo taken of light and it sets an oscillating expectation timer for the same event happen again

# tonic brainwaves explained as the reason we see Tetris blocks with our eyes closed after playing the game Tetris for 5 hours.
this is why after playing Tetris for 5 hours you close your eyes and see tetris blocks in your eyelids, those are oscillating set expectations in your tonic wave patterns set by the action potentials that fired when you were playing tetris but optimizing your brain for that task the more you kept at it

the process of continually changing potassium levels that can release tonic firing also explains how tonic firing neurons can kick up phasic brain patterns now and then that are reflective of something you have been thinking about for a while

because multiple tonic oscillations are exerting the effects of collective information consideration on each other with each interval pf tonic firing

so your non activated thinking continues to oscillate at tonic frequencies as the oscillations consolidate the amount of potassium moves towards equilibrium overall or locally in places away from equilibrium (the brain has been described as a chaotic oscillator) 

so even in a sensory deprivation tank your tonic waves imprinted with memories stretching back waves months years and decades continue to quietly oscillate kicking up new memories now and then as the work between two different oscillating arrays sometimes triggers enough potassium to create a phasic or high phasic spike

The activity of glial cells, in addition to assisting with LTP & LTD functions (via facilitating or eliminating synaptic relationships between neurons) 

my new idea is that glial cells could be involved inredistributing the production of sodium / and or potassium channels and the configurations of those channels, as well as increase or decrease ion gradients that shift the

# Choices

I think decision making is fundamentally two things: 1 it's a bottom up threshold reaching process in the receptors & bodies of ALL cells, with the receptor configuration representing LTP. To confine decision making to simply a region of the brain like the PFC is bad science.

But what drives our choices is also 
2. a top down process from the memories stored in our tonic brainwave patterns that are attractors driving our the completion of our past learned expectations so that our choices appear to have a logical continuity over long periods of time. That's why you do not impulsively respond to every advertisement.

My question to you is "Are you sure there is a self and that the existence of an observer isn't just implied by the rendered perspective in the phase field that represents reality in the mind of the organism?" 

# Institute (add to read me)

I once considered calling the Self Aware Networks Institute for Qualia Research, The Neurophysics of Consciousness, Artificial Neurology, and Bio Synthetic Interfacing.

I can lose conscious track of the room while unconsciously keeping track of the room (especially parts of the room I am not facing) because tonic oscillating patterns maintain the shape, concept, features of the room in my unconscious expectations, they are just waiting for sensory updates to update those oscillatory patterns.
