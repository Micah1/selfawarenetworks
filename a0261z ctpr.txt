(oscillat, cortex) When I said I felt like I have had a kundalini awakening through pain I meant that in a literal sense I senses my own mind as a vast infinite lake with pain rippling across the surface of this self-aware lake.

lets say that virtual thought patterns change shape and scale in their delta from being something that many areas of the brain are sensing/receiving simultaneously

so you can have a computer mouse in your peripheral vision and that would be represented by small brainwave signals that are updating the position, orientation, color and other properties of the mouse in each second

but if you looked at the mouse directly, really stared at it, leaning in close so that its much closer to your face, a much larger part of your field of view, then you touched the mouse while looking at it this way, well I am going to expect an increase in the delta of phasic neural firing patterns in the visual and somatosensory areas of your brain, if you click the mouse then the audible click is now activating the audio cortex of your brain, and your attention / awareness of the mouse should be correllated with increases in phasic firing in 3 associated primary sensory cortical areas.

Whatever you are attending to ought to have an increase in the spatial and or temporal patterns evoked by that pattern,

the neural correlates of focus and attention

but the slow rate dipole oscillations of EEG would not give you this 240hz Phasic Firing Pattern, nor would it give you the image resolution of a single neuron firing.
