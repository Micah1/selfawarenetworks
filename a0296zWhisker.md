# "Rapid Arrival and Integration of Ascending Sensory Information in Layer 1 Nonpyramidal Neurons and Tuft Dendrites of Layer 5 Pyramidal Neurons of the Neocortex" 
"Remarkably, the latency for primary whisker-evoked responses is as short as ∼5-7 msec in layer 1 neurons and tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. In addition, the latency for primary whisker-evoked responses in tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons is ∼1 msec shorter than that in somata. These results indicate that ascending sensory inputs arrive in layers 1 and 4 concurrently, which provides a neural mechanism for rapid integration and coincident detection of salient sensory information."
"However, this dendritic coincident detection mechanism requires the concurrent arrival of sensory inputs in layers 1 and 4 which is contradictory to the customary view that sensory inputs to layer 1 are relayed primarily by the secondary sensory ascending system, in which neurons respond to tactile stimuli and convey information sluggishly"

The fact that the thalamus routes information to multiple layers simultaneously is explained with the need for multi-layer dendritic coincidence detection (dendrites have a leaky membrane, so signals have to arrive within a short time window, or all at once, to trigger the cell to fire)

# "Long-Range Neuronal Circuits Underlying the Interaction between Sensory and Motor Cortex" 

"These interactions between sensory and motor systems are crucial for haptic perception (Diamond et al., 2008, Gibson, 1962, Wolpert et al., 1995). Sensorimotor integration in whisker-based somatosensation is mediated by brain structures that form a series of nested loops, at the levels of the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral cortex (Diamond et al., 2008, Kleinfeld et al., 1999). Little is known about the cellular architecture of these different loops."

# "Spatiotemporal properties of whisker-evoked tactile responses in the mouse secondary somatosensory cortex"
"However, upon vibrissal stimulation, tactile information first reaches S1 but also, almost simultaneously, the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). To further understand the role of S2 in the processing of whisker inputs, it is essential to characterize the spatio-temporal properties of whisker-evoked response dynamics in this area"

My hypothesis is that the thalamus is sending almost identical information to multiple layers of cortex simultaneously so that the Layer 5 neuron which spans the cortical column can parse out coincidences in the data, which help to create a tomography map of reality, which becomes a rendering that is oscillated in a looping fashion that is also tomographically mapped & rendered by the brain continously.
