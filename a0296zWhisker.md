Whiskers

Regarding the article below (Internal Brain State...): 1. The following reference points to top down control. 2. A process of how this can work is described in note a0007z.loop as 6th layer pyramidal neuron tuning. When signals are sent from the 6th layer pyramidal neuron to through the thalamic loop back down to the somas of pyramidal cells in the 2nd & 3rd layers those Somas are excited and the signal to noise ratio lowers so the cells become more sensitive. The reverse situation could happen if inhibitory interneurons cells inhibit incoming signals, reducing the sensitive or changing to signal to noise ratio. It's interesting because regular whisking desynchronizes the lfp and eeg, and that is what sensor input is supposed to do, in Self Aware Networks NAPOT theory, it's up to the tonic oscillation to absorb decohering sensory inputs, to noise them away, into a synchronized pattern again. The decohering distinctions of which are the phase wave differentials that define the rendering of qualia, that is the abstraction of whisker feeling as the mouse knows it, it's rendered in the decoherence pattern.

# "Internal brain state regulates membrane potential synchrony in barrel cortex of behaving mice"
" However, when the mouse is whisking, an internally generated state change reduces the Vm correlation, resulting in a desynchronized local field potential and electroencephalogram. Action potential activity was sparse during both quiet wakefulness and active whisking. Single action potentials were driven by a large, brief and specific excitatory input that was not present in the Vm of neighbouring cells. Action potential initiation occurs with a higher signal-to-noise ratio during active whisking than during quiet periods. Therefore, we show that an internal brain state dynamically regulates cortical membrane potential synchrony during behaviour and defines different modes of cortical processing."

# "Rapid Arrival and Integration of Ascending Sensory Information in Layer 1 Nonpyramidal Neurons and Tuft Dendrites of Layer 5 Pyramidal Neurons of the Neocortex" 
"Remarkably, the latency for primary whisker-evoked responses is as short as ∼5-7 msec in layer 1 neurons and tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. In addition, the latency for primary whisker-evoked responses in tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons is ∼1 msec shorter than that in somata. These results indicate that ascending sensory inputs arrive in layers 1 and 4 concurrently, which provides a neural mechanism for rapid integration and coincident detection of salient sensory information."
"However, this dendritic coincident detection mechanism requires the concurrent arrival of sensory inputs in layers 1 and 4 which is contradictory to the customary view that sensory inputs to layer 1 are relayed primarily by the secondary sensory ascending system, in which neurons respond to tactile stimuli and convey information sluggishly"

The fact that the thalamus routes information to multiple layers simultaneously is explained with the need for multi-layer dendritic coincidence detection (dendrites have a leaky membrane, so signals have to arrive within a short time window, or all at once, to trigger the cell to fire)

# "Long-Range Neuronal Circuits Underlying the Interaction between Sensory and Motor Cortex" 

"These interactions between sensory and motor systems are crucial for haptic perception (Diamond et al., 2008, Gibson, 1962, Wolpert et al., 1995). Sensorimotor integration in whisker-based somatosensation is mediated by brain structures that form a series of nested loops, at the levels of the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral cortex (Diamond et al., 2008, Kleinfeld et al., 1999). Little is known about the cellular architecture of these different loops."

# "Spatiotemporal properties of whisker-evoked tactile responses in the mouse secondary somatosensory cortex"
"However, upon vibrissal stimulation, tactile information first reaches S1 but also, almost simultaneously, the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). To further understand the role of S2 in the processing of whisker inputs, it is essential to characterize the spatio-temporal properties of whisker-evoked response dynamics in this area"

My hypothesis is that the thalamus is sending almost identical information to multiple layers of cortex simultaneously so that the Layer 5 neuron which spans the cortical column can parse out coincidences in the data, which help to create a tomography map of reality, which becomes a rendering that is oscillated in a looping fashion that is also tomographically mapped & rendered by the brain continously.
