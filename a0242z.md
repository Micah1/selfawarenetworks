Oscillation

On the other hand the soliton mechanical wave / as an em acoustical wave at the synapse may send memory representations down in the microtube, a sound traveling across an electromagnetic membrane, and sucked into the vortex of the microtubule where it collides with past memory formations from previous signals and adds its own signal to the history, like a new transaction on the blockchain, but more like Orch OR theory.

I think that the synapses playing a tune to Orch Or would create memory sequencies stored in a chronological order from one end of the microtubule to another. I imagine pattern formation starts at the far end, going with my previous idea that memories are attractors in an oscillation component, their activity might be driving behavior when they react to incoming patterns by sending back reverbations from that same channel like a reflecter that modulates a signal by its learned memory, this reaction might cause a synaptic change event, including the loss of a synapse, the creation of a new synapse, an inhibitory state (0) for the synapse, a tonic state(1,), or a phasic firing state (2,3) which might set the decay rate of an LTD signal to its exit terminal.

I think that each one of us is like the creator of his or her own universe, and we are meeting as different people because god was bored of being just a single solo entity, like the first atom that randomly emerged from spacetime oscillations between having a location and having a velocity.

In one sense we can change anything about ourselves, but it is our memories of the past, combined with the data of the present that generates predictions of the future that we can remember transmit magnify and display in our oscillating minds.

it turns out that when a synapse is activated it does not only accept neurotransmitters, it also accept ATP, the energy currency of cells that D-ribose helps make, more ATP in the body means more excited neurons I think, this also may explain why taking a vitamin b12 supplement might make you feel mentally and physically more awake for a while, and even accelerate your heart a little, your cells are more excited.
