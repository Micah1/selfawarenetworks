Understanding How Our Brains Make Choices and Generate Thoughts

Our brains are constantly generating ideas—some beneficial and others not so much. Take, for example, an angry teenager who might consider breaking a window. This thought arises because, within their range of experiences, such an action seems possible or even common among peers. However, upon reflection, they might recognize the significant social, legal, and personal consequences of acting on this impulse. They may realize that such an action could harm their reputation and future prospects within their community.

Instead of engaging in destructive behavior, the teenager might choose a more constructive activity, like washing a car. This alternative not only avoids negative repercussions but also contributes positively to their image as a helpful and kind person. The key here is the ability to connect immediate impulses with long-term outcomes—a process that can be disrupted by factors like brain lesions or altered states due to drugs. When this connection is impaired, the wisdom that usually guides better decision-making may not come into play, leading to regrettable actions.

But why do such negative or impulsive thoughts occur in the first place? Our thought processes aren't entirely random; they're shaped by our life experiences and learned patterns. While we might sometimes generate "stupid" ideas, these thoughts are often the result of not considering all important perspectives. For instance, someone might inadvertently cause an accident—like a person on an electric unicycle changing lanes without looking, leading to a collision with an electric skateboarder. This isn't necessarily malicious but could stem from a lack of awareness, highlighting how incomplete consideration can lead to unintended consequences.

As we age, the scope of our imaginations tends to narrow based on what we perceive as plausible. A six-year-old might dream of jumping from Mars to Saturn, but by the time we're in our twenties or older, such fantasies often give way to more realistic considerations. This shift doesn't eliminate creativity but focuses it within the bounds of our accumulated knowledge and experience.

The generation of thoughts is more procedural than random. Our brains create new possibilities based on patterns we've learned over time. These thoughts, whether good or bad, surface and undergo a deliberation process where we decide to act on them, discard them, or refine them. This process involves oscillating neural patterns that represent learned sequences.

Neuroscientist Grace Lindsay, in her book Models of the Mind, explains that neurons primarily respond to changes. If there's no change, neural activity remains constant. This means our brains are essentially tracking differences over time. These changes are encoded in phase patterns within cortical columns, where sequences are learned using individual neurons. The encoding is virtual; if one neuron doesn't fire, another can represent the activity because the group functions cohesively—much like a swarm of fireflies.

This concept relates to Hebbian learning, often summarized as "neurons that fire together wire together." However, it's more accurate to say that neurons fire in close sequence, not necessarily simultaneously. Peter Tass, a professor at Princeton University and author of The Neurobiology of You, emphasizes that neurons strengthen their connections when they fire within milliseconds of each other.

An illustrative analogy is how fireflies synchronize their flashing. Individually, they react to stimuli, but collectively, they create a unified pattern through oscillatory activity. This group behavior can be seen as a form of "wireless consciousness" that grows in complexity with increased feedback. Similarly, groups of neurons in our brains work together to represent complex thoughts and ideas.

Understanding how our brains generate and process thoughts helps us recognize why certain ideas arise and how we choose to act on them. By reflecting on the broader impact of our actions and seeking wisdom daily, we can make decisions that lead to better outcomes for ourselves and those around us.

Original Whisper Transcription:
So, let's talk about choices and how your brain is making choices.
So I'm thinking about the possibility of certain kinds of certain categories of thoughts
of the parent. So you have ideas, like you might have an idea to, I mean if you're an angry teenager,
you might have a random idea to break a window. That could happen, but because for you it seems like
that's inside a range of possibilities. I mean because it depends on your life experience,
whether other teenagers do those kinds of things or not, maybe I'm not sure. But for someone out
there, they could have a violent fantasy of something that they imagine they could do,
and then they decide, oh you know that sounds, it seems pretty stupid because the social consequences,
the legal consequences, the civil consequences, those are all pretty high. So maybe they think
about that idea that was generated. And they say, well if I compare this to my whole pattern of my
predictions for the future and my predictions for what kind of image I want to create for myself
in the community, maybe this is a trashy idea. Even if I could get away with it, maybe it's an
idea that might bother me for a long time and I did something like that. Anyway, so the point is
like if you have some, say that's a non-random but sort of an idea that is kind of a mistake for
you to be making, like when you could be doing something that actually makes you happier,
which could be like washing your car versus breaking a window. Those are two different sort
of results you're going to get from those two different kinds of activities, right? One of them,
you might be happy you're washing a car than breaking a window, right? That might be a,
there might be happier outcomes from the potential reputation of being a helpful person versus
being a destructive person, right? Or a kind person versus a violent person. And anyway,
so this is like, well, maybe the part of your brain that sort of like helps you to connect the
dots to your bigger picture is disrupted because of a cancerous legion or something.
Or maybe drugs and even altered brain state. And so that the wisdom perspective doesn't make it
to the top and you end up doing something stupid that you've regretted. But that's sort of like,
yeah, well, if you can stop and think about it, the big picture and seek wisdom every day,
then maybe you'll avoid making disastrous choices. But the part about like, okay,
so why are they occurring in the first place? Why are you getting, why do people,
why does anyone get stupid ideas? Or ideas? Or maybe you have positive intentions,
but you have a stupid idea because it's, because you're not like considering another
important perspective. Like I saw someone on an electric unicycle, it was video. I saw a video
of someone and they changed lanes in front of someone on an electric skateboarder and the
electric skateboarder was moving fast and the unicycle wasn't looking where they were turning
and the only what happened was a collision where the electric unicycle rider smashed into the back
of the person on the electric unicycle. And at first, the video was suggesting that this was
a malicious person on an electric skateboard. But we watched, but I watched the video several
times and I read the comments and other people had the same idea that actually this was probably
an innocent collision that the person on the electric unicycle caused because they just moved
themselves into the path of an oncoming vehicle without looking. Right? And like you can tell
from the video, this person changed lanes and they weren't aware of the surroundings. It's hard
to imagine someone would do, either either one of them would do that on purpose because they
both spent spinning and possibly hitting the ground very hard and possibly becoming injured
at that point. We didn't see past the broken video to see whether those people were okay. They may
have broken arms and legs and or gotten sprains or anchors. It's it's really like having gone
through an accident myself. It's just really sort of unsettling for their sake. I mean,
I like I enjoy riding the electric unicycle still even after I had an accident. But because it is
because it is very close to the risk of if you're driving at the same speed as a bicycle,
the risk is about the same. If you go faster than a bicycle, which is capable, they can go up to
34 miles an hour. But I mean, I usually stay under under 15. I think I think I've changed the
setting so that beeps at me at 16 miles an hour. And so I don't really ever go faster than 16.
But if I did, you know, then the safety rating is more like
a motor cross bicycle. So I'm talking about electric an electric powered bike that is
faster than a bicycle that doesn't have an electric motor. So we're talking 34 miles an hour. Now
people people think well, because the bicycle has two wheels or something. They say there's
something else that gives you some sort of I don't see what I don't see you like. Realistically,
I don't think the bicycle is giving you any more protection, not if you're running at the same,
same speeds. There's nothing there's no airbag on a bicycle. Right. People think oh,
we've got two wheels. So it's safer. No, not really. If you if anything hits you when you're
on a bicycle, most of your body is exposed. If you if you hit a bump and fly off the bicycle,
your body is exposed. If you hit another person, your body is exposed. There's nothing really
on a bicycle that's going to protect you in a collision or an accident. I've wiped out I've
come down a steep I came down and people that people it's seen it does like people ride bicycles
safely for years. But there are a lot of bicycle accidents where cars hit bicycles. This is
actually a known fact. And in San Francisco, for example, a lot of bicyclists have been killed
by cars. It's so ordinary that cops don't investigate it for murder. Like, like that is
not like that is an easy way to take somebody out. They wouldn't even if they were like,
uh, we're not going to not unless you like doing more than once. And this is I guess this is this
this is a joke, but it's probably true. I mean, probably.
So what is going on here?
So, um, yeah, so the bicycle situation.
So I just want to add, like, okay, so I don't think that the stupid thoughts if you're thinking
about harming someone else. That's a stupid thought. Because there's always a better strategy,
right? But it's like, okay, why are you have why do stupid thoughts happen?
And say it was kind of something that's kind of like a random generation of thoughts, right? Maybe
you hurt yourself, you get angry and you create an angry thought and, you know, whatever.
But it's not the point of the point I wanted to make and record it is not exactly random. Like,
you don't have like, you're not having random thoughts about, you know, what you're going to do
when you're on the planet Mars and you want to jump over to the planet Saturn. And like you
think that, well, maybe I should just, you know, grab my spaceship. I mean, your thoughts are not
that random. So maybe if you're six years old, there was also that random. But at the point that
you're, you know, 40 years old or whatever, or 30 or 20, you're not like having, yeah, maybe just
at by the age of 20, you're not really having fantasies anymore about about being about what
you're going to do if you're on in a spaceship. Right? This is not it's not for you at age 20.
It may not be that possible anymore. I know at some 20, some 20 year olds, maybe maybe it is
possible for them. But let's just say, you know, when you get older, the number of things that
seem plausible to you is perhaps for the things that could happen. I think they start to shrink,
they start to narrow. It's like, what is a plausible future for you? And they start to narrow.
Now, maybe, maybe there is some reality to it. If you're young enough, it actually is plausible
that someday you may have to make a decision about what you're going to do on a spaceship. And maybe
you'll have, you know, kinds of some kind of propulsion technologies that we haven't even
dreamt of yet that can get you from Mars to any other planet really quickly. That's an interesting
idea. I mean, obviously, there's, you know, Star Trek and teleportation and warp drive. And, you
know, so human is already dreamt of a lot faster than my travel scenarios. I'm just saying that
maybe there's still even more ways of travel that haven't been imagined yet that are really fast.
But the long story short is that it seems like we have not a brand generation, but a sort of
procedural generation of new possibilities or new thoughts based upon
likely patterns that have been learned over time. So it may seem that we have sort of like random
thoughts. They're not really random, but they might be bad ideas or good ideas or just like,
and anyway, so what happens is, you know, some ideas surface and a human being thinks about them and
and depending on the conditions, you either act on those ideas or don't act on those ideas or improve
those ideas. There's some sort of deliberation process that could be shorter, could be long,
could be a move down long before the end of this long recording. But the point is that in each
stage, all of those ideas are represented by oscillating patterns by basically, you know,
what we're talking about and thinking about are the actual
learned sequences, learned patterns. Because she said in her book, models of the mind,
Grace Lindsay, she said that she was saying that the neurons don't, they only respond when there's a
change, right? Not like she was saying there was a test, right? So I want to go back and find that
because it's like, okay, you know, you can see it when you wouldn't like a brain activity to respond
as a change. If there's no change, then the pattern remains the same. So it's a difference,
it's like a difference tracker. It tracks differences over time or sequences of changes
and those changes are tracked in terms of phase patterns that increase or decrease
in learned sequences. And it's the cortical columns that learn these sequences
using individual neurons so that the way the sequences are encoded are virtual. Meaning any,
like, if the neuron that represented that sequence doesn't fire this time, another one could to
represent that activity. Because it's a whole group that has learned together, like the fireflies,
like the original book, Hebe Learning. So everyone took away this idea that Hebe Learning was,
takeaway was that neurons as far together were together. Not exactly though. Some people have said,
well, yeah, that's not exactly right. But it's because, it's not exactly right, because what
is actually right is that neurons are firing in close sequence with one another, not at the same
time. But it, but within like a few milliseconds, I think that was Peter, Peter Thessian from Princeton,
Professor at Princeton, and an author of NeuroBases for you both. But I think that really,
for me, what's interesting about Hebe and about Donald Ohab was not the idea that
learning is happening. But it's the idea that we have
a sensor, a single sensor, from the combination of multiple sensors. Right, that's interesting.
Because that, that to me says, oh, well, let's go back to fireflies and consider how, as a group,
fireflies are able to act as a single sensor because of their oscillatory activity, because
they all are reacting to each other. Anything that happens to one of them, eventually spreads,
dissipates through a dissipating pattern spreads to the rest of them. So it is like a group of
fireflies is, is a wireless consciousness. And that wireless consciousness grows in intelligence
with the, with the more feedback that it has.
