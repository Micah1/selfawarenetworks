(electromagnetism, emotion)
Wow your thread got a lot of responses. Are you in a dark place or something? The thing is no one needs a reason to live. People live automatically without needing any reason, this because people are dissipative systems, isomorphic to a vortex, a system that needs to maintain its own equilibrium, because of the fundamental interactions, gravity, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and electromagnetism.

What is your dog or cats reason for living? Animals don't need reasons, they just are. Humans don't need reasons, they just are.
Okay so if I accept your point, my counter point is that humans just are empathy and compassion at the root level, there again no reasons at all are needed for existing, one just exists as empathy, one just exists as compassion, no need for any reasons.
At this point existence is just the result of physics.
and also in my counterpoint there is no dismissal of empathy and compassion
What do you think emotion is? There is a Buddhist idea that at the core one is pure awareness, and that awareness is pure compassion, this is root level once all delusions have fallen to the way side.

I also like the idea of the non-dual meaning not two. So what if all the ideas of emotion, compassion, empathy etc are not spiritual in nature, but instead they are physical, defined in terms in physics and biology.

One further idea of non-duality can be to say that perhaps the ideas of spirituality cannot be other than physical ideas, and that even information has a physical reality, because there are not two things.

If there are not two things then emotion must be physical, and if emotion is physical then it is governed by physics. 

The dissipative system that is a human, isomorphic to a hurricane, is the root state of being, aligned with the root state of awareness, if one is awareness, and if one is truly compassion.

In my view one has to relate emotion to physics. Feel free to join my group, if you like thinking about how to define emotion, not only in terms of physics, but also in terms of computation https://www.facebook.com/groups/IFLNeuro/
