Note from August 2011

(procyon)

Real cutting edge engineers, creators, and innovators are testing out stuff all the time, and building new stuff.
I've got some inside contacts, that shared a few awesome details with me. One exciting new discovery that's being tested is this 99 dollar medical grade eeg Neurofeedback device that when combined with this awesome software from another company produces an amazing result that is just very impressive according to people behind the scenes. If you search either of these companies you will find very little mention of this, because it's not publicly released info yet.

I found out about it because I was asking the people I know about this http://brainstatetech.com/ which is like 2000 dollars for the whole treatment program which is ten sessions an hour and a half each. The results they promise sound like miracles, so I was asking people I trusted if it could be legit.

"Chuck Davis' original Roshi, as well as the Brainmaster
Atlantis, can drive the lights in glasses directly by the
EEG signal, and Chuck has made similar claims--sounds like
this is the same process only using sound instead of light.
Sound tends to be less effective than flickering light for
brain activation, as more of the brain is connected to the
eyes (40%) than ears (ca. 15%)."

I realized this applies to holosync as well, if holosync is only sound, then it's only going to be able to activate 15 percent of the brain. Light based brain entrainment is going to activate 40 percent of brain. So if you have a Procyon mind machine like the one I use regularly your going to develop deeper and faster 40 percent + 15 percent of your brain is 55 percent. No wonder I went through all 12 levels of holosync in 4 years while using the Procyon on the side. Much more of my brain was being stimulated than the average holosync user gets.

So audio based neurofeedback is never going to come close to visual feedback.

But this question wasn't about brainwave entrainment, it was about the transformative effect of Neurofeedback that you can do in your own home for less than 300 dollars, as many times as you want, unlimited treatments.

Some say that holosync is the poor man's biofeedback. Yes it helps you focus so you can increase your awareness, but the bio feedback is your own senses, your own wits, with neurofeedback your brain is going to be able to become aware of it's own patterns in an accelerated rate that will leave holosync in the dust.

Just compare the websites and iphone applications and products that these other guys are building, and they are sharing with other companies, because they are real engineers, not fat cats like Bill Harris who spend their time bragging about how they got out of a lawsuit with an unnamed company (probably hemisync who apparently claimed that Bill stole the technology that creates the audio and rebranding it.) Their websites are the real cutting edge, their products are getting

These companies are first class, holosync yeah right.

The software my inside contact mentioned was MindWorkstation and the Neurofeedback device called Neurosky, the rumor is Neurosky is truly medical grade EEG like they say, but it's super cheap like 99 dollars, this kind of thing used to cost 3500 dollars, and it still does cost like 1500 at some companies, and Mind Workstation is incredible software that takes that EEG data and makes these 3d graphs, with light and sound feedback.

It's also rumored that mindplace is going to create a new LS machine (LS = Light and Sound Machine) that is designed from the ground up to work with software like MindWorkstation and Neuroprogrammer which is also sold at Transparentcorp see link above.

The guy who sent this secret info, apparently they are building a new light and sound machine that will work really well with the Neuroprogrammer stuff, even though these three companies together are totally separate. The neuroprogrammer people are building new software to work with more biofeedback and neurofeedback machines, and new software to work with LS machines. These people are the cool people, they are working together for fun even though they are in separate companies, their engineering geeks, the real heroes, inventing new stuff all the time.

They are not wasting their cash on support teams that will explain why it's taking ten years to get the results they promise, that conceivable you could get a lot sooner with better technology that stimulates more areas of the brain at once and gives you better feedback to increase your minds awareness of itself even faster. They are not paying support staff to censor and delete messages that will benefit you as well as other companies, they are not in competition to dominate and destroy other business's.
