Waves Neurons Pattern (audio)

00:00
I've been so enthusiastic about Mark, Zuckerberg's mediverse, presentation. And what I'm seeing happening in the, in the crypto world because basically, you know, my take away is that, you know, Mark Zuckerberg really, really is bringing to get his. He's on board with the vision of crypto and the meta verse.

00:20
And he's bringing he's gonna he's gonna he's he likes to idea that you can have your, your NFTs from one game and or from a trading card game and you can bring your your trading card and it NFTs and into any way you want. You could, it's like, having your own personal storage that can go with you in the metaphors and that includes like your avatar, your clothes, you're apparel, your watch your hat, your glasses, everything could be stored basically in.

00:54
And so my proposal is that it gets it gets the first the first version of it will store it with in a for taxi cab web and that's like the so you visit your locker first and then you turn your locker into your wallet. So you get to your lockers like your personal computer that is because it's like your first layer into the the web and then you visit other web star experiences that are, you know, like multi multi user experiences.

01:21
They could be different kinds of experiences but they're like different worlds created by different people which you get to bring you with you on the into other people's experiences. And so the so the meta verses kind of is almost really kind of like ideally situated for the web where a website is like this world that you can that you can walk inside and I really love the this sort of non-linear geometry of sorry.

01:49
The non-euclidean geometry of the teeth for God application. They can try and apply with oculus with oculus quest and that is so cool because basically it takes your your real space that you can map out with your octopus quest. And it turns it into a path that you can that you can walk endlessly because it just basically we need to get to one end of it and you look around the corner it has completely redecorated.

02:16
The space is moved everything around so the furniture gets rearranged every time you you walk through a portal and so to speak and so basically like you turn around the corner and suddenly the geometry is of the room is totally different and it takes you in like you know in different weird windy paths so that it never gets old.

02:35
So you don't you forget which direction you're facing and so you can sort of like walk around these corridors like in like squeezing around these like hallways and and going through doors and like infinitely entering new spaces and it feels like you're just exploring and it's so wonderful. And I think that that would be perfect for like the ever since WebEx are.

03:01
If we basically created, if the website was basically like a 3D construct that you could walk through it or you could optionally teleport through it, right? If you want to or you could, you could optionally like, just press forward and you would, you would be pushed through it like like when you're in a fight and a shooting game, but I think that shooting games would be so much better if like multiplayer shooting games, or tag games, or dodgeball games, or tennis games would be so much more interesting with the team of God dynamic.

03:29
Because it that like, it brings you one step closer to the experience of being in a VR arcade where you're you're actual environment. Can add to your sense of immersion, like a door, could be a door physical door with with oculus and semantic, segmentation can become like a portal to another reality, right?

03:51
That could become like the door to the elevator on the Empire strikes back, right? And referring to like the Star Wars the void experience by that, which was amazing because you get, you get to touch physical things, and open physical doors and go through in, like, when you get in the elevator, like there's a meant, there's a motor under the floor in the elevator, they just shakes and that and it shakes.

04:16
As you see the elevator going up, right? So you feel like, oh my gosh, I'm actually going up, but, you know, I just there's just something underneath you that shaking and you're seeing in VR that it's going up. And then you have to like there certain times when you have to you have to carry some, some sort of I don't know if I don't know yet.

04:39
I think you had a blaster or something. You had to shoot the starship. The start troopers. Wait, it's that what? It's not the, the you had to shoot these. These these Star Wars villains, right? The bad guys from Star Wars. The imperial army which is just which is just sad that there's this like intense painful conflict between two groups of people that they have to shoot each other.

05:13
And so it's starting to very sad because there's a lot of conflict. It's war. It's a movie about war. And, and Jedi's Jedi is, who are the wise system of the warriors, but they're still fighting. Hey, so yeah, there's a lot of conflict between the, there's the, the Sith are the, the bad.

05:37
They're like either, they're like Jedi's but they're bad, they're selfish. Instead of on selfish, right? And which is it's, it's, it's it's, it's just, it's about this, like it's about a, the, the car, it's about the, it's trying to describe like the conflict inside the, the character, the protagonist in terms of being tempted to do dark things to go to the dark side.

06:14
And then, but also the, it's about the idea of redemption about being tempted to go to the dark side but also the belt, but also to it's about deciding to or trying to find a path to stay on the light side which is where happier things happen, right. If you're on the side of the light, then the roots and happier things happen.

06:38
That's kind of, that's kind of the, the story. And so it's, it is, it's, it's, it's so it's there's there's an element of social programming that to it, but it's also sort of trans. It's a like a transient narrative, which means that narratives that are have some issues structural similarity and in their sequence or in in the in the types of events that happen in the duration of the story.

07:17
In terms of like the hero going through, various different stages meeting people who are helpful. You know, having you know, to face serious challenges sometimes it's like three challenges. I I'm not the expert on this and this mythology, but that would be the topic of Star Wars and just of Campbell.

07:39
But it's also like this. It's it's about the and some sense dollars is also about the to struggle between the empire would represent sort of like the fascists who are. They've it's it's a fascistic dictatorship and that was sort of George Lucas's. The way George was Lucas, his his rapid, his like, when his cortex like was understood the political landscape from his perspective, during the years of Nixon, he saw an Nixon is basically the inspiration for for Darth Vader.

08:23
And he just saw like this, this he saw a man who was driven to be selfish and and, and bad things happened through this super powerful selfish guy, right? And and so it it's just a I don't know why I'm talking about this. Oh yeah. So I mean so this was about the meta verses is that you know with 3D semantics segmentation we can transform the computer can understand everything in your house.

09:04
So we could train. It could creatively transform anything in your house into and into something that would help, you know, like, for example, like the computer, could could, you know, see that you have a cupboard, and it could create like a game, a game event, like the, so, basically, like the game event is like, the, you know, the computer's computer program that looks for a couple board and then again, invented is created, right?

09:39
Because it identifies that, oh, these these three pixels belong to a cupboard, let's open up the cupboard and, and the user will get this potion or something and it will fly out of the virtual cupboard. So these are doesn't actually put their hands into the cupboard. But now also, the computer can see what's in the cupboard.

10:02
And if it's something like like glasses, then nothing's like in the, you know, computer might might, I don't know it. Make it look like a brick wall because it looks like a brick wall. You won't want to put your hands there, right? So the computer can do recognition like that and create like, it can learn to interact with, with your environment in a way, to turn your environment into an experience for you.

10:28
And it can basically it's, it would operate like a search function, like it looks for what what's there, and then a classifies which there in terms of it's compatibility with the number of either pre-built or basically, you know, generated with the synthesis or interpolation between other pre-built experiences. So it can creatively generate spontaneously spontaneous new experiences that are, you know, they're safe.

11:01
In terms of, you know, fitting with insert certain classes of safety parameters. In terms of like what is the range of variation in terms of creativity and what's not right? Like like maybe you could define it to creativity, in terms of like there can be color variation and if you want to or you like, you can define a parameters of like where like where there's a lot of variation that's possible and where there's very little variation as possible.

11:25
Like you wouldn't want to ever like you could you could like you you still want to kind of represent hard things. As hard, things like a cupboard would be good as a rock, it would not be good to turn a cupboard into a pillow because a person is if person bings are headings a pillow, which they might do that, they're gonna get hurt.

11:47
So you always have to represent, you know, objects, that fit certain classes, like once it's correct. They identified as a covered by the computer, it has to be skinned with things that are the if they're procedurally generated by some sort of like, again, this is program or, you know, some sort of like, you know, it's like shape.

12:13
It's like the reverse of shape completion, where it, like, you can take away part of the shape and make it look like, like, it could make it look like there's, it could replace the cupboard with a digital cover, but then it could then it could have the covered fly open, but only digitally and like a dead body could roll out or something, but nothing's actually falling out.

12:36
And in that sense, like it can do things like if like if the, if the dead arm falls in the floor, it's gonna fall on the floor like like the digit of the digital one, right? They fell at the cupboard. This is the video game and so it falls on the floor but it's like it's not going to fall in an area that it would be unsafe for you as a human being to to bend down and pick up.

13:09
So basically we were identifying the room semantically so that we can have certain classes of functions be generated by the neural network, to, to create to create an adventure for you in that adventure. Could even like, at some point in the future that those adventures could be. So, so complex that you're like, you're cooking food with with a virtual chef and real food at the same time, right?

13:43
Or you can like, you can see the real food. You can see the row ingredients and you can measure stuff and everything is safe and you get like basically it's extra safe, like everything is is sort of like like you're sent like your sensory augmentation, your sensory augmentation of the environment is enhancing your vision, right?

14:03
It's like, you know, I like in human vision. We're seeing this perception of color, even though there's that the argument is that color is not really there. It's just it's a the color red is is like color is defined by it's it's a bytes and by what's around it by it's it's phase field by.

14:25
It's that by the, it's different, it's it different in the face field, right? So color is a different frequency, but the frequency is to your brain, is just a difference, relative to everything else. And so, your brain has this sort of like, mental map of functions that are sort of, sort of rendering color based upon the comparison of contrasts and a phase field, right?

15:08
So in and so, the comparison of contrast in a phase field is a pattern that can be detected and so that's what it needs to be generated. And that comparison of contrast in a phase field is also it's the, the brain is so precise and how it's measuring this face feel that, it's able to combine multiple different represent.

15:32
It's able to learn from multiple variations on the representations of of different perspectives of incoming, sensory data and and and also your movement. And it's able to basically do what I call neural tomography and where it creates patterns basically by combining patterns and looking for the comment in in noting the common links between patterns and these patterns get learned by a large groups of neurons with are connected through accent terminals, to exit to access to externals.

16:11
And so like basically, like and the mass amount of connectivity means that basically like patterns get learned over and over again, and in layers by many different layers of neurons but many different sets of neurons. And this allows patterns to be represented by a sort of like any neurons in the brain can represent any pattern at some point because and then patterns just basically flow from one region to another through the transmission of face of phase changes.

16:48
And and so that's in that. And that sense, patterns, roll across the brain, all over the brain. If there's face changes and it because every time the phase, it's just like, you know, when like think about a chemical phase, when like a chemical phase is like in the water like like something is is transmitted from one oscillating molecule and then the next one receives that transmission and renders it fresh for the next one after that.

17:21
And so you have this like cascading sequence of basically of a pattern that is of a wave pattern. That's flowing through the molecules because they're taking turns copying the pattern that they just saw. They're basically like reacting like an excitatory now work to just like you know a pattern comes.

17:45
I'm gonna fire as soon as you see as soon as there's a touch of me, then I'm gonna create the pattern and then it's like, you know, like when you do the wave and in the at the stadium and everyone stands up and they do this way, if they with their hands in the air and they but they you do it in went in a turn like in a row.

18:03
So the way travels across the state and because people stand up and a sequence, they wait for that for the wave to get to them for they stand up and then the person next to them stands up and then the person next to them stands up. But before I got to you, it went through like, you know, the person on the edge and it goes from one end.

18:23
All the way to the other end and then sometimes it goes back again and sometimes they throw some beach balls out there. There's loud music. And everyone gets excited because it's it's a big party and that's and that idea, right? The idea you basically you need to basically, you could sort of have like every person would sort of like.

18:52
So basically, we need to

18:58
Create a pattern that is like scale and variant. It's sort of like all right so that I guess the idea of a scale and very pattern is that the microscopic pattern becomes

19:23
Sort of a representation of a of like patterns getting magnified to different scales like incoming sensory patterns, they get replicated at microscopic scales but then the largest scale patterns like like the, like the whole array that is, you know, maybe the V1 cortex, or the, or the S1 cortex, like whatever, like the first, first row of cortex is going to be renting going to be receiving the sensory data from the thalamus and and then it's going to for, you know, in the primary sensor courtesy.

20:09
I mean, and then it's going to travel from the bottom of the, the cortex in each column towards the top. And I really recommend the book, a thousand brands by Jeff Hawkins, because he goes into a lot about, how about new mentors speculation about about how the cortical column is actually, is sort of like that cortical columns represent.

20:38
Like, like it might represent like a coffee cup. That's his example, or you know, like a lighter. You can see it a lighter and it represents the orientation, like, one column. Like imagine you have a column that's represented. Imagine a lot of columns that are representing maybe thousand columns that are representing the lighter, but some of those columns are going to be in the the visual cortex.

21:02

in this matter of sensory, cortex and some of the versions of the lighter are going to be in the the audio cortex and they'll be lots of different versions of this pattern that just get like repeated across different parts of the cortex. And the basically, they it's like in and, you know, you have in an oscillator like a cortical column oscillator.

21:24
You'll have basically like a lot of neurons that are that that are connected to a lot of other neurons. And in a way that means that one neuron is. It's receptive. Field is is a sensor array of source at the same time that as a group, it's a sensor array.

21:48
Like at overlaps other overlapping other sensors are raised. It's like it's like every neuron is a sensor array. That is, that is transmitting a signal, and the signal is as a change in a faith state. And that means that collectively that a whole array, a whole row. A whole, you know, layer of a cortical column can collectively represent a pattern, which is where the phase date consists of neurons, and four different possible states.

22:26
It's like inhibited tonic firing low phase of firing and high phase of firing. And in this means that we have this like sort of four bit, phase date picture that can exist with, you know, for the basically there's this, I'm I imagine there's like it's possibly. You could just try to describe a phased field with with the in the electorate in the in the electric field and a face field in the magnetic field.

23:04
There's a face field in terms of like solid time mechanical waves or audio waves. Longitude audio waves and also a face field in terms of a chemical ways. So, you know, someone in in the nearlase podcast season one episode three, I talked to entry Watson and he suggested that there is a metallic tropic brain and an ionotropic brain, which is this is to basically talk about the theres, a receptors that that are for ions, and then there's a receptor for other there's receptors for other kinds of, like, for other kinds of cellular communication.

23:53
And, but you can send waves through liquids, right? Like, right, the ocean is is a wave and thing, right? And with the idea is that, you know, like the weight like a chemical wave. It's like the, it's this, it's one molecule is like, knocking on another molecule and the pattern of that one molecule will get transferred to the next one.

24:19
And then the next one and the next one. And so that so it just propagates and it doesn't it doesn't this paid very well because at that level the physics are of that of chemical waves are a little bit counterintuitive. So it's, it's different from, you know, some ways they dissipate over distances right.

24:48
But the point is that these are the brain has the ability to make waves and sea waves and it has a bit hit. The brain has ability to make really highly configured information. Containing phase changes that it then detects that other arrays in the brain tact. So, like, imagine that like one one part of the brain is making pictures for another part of the brain.

25:16
And then, so, the front is seeing the front pictures. And then behind it is the bat behind that is, it's that seeing pictures, it's front made. And that's, that's sort of like that. Like, I'm just like, describing it in a visual way, but but it, you could apply as the sound, you can imagine.

25:33
Like the there's a front sound and then there's, there's representations of sounds. I would love it. If it turned out that the that that audio in the brain was really sort of like like I like the idea that you have like four different consciousnesses happening so simultaneously and one of them is an audio consciousness and that is just made out of mechanical sultan waves and a longitudinal acoustic waves, right?

26:05
And that are also all the times. And basically I'm talking about like solitons in terms of magnetic solatons and and electrical times as well. So you have like and so the idea like I imagine like that light moves very fast and so you might want to have the electric waves for visual a lot of visual stuff.

26:27
Right. Maybe. And so, like maybe each is really good for easy signals are really. I mean this is weird speculation. Like I don't I don't know because you know this technically there are here's the thing. Technically, any of the mediums could represent any kind of data, it's it's idea that the patterns themselves are aligned.

26:57
So they're all all four different of soliton fields that I'm describing are, are gonna be happening simultaneously and they're all gonna be doing the same thing at the same time so they're all going to be a perfectly aligned. So there's not it's not like they're having different thoughts of different times, but it is interesting that that you're gonna get to a situation where you are,

27:31
Going to alter our exist.
