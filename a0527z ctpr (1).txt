(dopamine)
Your probably not lazy, you have a finite amount of dopamine that your brain can release each day for all it's activities. If you spend all that will-power on writing, facebook, thinking, doing whatever you do, gardening, then there will be very little motive left to do the other things beyond that. Yes I'm equating your dopamine with your willpower to do things that might earn rewards, the lower the odds of an immediate reward, the less interesting it becomes, but if we had more dopamine we would do more of the stuff that has lower odds of reward

There are things you can do to increase your brain's performance so you can do more in a day, exercises, and nutrition related things, but the other idea is that we can do more of other things by giving up some of the ways in which we use minds and bodies now.
