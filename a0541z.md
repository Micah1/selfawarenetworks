(synap) "why does no one ever like examining us left-handed folk? :(" everyone's brain is slightly different, but in large percentage of left handed folks the brain is so significantly different that it drowns out meaningful personality distinctions in the data. In comparing the data from the brains of all right handed people, it's easier to compare one brainmap to another.

Paymon Cameron Jalali Do we have to worry about any radiation used to examine our brains? Any monetary compensation?

Micah Blumberg I think of preference as a persistent modal strategy, and personality as a strategy that has been identified with through many cycles of synaptic connections (sequence memory) representing self. It means different brains take different strategic paths, and then identify with those paths formulating a social contract called your personality that reinforces the distinction of your path.

Micah Blumberg ‎"Do we have to worry about any radiation used to examine our brains? Any monetary compensation?" EEG brain mapping is like a microphone that listens to the electromagnetic sound that comes out of your skull, it doesn't emit radiation or effect your brain in any way.

Micah Blumberg Thanks Nida, I'm a brain researcher from San Francisco who uses EEG and Brainwave Entrainment to teach people to recognize their brainwaves and control their inner state in a more consciously coordinated way. Rapidly expanding self awareness, and optimizing brain activity. Uniting different regions of your mind involved in feeling, seeing, hearing, and big picture prediction.
