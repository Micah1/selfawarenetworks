   13: Space around atoms expands spatially because all particles have to oscillate, and the increasing time means greater oscillation travel times for particles (relative to or compared to travel times for particles at the center of a mass where the frequency or density of mass is higher) The way this is represented in a per interval moment of spacetime is with the relative appearance of expanded space, but expanded space is spacetime that has a greater oscillatory interval.
   14  

   16  
   17: The center of mass is like the top of the pendulum, it has the highest frequency which is also the highest mass density, and because it's frequency interval is higher it is like extra spatial surface area that is hidden in time dimensions, essentially a time crystal.
   18  

   23  
   24: Thee fast movement of an electron mass in space ought to accelerate time around the electron which is what I think the magnetic field is, accelerated time, that has an attractive interaction because of quantum gradient time dilation, while what is outside a particle mass is attractive, what is inside a particle mass might be repulsive, and that implies that the inside of the earth might be repulsive, but I guess the density of earths crust is technically repulsive in effect isn't it? We think of that as pressure, so could the center of mass in an electron be considered to have pressure and does the pressure inside an electron increase when the electron is accelerated?

   56: While the oscillator has a location the velocity around the oscillator can't be found anywhere and instead of seeing a particle with velocity we get the void of spacetime with an area magnitude that is relative to the density of the oscillating volume of mass.
   57  

   61  
   62: In a fractal cosmos it would make intuitive or visual sense for the relationship of particles to oscillate between a location existence in vortices ie atoms & galaxies, and a frequency interval that is 'an expand spacetime void' relative to the combined density of the oscillator.
   63  
   64: As space relatively expands so does time, so over time the earth gains mass from space, the total amount of time increases as space expands, what we experience as a forward interval in time is simultaneous with the expansion of space and in theory the increase in the relative density of earth (because earth as an oscillator is attracting particles, atoms, objects, and anything around it, earth is eating space, but that causes the void of space (and the duration of time) to grow in area paradoxically.)
   65  
   66: The expansion of the spacetime voice adds a new interval of scale dependent time (time gets more intervals in space vs on earth, so the clock interates faster the further it is from a dense mass. Yet the higher frequency or density of mass creates an invisible surface area in time that tips the odds of particle travel.
   67  

   87  
   88: The frequency of mass in a volume, or the density of atoms in a space, produce the 3D volumetric spacetime field as we know & experience it. What I suppose is that the spacetime field & mass alternate in existence, taking turns with one being spacetime energy while the other is a mass, or a vortice in spacetime, like a never ending pendulum, when one vortex (atom) breaks a part, the energy that is released causes another to exist somewhere else, in a never ending cycle.
   89  

  123  
  124: Because the relative appear of changing space scale (space expansion) and changing time scale (which we experience as the forward arrow of time) is just space warping between two states: That which iterates slower time with greater density, and that which iterates faster in time with less density but more spatial magnitude.

How does the density of a moving planet alter the curvature of space so as to impact the flow of the oscillation canvas of an expectation based heirarchical spatial temporal consciousness in a computer chipset? Further how can we program our artificial attractor trains of spiking neurons to balance a cellular dissipative system in response to the changing density of spacetime so as to export entropy and maintain structural equalibrium?

   94: It's like the density of spacetime is accomplished by the speed of an oscillation, but that increases collisions along all lines that equal the diameter (volume) times the velocity (speed of the cycle) of the oscillator. Whether this causes a Bose-Einstein condensate to be emitted from the oscillator or not the effect is that the vertical lines of particle activity (particles moving forward/back vs other directions) shooting from the oscillator into space time this creates a situation where when a particle is closer to an oscillator, there are a greater number of chances for it to move toward that oscillator than there are in any other direction, so if its selection of which direction to move in is truly random in each interval then it will move towards the oscillating object that is exciting the lines between it and everything that is orthogonally aligned with the center of its diameter facing perpendicular to any object, but its diameter's scale is decreasing with distance, because the waves in sp

  166: ⟪ 291 characters skipped ⟫by increasing the changes that particles fall towards them, they change the configuration of space relative to each particle in space relative to what it's oscillating with, relative to its velocity, density, mass, and direction, they increase the number of possible direction each particle could move at each interval of its time, and so over time, because it randomly moves in any direction, it is going to move towards the space where there is more spacetime essentially, because more signals are coming from where there is more spacetime,

  206: perhaps spacetime might oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like the maximum magnitude of spacetime volume like the heat death of the cosmos, and maximum frequency of mass (density per volumetric area) like the big crunch, but I suspect it spacetime never gets to either extreme and is perpetually & infinitely oscillating alternatively between both states in different areas, when one area is getting crunched another area of spacetime of being expanded by the inverse amount.
  207  

  209  
  210: This means that there never was a singularity, there never will be a big crunch or a heat death because the size of space is relative to the density of oscillators
  211  
  212: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between mass frequency (density & volume of mass) and spacetime energy magnitude, and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

  78: As for visualizing that quote, imagine a series of tesla coil pitch forks which resonate according to the acoustic density function. as the electromagnetic wave travels from one coil (pitch fork electrodes essentially) to the other, they will either resonate with the next fork in the network depending on the factors that determine wave resonance, or they will not. if they do the next fork electrode can carry that signal to the next and so on, even amplify it. Now think of each fork representing a "transistor" which if the fork vibrates due the prior in the series it represents an on, or excitatory. if it doesn't, the signal traveling doesn't resonate the full network of forks, so the ones that dont are inhibitory to the signal coherence of the information, whether encoded by the on/off analogy or the actual frequency variations

  14: ⟪ 349 characters skipped ⟫ a variation of some sort in the frequency experience that is transmitted between neurons. Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron

  24: The neural circuits, layers, and cortical columns transmit their learned patterns to every part of the brain which builds multimodal models of incoming patterns so you have hand eye coordination and can feel and see and hear the same thing, having an awareness of all the properties of an object, how it sounds, looks, feels, its temperature, orientation, location, momentum, direction, velocity, density, volume, pitch, reverb, etc etc, your whole brain gets involved in modelling all the properties of all the things you sense.

  48: fyi My Grandfather led the team that created gps and put the first gps satellite in space http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_P._Randolph from him I learned that time on a satellite moves at a different (slower) rate than it does on earths surface where the curvature of space (related to the density of mass) is greater. It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.

  91: Quantum gradient time dilation talks about mass as a time crystal but it connects neural function, the expansion & contraction of neuronal membrane during & after the action potential (and before the expansion of the dendrite) means the neuron is literally warping spacetime. The effect of the time crystal is magnified by density and it dissipates with distance (time dilation)

  33: ⟪ 894 characters skipped ⟫Simple, single beam LiDARs were also deployed, but did not provide adequate safety margins and performance. Stereo cameras were severely limited in range. A solution using a combination of high point density short and long range LiDARs, knitted together by Seoul Robotics’ software has overcome all these issues. The system is actively being co-developed with other technology providers, with planned implementations at other factory sites. Han Bin Lee: “We are looking forward to this significant implementation of 3D Vision Technology and expect it to provide massive automation benefits at a high level of safety. The experience gained in a project of this scale will be invaluable for other smart city and smart infrastructure applications”.
  34  
  35: Factory automation is exciting - but how about space debris mapping? This sounds a bit, well, spacey, but it is a real problem considering that we have been sending people and equipment into space since the 1960s. There are ~1M estimated pieces of human-created debris in space, in sizes ranging from 1 cm to several meters. These continue to multiply as collisions occur, creating what is known as the Kessler Syndrome which posits that “the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) due to space pollution is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.” Currently, only about 5% of the ~1M debris objects are mapped and tracked. The implications of this are immense since it constrains the launch of future vehicles (imagine space tourism and billionaires sipping cocktails in a hail of debris!) for various space exploration efforts.

  24  So anti matter and matter is space at completely different levels of densities. Yes
  25: 23. The density increases when the route of a matter traveling around other matter lengthens the time the amount of time before it's decay, and the density of mass increases more in some parts of the universe, because the decay rates are effected by the traveling time of matter
  26  24. Matter and Anti-matter are energy, and with a longer traveling time they are also mass. What's that silly equation something about mass being energy divided by the speed of light?
  27  25. energy equals mass times the rate of particle decay in even space, since space is not even, we get all kinds of cool effects, like light slowdown, and clocks changing their change rate at on the space shuttle because of different densities

  38: the entire cosmos is just "the metric" in general relativity, sounds a bit similar to "the matrix" doesn't it?

   30: Information is literally folds in space. This idea is based on two things. 1 is the idea that when the energy from a dense object is released the density vanishes and in its place is the opposite of density, which would be expansion (expansion relative to density, in other words density is a contraction of space relative to less dense space) 2. When information is deleted, energy is released, making information analogous to mass, and mass is information in the context of information theory where information is distinguished by the variations in a sequence from rare signals to common signals and the entire spectrum of signals in between and around rare & common signals.

That's like it's more like I fingers actually kind of like a cloud, the mostly empty space, the cloud itself has enough density to push away to push away other clouds. So you can put two fingers to up together and you can push what you can use one finger to push another finger, and the density of one cloud is pushing the other one, but if you, she zoom in at a very micro like, like, if you, if this is what I've heard, I haven't done this myself but it the, I legitly, if you zoom in with the microscope, you can't ever find the point when one finger actually touches the other one.

  17: Because because the fingers, the fingers are ultimately made out of atoms and atoms are mostly empty space. The one, the one thing that that an atom does that helps provide structure is it's sort of creates its own density, and it's moving very fast. It's oscillating. Very fast is in a sense.

And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.

  66  16:33
  67: And then the next, the next sensor is going to transmit that's going to create another image of the density of what had to travel through. Those two is two, slices is two images.

I like electricity to to fire or I don't know. Yeah, so you you would want if you wanted a huge human neuron to be exactly functionally identical to the mouse neuron which it's not you would have to add more channels in you would have to maintain the channel density that the mouse has but the that's you know, indirectly through these biophysical simulations they're arguing that it's more likely that the channel densities are.

These continue to multiply as collisions occur, creating what is known as the Kessler Syndrome which posits that “the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) due to space pollution is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.” Currently, only about 5% of the ~1M debris objects are mapped and tracked.

That's like it's more like I fingers actually kind of like a cloud, the mostly empty space, the cloud itself has enough density to push away to push away other clouds. So you can put two fingers to up together and you can push what you can use one finger to push another finger, and the density of one cloud is pushing the other one, but if you, she zoom in at a very micro like, like, if you, if this is what I've heard, I haven't done this myself but it the, I legitly, if you zoom in with the microscope, you can't ever find the point when one finger actually touches the other one.
  175:    9: Because because the fingers, the fingers are ultimately made out of atoms and atoms are mostly empty space. The one, the one thing that that an atom does that helps provide structure is it's sort of creates its own density, and it's moving very fast. It's oscillating. Very fast is in a sense.

It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.

  180:   67: And then the next, the next sensor is going to transmit that's going to create another image of the density of what had to travel through. Those two is two, slices is two images.

  101    40: If you consider that gravity is not electricity but a description of the force of one somewhat neutral gravitational field like earth on another somewhat neutral gravitational field like the moon, then the force between them is from the summary distribution configuration of all the electromagnetic forces adding and subtracting from one another by their activity. A planet can’t act like an electron for the same reason that mass is moving much more slowly than energy.

   16:   34: mass, density, and scale are 3 factors that combine to produce phase space fields that produce time
   17    46: The question is what started the first oscillation in the universe? but perhaps its about the conceptual probability of a universe existing being split between two undecidable states, 1 existing somewhere like mass, or 2 being a frequency like energy, that is defined as an interval between two points in spacetime that it takes for something with an oscillation or spin to travel.

   34  

   50    120: So earth and the moon are bending spacetime between them, but it's because each mass is combining its oscillator effect with the oscillations that make up its body, this allows for the planet to be any type of oscillator, or any combination of oscillators.
   51:   166: ⟪ 300 characters skipped ⟫sing the changes that particles fall towards them, they change the configuration of space relative to each particle in space relative to what it's oscillating with, relative to its velocity, density, mass, and direction, they increase the number of possible direction each particle could move at each interval of its time, and so over time, because it randomly moves in any direction, it is going to move towards the space where there is more spacetime essentially, because more signals are coming from where there is more spacetime, 
   52    168: because e equals mc2 energy equals mass accelerated, energy is a high frequency signal with low amplitude, mass is a low frequency (slow) signal with high amplitude
   53:   170: essentially the amplitude of mass is the density of its volume

  169    30: The earth's time dilation field, responding to the earth's mass, moves very slowly from a human perspective, but in a sense it's ripping space apart as earth moves through it, disporting space as it moves through space

  207:   30: The relative increase in the rate (frequency or density) of mass creates the gravitational effect, because it warps space like a time crystal, in one particular direction (towards the center of mass)
  208    32: It’s not space that is being warped, well it is, but more precisely it’s time that is being warped in space, there are more dimensions of spacetime where the frequency of mass is higher, and so particles and atoms move towards the areas that have increased frequency of mass.

  211    72: Hmm... I wonder if this book linked below reached a similar conclusion about mass being like a time crystal? 
  212:   91: Quantum gradient time dilation talks about mass as a time crystal but it connects neural function, the expansion & contraction of neuronal membrane during & after the action potential (and before the expansion of the dendrite) means the neuron is literally warping spacetime.

It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.

  369    27: Studying Cellular Communication is at the center of everything in biology, everything that exists in space is folded space, including information, essentially mass is information & information is mass, and while we can say that information is invariant to any particular mass, it is essentially always encoded in mass, including when information is in the brain, traveling through the air, or in the memory system of a computer. Regardless of its substrate, information is a pattern defined by variances in mass.
  370:   29: Information is literally folds in space. This idea is based on two things. 1 is the idea that when the energy from a dense object is released the density vanishes and in its place is the opposite of density, which would be expansion (expansion relative to density, in other words density is a contraction of space relative to less dense space) 2. When information is deleted, energy is released, making information analogous to mass, and mass is information in the context of information theory where information is distinguished by the variations in a sequence from rare signals to common signals and the entire spectrum of signals in between and around rare & common signals. 
  371:   33: ⟪ 528 characters skipped ⟫ve to our time, so when spacetime has form, that form exists as a fold of time, so it must slow relative to absolute time, because at full speed, at light speed space & time collapse, and there is no mass, no density, it’s just light full speed. If we could get there we wouldn’t be there, if we could go at light speed we would become light.
  372    37: So let's say the universe sums up to 0, but in between there are folds of time that exist as -1 or +1, or fractions there on the X axis, and those would be positive and negatively charged particles, but let's put time on the Y axis, because the speed of the particle, positive or negative, relative to C (light speed) is going to encode it’s mass effect.

So muscle has three times the the density of fat like so a pound of muscle is one third the size of a pound of fat because it's more dense. And so because so basically it's just like saying that planets are dense points in space, but the dense points in space are the hot points.
  418    249: That's right. That's causing contracted space to expand in time, but it's causing energy to expand and volume in. In a relationship with it's causally the expansion of the volume of energy, which is the space around. So, the energy is a space energy. So the volume of energy around a mass is relative to that mass, but essentially the volume is like if space is a single sheet, okay?

However these things only exist relative to each other, the total heat and cold neutralizes out, and the total volume of space is the inverse relationship of time to space, as time increases space contracts, as time decreases space expands.

   204     92: So the argument for why time dilation around a mass is scale dependent could be that the electromagnetic wave field pattern of space is defined relative to dense oscillators such as planets.
   205:    94: It's like the density of spacetime is accomplished by the speed of an oscillation, but that increases collisions along all lines that equal the diameter (volume) times the velocity (speed of the cycle) of the oscillator. Whether this causes a Bose-Einstein condensate to be emitted from the oscillator or not the effect is that the vertical lines of particle activity (particles moving forward/back vs other directions) shooting from the oscillator into space time this creates a situation where when a particle is closer to an oscillator, there are a greater number of chances for it to move toward that oscillator than there are in any other direction, so if its selection of which direction to move in is truly random in each interval then it will move towards the oscillating object that is exciting the lines between it and everything that is orthogonally aligned with the center of its diameter facing perpendicular to any object, but its diameter's scale is decreasing with distance, because the waves in sp
   206     98: The phase state of two electrons in orbit would cause them to merge, but I think by merging they would become faster, so they are merging in a temporal way. Like two oscillators with the same phase pattern they can easily merge, but the oscillating pattern of a proton or a neutron cannot merge with an electron because the phase states are not aligned, and that means the shortest path between them isn't the most direct path, and the result is that neutrons and electrons and protons fall into orbits that prevent them from colliding.
   207    120: So earth and the moon are bending spacetime between them, but it's because each mass is combining its oscillator effect with the oscillations that make up its body, this allows for the planet to be any type of oscillator, or any combination of oscillators.
   208:   122: The combined effect of many oscillators is going to bend space time because each oscillator, and each group of oscillators is bending spacetime according to the density of their combined effect
   209    124: specifically the center of the perpendicular diameter of any oscillating body, adjusted by its delta in configuration space towards any object in space 

   211    143: oscillation causes the expansion of space also because it creates more heat
   212:   146: oscillations create more space time relative to their density which is how many particles are oscillating together amplifying each other's effect to create an oscillating body
   213    150: The temporal velocity of combined oscillators in huge things like planets is going to create a large-scale gravitational effect on the local scale, but past a certain threshold it's going to have the opposite effect where space seems to get more stretched out.

   216    164: the whole of space at the largest scale is either one oscillation or its many, because its size is relative to its oscillations
   217: ⟪ 298 characters skipped ⟫by increasing the changes that particles fall towards them, they change the configuration of space relative to each particle in space relative to what it's oscillating with, relative to its velocity, density, mass, and direction, they increase the number of possible direction each particle could move at each interval of its time, and so over time, because it randomly moves in any direction, it is going to move towards the space where there is more spacetime essentially, because more signals are coming from where there is more spacetime, 
   218:   170: essentially the frequency of mass is it's density per it's oscillating body ie it's volume
   219    173: because all of the oscillations of mass are merging together as much as they can exciting each other, 

   222    194: heat as oscillations in time
   223:   203: galaxies are pushing themselves apart propionate to their volume, mass, density, and velocity, they are expanding space in time inside the oscillator, and expanding time in space outside the oscillator.
   224    205: so there is an inversion where time is expanding inside the oscillator, and space is expanding outside the oscillator, and the two expansions are linked, relative and inverted

   272    198: disruptions in the oscillator dynamics of spacetime could be caused by an influx of energy but also by an outflow of energy
   273:   202: perhaps spacetime might oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like the maximum magnitude of spacetime volume like the heat death of the cosmos, and maximum frequency of mass (density per volumetric area) like the big crunch, but I suspect it spacetime never gets to either extreme and is perpetually & infinitely oscillating alternatively between both states in different areas, when one area is getting crunched another area of spacetime of being expanded by the inverse amount.
   274:   206: This means that there never was a singularity, there never will be a big crunch or a heat death because the size of space is relative to the density of oscillators
   275:   208: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between mass frequency (density & volume of mass) and spacetime energy magnitude, and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

   445:    9: The gravity is the result of the electromagnetic field being warped into a spatial expansion an oscillating object that represents something like the inverse of its velocity and density which is like space crunched and hotter because its moving relatively faster in time
   446    24: But consider that attractive force between two electrons that repel is negative, and consider that when you combine a field particles together, their electric force is greater if they are aligned, and it weakens if the ions are not aligned. If gravitational force is the alignment of the electrical field then its strength can increase or decrease depending upon the alignment of the charges in that field, and the warping of space by an oscillating mass like the earth is going to have either an attractive or repulsive force depending on the trajectory of particles in it

   529    12: The scale of an oscillating particle such as a W boson is going to dissipate in a vaccum because the signals that it is giving off are bigger than the signals it is receiving off, it is spending its energy over time and eventually it decays because of entropy, entropy because of the math of oscillators, with particles being oscillators Bosons, or attractors for oscillations in the case of Fermions that are splayed in time, but are coherent in space. With the Fermion Condensate responsible for multiscale fermion condesate lines emerging between oscillators, each of them heating up and expanding the space between them resulting in the curvature of spacetime through a combination of multiscale soliton waves in the photonic fields with electricity charge sensation (high frequency/time), magnetism(high amplitude/spatial feel), mechanical vibrational acoustic (sound and inner voice), thermal (hot/cold data for processing hot cold sensation), and chemical (feeling energy state vitality sleep in-the-zone) and the correlations of patterns across all modalities.
   530: ⟪ 355 characters skipped ⟫ a variation of some sort in the frequency experience that is transmitted between neurons. Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron
   531    18: but the basic idea is that the patterns that can be learned are modality invariant, because information patterns are substrate invariant, the information is the encoded sequences of phase state changes that trigger novel oscillation patterns relative to the expected tonic firing rate of neurons, and the inhibited inception field defined by that neurons exit terminal,

It's like, oscillating, eating other oscillations. So, the volume of space time and energy and the mass of space time.
  1363:   213: Okay. And then density exercise heat and the density with excitation. Oh yeah. So right, the density of the planets excites and heats space but the density means that space is moving really fast. It's the same as like a beam. So like a beam just spreads out and spreads out and spreads out, All right, But if you have oscillators orbiting, then they have the force of an elevator.
  1364    216: But they don't have to go anywhere. In fact, they're going to, they're going to, it's going to be situations where you have oscillators essentially like attract oscillators.

  1714     62: Okay, so that's part. So if we make self-aware networks with, and they basically can interface with the world, the way human beings interface with each other and they were they will be effectively oscillating in a functional way with the rest of the universe. And that will change the oscillations of the rest of the universe, right?
  1715:    70: You know, with with the ability to change the the the density and gravitational effects of space, by changing the the oscillations and materials, you know. Yeah, the opportunity is first for space. Travel are interesting. And, you know, like if we understand basically how to warp space time, I'm just like, you know, like you think of the terms of warp drive, right?
  1716     74: Attach the you order your list to ideas with the arguments you're making and then attach the replicas. So, maybe the debt, maybe the dances and most complex oscillator is going to exert the most attractive influence. And so if you turn that into like, functionally speaking, maybe the against the dances and most

  1743     24: You have like a if you have like a mega star megaphone, right? That's it's the principle of a megaphone. It's got a shape that amplifies, is it sound? It sound oscillates along the rings. It's, it's shape becomes magnified as long as there's and if you so you're increase the amplitude of the sound, it goes more widely.
  1744:    32: So if it's oscillating to get, if everything is oscillating together then it should have a magnified pressure or density. But if things are, if if the oscillations are if it's not oscillating together as a mass then it might have is a single mass and it might have much less density.
  1745     34: Yeah, so that's interesting. It's like, you could be depth by something. I changing its by changing the oscillation patterns of the molecule. So, if you disrupt, the oscillations of a set of molecules, you would identify them, you know, that would be like But at the same time, if you, if you cause the, if you enter, if you could, if you could somehow and train the odds of the, the molecule of the material, to, to oscillate together, then you would densify.

  2008     3: Universe Atoms Oscillation
  2009:    9: Because because the fingers, the fingers are ultimately made out of atoms and atoms are mostly empty space. The one, the one thing that that an atom does that helps provide structure is it's sort of creates its own density, and it's moving very fast. It's oscillating. Very fast is in a sense.
  2010:   11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.
  2011    17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.

Whether this causes a Bose-Einstein condensate to be emitted from the oscillator or not the effect is that the vertical lines of particle activity (particles moving forward/back vs other directions) shooting from the oscillator into space time this creates a situation where when a particle is closer to an oscillator, there are a greater number of chances for it to move toward that oscillator than there are in any other direction, so if its selection of which direction to move in is truly random in each interval then it will move towards the oscillating object that is exciting the lines between it and everything that is orthogonally aligned with the center of its diameter facing perpendicular to any object, but its diameter's scale is decreasing with distance, because the waves in sp
  2525:    27:   122: The combined effect of many oscillators is going to bend space time because each oscillator, and each group of oscillators is bending spacetime according to the density of their combined effect
  2526:    28:   146: oscillations create more space time relative to their density which is how many particles are oscillating together amplifying each other's effect to create an oscillating body
  2527:    29:   166: ⟪ 291 characters skipped ⟫by increasing the changes that particles fall towards them, they change the configuration of space relative to each particle in space relative to what it's oscillating with, relative to its velocity, density, mass, and direction, they increase the number of possible direction each particle could move at each interval of its time, and so over time, because it randomly moves in any direction, it is going to move towards the space where there is more spacetime essentially, because more signals are coming from where there is more spacetime, 
  2528:    31:   203: galaxies are pushing themselves apart propionate to their volume, mass, density, and velocity, they are expanding space in time inside the oscillator, and expanding time in space outside the oscillator.
  2529:    34:   204: This means that there never was a singularity, there never will be a big crunch or a heat death because the size of space is relative to the density of oscillators
  2530:    35:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  2531:    45:    9: The gravity is the result of the electromagnetic field being warped into a spatial expansion an oscillating object that represents something like the inverse of its velocity and density which is like space crunched and hotter because its moving relatively faster in time
  2532:    55:   14: ⟪ 349 characters skipped ⟫ a variation of some sort in the frequency experience that is transmitted between neurons. Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron
  2533:   106:   8: the non-magnetic part of the EM spectrum is gravitational spectrum, it's about the oscillating curvature of space, the morphology of the vector field that has been embedded into the shape of space as part of the expanding wave of a dense oscillating particle, such as an atom or such as a star, each of which cast a wave into space corresponding to their scale (volume), density, heat, and its kinetic & angular momentum
  2534:   136:   49: ⟪ 370 characters skipped ⟫ement of a smaller wave through a larger wave, so what I am suggesting is that space as a whole is like a wave/particle in the sense that space and time are just different from a particle in terms of density, scale & distance between oscillations. All of space down to human cells consists of a fractal tree of functional ismorphic oscillations or dissipative systems, the universe has been described as a system of harmonic waves at the quantum scale, and we can sense vibrations, powerful resonations in part because our whole bodies are made of this sensitive material, but our bodies and minds 
  2535:   145:   213: Okay. And then density exercise heat and the density with excitation. Oh yeah. So right, the density of the planets excites and heats space but the density means that space is moving really fast. It's the same as like a beam. So like a beam just spreads out and spreads out and spreads out, All right, But if you have oscillators orbiting, then they have the force of an elevator.
  2536:   159:   70: You know, with with the ability to change the the the density and gravitational effects of space, by changing the the oscillations and materials, you know. Yeah, the opportunity is first for space. Travel are interesting. And, you know, like if we understand basically how to warp space time, I'm just like, you know, like you think of the terms of warp drive, right?
  2537:   162:   32: So if it's oscillating to get, if everything is oscillating together then it should have a magnified pressure or density. But if things are, if if the oscillations are if it's not oscillating together as a mass then it might have is a single mass and it might have much less density.
  2538:   171:    9: Because because the fingers, the fingers are ultimately made out of atoms and atoms are mostly empty space. The one, the one thing that that an atom does that helps provide structure is it's sort of creates its own density, and it's moving very fast. It's oscillating. Very fast is in a sense.
  2539:   172:   11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.

  2543  

  2572    220:   11: but life is a fractal body of cooperative oscillations that have what I will call expert memory structures inside a globally aware self-aware network
  2573:   233:   49: ⟪ 465 characters skipped ⟫ is like a wave/particle in the sense that space and time are just different from a particle in terms of density, scale & distance between oscillations.

  2574    246: ⟪ 337 characters skipped ⟫thinking about a specific memory detail, like the texture of a cup, the synaptic connections that my represent the properties cup in our cortical columns are expressed, magnified through inhibition & oscillation, to the meso scale, and eventually they effect the pattern of large scale dipoles, of brainwave activity, which means they are seen by the whole brain at the macroscale, thats when our parietal temporal junction is lit up and we are focused on something, that's a macroscale focus on pattern that is stored in synaptic connections in a cortical column.

  2608      69:   43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.

  2610      76:   210: but since high frequency signals travel across oscillators, in a long enough timeline everyone eventually intuits everyone elses secrets

  2620     205:   13: ⟪ 281 characters skipped ⟫ covers those ways in his chapter as well. Tse dismisses the notion that consciousness could be quantum, because the brain is too warm for quantum coherence, (the temperature would scramble the "you" frequency). He also thinks that indeterministic quantum fluctuations could interfere with the timing of a neural oscillation just enough to make a human unpredictable to any machine that was not able to simulate or predict all the quantum noise in a person's brain. That's the boring part.
  2621: ⟪ 363 characters skipped ⟫ a variation of some sort in the frequency experience that is transmitted between neurons. Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron
  2622     210:   35: the sparsity of high frequency soliton learning is good for modelling ultra tiny patterns phase changes in the oscillating quantum field, that potentially has memories encoded in the transformations of particles through different states. So the whole field of spacetime learns patterns as configurations evolve through natural selection. Sort of like oscillating patterns growing to eventually put the entire brain in sync

  2704     802:   16: So it's able to send but it doesn't send us alternate, but I think perhaps it doesn't send us all it's underway to other neurons. This end of the nerve, transmitters instead. And then there are transmitters are transmitted in timing. All right, so that's carrying the type of frequency of how of our frequency is carving dot matrix and the oscillator, right?
  2705:    817:   11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.
  2706     818:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.

  2742    1102:   109:   66: # antigravity or anti-gravity propulsion might be a splay state oscillation to the oscillation frequency of gravity

  3190     51:   222: its because gravity is accomplished by the em field traffic lanes emerging the fusion of fermionic condensation from dense oscillators (any oscillator as small as an atom or large as a galaxy) 

  3195     87:   128: The origin of the higgs field & dark gravity its this idea that the oscillating stars & galaxies are not only affecting each other's gravity, but they are leaving gravity trails AND they are creating gravity lanes between them by heating the space between them, the idea of the higgs field is that excited hot space is adding mass to particles, 
  3196:    92:    9: The gravity is the result of the electromagnetic field being warped into a spatial expansion an oscillating object that represents something like the inverse of its velocity and density which is like space crunched and hotter because its moving relatively faster in time
  3197    110:   64: which means gravity oscillates like a wave

  3300     48:   120: So earth and the moon are bending spacetime between them, but it's because each mass is combining its oscillator effect with the oscillations that make up its body, this allows for the planet to be any type of oscillator, or any combination of oscillators.

  3302     52:   173: because all of the oscillations of mass are merging together as much as they can exciting each other, 
  3303:    53:   203: galaxies are pushing themselves apart propionate to their volume, mass, density, and velocity, they are expanding space in time inside the oscillator, and expanding time in space outside the oscillator.

  3306     77:   16: Mass is the Magnitude of many volumetric frequencies (particles) oscillating together. With the inverse relationship between magnitude & frequency defining spacetime at all scales, from galaxies, to EEG powerbands, to nmda spikes & soma bursts, to particles.

  3316    355:   61: the arc of the oscillating of mass is shorter

  3322    431:    99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
  3323:   461:   32: So if it's oscillating to get, if everything is oscillating together then it should have a magnified pressure or density. But if things are, if if the oscillations are if it's not oscillating together as a mass then it might have is a single mass and it might have much less density.
  3324    496: ⟪ 310 characters skipped ⟫ not a lightfield that has no mass, where light is mixing with encoded wave patterns to create a lightfield. That's not what I predict is happening in the brain. Instead I predict that we have neural oscillatory tomographic information emerging from (and connecting) the topography of phase patterns over time, so that each variant or version of the pattern (as represented by different neurons) is representing a different view of the object that's being learned or the sequence that's being learned (or recalled at that moment. but then merged together or entified via temporal synching.

  3326    685:    17:   118: I think Quantum Gravity is the result of space warping around oscillator flows, or large scale wave patterns in the electromagnetic field around masses caused by the interactions of oscillators of different scales with different properties.
