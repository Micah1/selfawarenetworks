Note from March 2014

I don't want to impose my past or present spiritual,  religious, or mythological view points on anyone else.
I think folks are free to make up their own minds.
Note: this note is not meant to be included in the book, except perhaps for the paragraph about conjoined twins
(conjoined twins, memory, speculation about how the mind works & viewpoints on buddhist like spirituality)

I'm very interested in brainwave entrainment, using tones, beats, and music to alter brainwaves and alter states of mind, accomplishing an inner expansion of spatial metaphors defining reality and being.

I don't think its a situation where one person has to be wrong in order for another person to be right. I'm sort of saying its like there is more than one valid point of view. I take the view that there is zero percent chance of spirituality, but that is the perspective I have to have forever. It doesn't make my view more right than your view, just different. There are perhaps no right views.

but anyway, since DNA is formed in various ways due to binding of compatible codon sequences; a process determined by hydrogen bonds/electronegativity reactions between combinations of nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorous, and carbon, which makes the formation of DNA sequences dependent on the electromagnetic gauge force. my theory is that the electromagnetic vibrational energy of 528 Hz simulates the formation of specific start codons with a corresponding resonate frequency which initiate DNA repair, or in other words the vibration either "mimics" an information signal responsible for repair, or 528 Hz is the repair signal itself. my other theory is that the frequency 528 Hz stimulates the entire nucleotide system to induce codon pairing due to excitation of the molecules and that its symmetry in sacred geometrics and electromagnetic resonance with DNA structure corresponds to/activates the similarly symmetrical process of DNA repair.

"i used to be the exact same" that's not true.

you see it as a sequence, in the past your views were A, then you had some experiences, and your views became B. So you hear what I say and you think oh his views are like A, like the views I had before I had some experiences that changed my views to B, so obviously B is next for his views.

I'm saying it's not like a sequence. I never shared similar views to whatever was A for you. That A is nothing like, nothing similar to what I believe, the similarity is an illusion.

no man i see it as a superposition of infinite possibility, regardless of my thought "sequence" your current thought will be ?? while your later beliefs will still be ??.

i am simply saying that data can be communicated by trying to place a value on an uncertainty variable in order to relate it to prior knowledge and experience. otherwise there would be no point in human interaction if peoples thoughts and perspective couldn't be guesstimated and related to

I have had more profound spiritual experiences than I can count. I've seen the very beginning of the cosmos, the big bang. I saw it, and it was amazing. I have visualized how the whole universe right now is a fractal adding up to the very beginning of space. Yet it is possible to understand that this is not spirituality.

It's my premise, as the guardian of something, to protect the sacred truths in the capability of a physical mind against the tyrannical delusion of spirituality that pervades so many realms.

There are many levels of delusion, and spirituality is one of them. You can go back and forth for a long time, from A to B, from B to A, and back again, until you find out what it is that you are here to protect. Which perspective you are here to be a guardian for. That's what I came to share.

my spiritual experienes have taught me of the illusions of realtity as well. but they have also taught me to control and dictate the direction of my life through spiritual techniques. spirituality may be nothing more than a manifestation of my mind and the unique factors i associate with it. why should that mean that its not real

Micah Blumberg I've used very precise tools for cutting through delusion. The five ranks of tozan, big mind, big heart, great doubt, great fear, great hopelessness, great freedom, great joy. Great doubt is one such tool that you take on, like a mask, a character, and a voice, you become it, you doubt everything, everything becomes another delusion to cut away, even the deepest most profound spiritual experiences become another delusion to root out, and cut down. Cut it down, cut down the false tree called spirituality.

i agree root out the delusions. but real spirituality is rare, it is true enlightenment, self actualization, and the very essence of it burns all illusion away and there is only what is and what is is everything

it is all about belief, for your beliefs, your vibrations, thoughts, are what shape your reality around you

"it is all about belief" no its not, in this statement you are, how do I explain this, sort of like seeking the causes, it's what a brain does, pieces of memory chain together to predict the causes, any and all causes. so in saying it's all about belief its like looking for causality, and in the same context looking for causality as the solution for something, solution seeking, or just plain seeking is the way, but the solution is not that, throw away the solutions.

The way to find the path is through seeking, but the seeker can't be satisfied because its job is to seek. Yet without the seeker we are each lost. As the way you are already everywhere, and you have no where to go, and nothing to do, no need for beliefs at all. Truly nothing matters because all is innately well. No need for agreement. Spirituality is a very tough and nasty root, so dig hard against it in your mind, because it stands between some seeker and their enlightened path, the thirst of which must never be quenched.

you make good points, but i believe spirituality is to have a belief that is not just an ideal, it is a part of you and a person like this is never disappointed for they have no need to seek for everything is already found before it was even lost, and the person is then free for they do not need to seek, only shift their perspective as to lens out information from the super matrix and then connect and relate the information in new ways

this is an extremely contrary subject, as there are as many different opinions as there are people and then some. as you stated, i will never be able to make(show) you experience my experiences exactly. however ive actually been doing some research into possible ways of transferring experience thought perspective and emotion with the aid of bci tech

There are conjoined twins who can see through each others eyes at will. One girl can know for example which color crayon you are holding up for the other girl to see. With technology one day we will be able to link together human brains to see through they eyes of other people. This however is missing the real picture of what is going on.

No one can experience your experiences, and you can't experience your experiences.

What's happening is that pieces of memory are linking together first and last time each time a person has any kind of experience. A memory of a previous experience is actually a new thing, only existing for a matter of milliseconds.

There is no transferring of memories or experiences that can be possible because there are no memories or experiences inside a person's brain. There exists only the probable likelihoods of certain memories or ideas or experiences that could be activated as something new that feels old.

"my experiences" another deep root, another delusion waiting to be cut down, another false Buddha standing in the way of the enlightened path.

so you don't see spirituality as the process that cuts down the delusions that stand in the way of enlightenment

spirituality is nothing except another delusion to be cut away

"my experiences", my memories, transferable perspectives, and spirituality are all delusions to be scrapped, and chucked.

they are like temporal constructs, ghosts, probabilities that existed for milliseconds never to exist again, let them go, and they can return, but they are not real, delusions

thought is delusion, all of it, it's the nature of a temporal consciousness, a system of delusional bets to coordinate movement
