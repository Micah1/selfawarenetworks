personality (audio)

00:00

I think I'm imagining my mind as a volumetric space, or as a volumetric video, right? Like over here this is a point cloud in my vision, and it has audio cues, and I can feel it. It has mechano-sensitive predictions for the (physical) properties (of the room), and the orientations of items within the visual representation (that is my minds rendering of the ecosystem I'm in)

00:29

(This experience includes) orientation sounds that might come from the orientation & velocity of (some) object, and its properties (imagine an arrow that whistles as it flies past you). Then I have a representation of the room that I'm in which is eight by eight & a half feet.

00:54

And so it's a small room, right? Like a bedroom.

A small bedroom might be 10 by 10 or 10 by 12. That's a small bedroom or a closet for some people like they have closets bigger than that right? So this is a small room, and I am just sort of like imagining the four walls is being like a volumetric space that's sort of taking place inside my head.

01:27

Like somehow this volumetric space is calculated by different oscillating (phase) patterns in my head somehow. I'm imagining

01:58

that I am changing my personality, or my gender perspective, or imagine that I am playing a role like playing the roles of different characters in a play.

What I imagine is that my framework, that frames my personality attributes is like a physical structure (that attracts certain oscillatory patterns) and is sort of overlayed & visible on top of the world that I see. So that I could be reacting to the front path of that personality architecture, or the back half of it, or the different like curve or shape of it.

02:25

Like, it could be curved, or it could be cuurved, it could be carved, right? (Humor)

I can imagine this curve-atar, that changes my personality a little right, and I have this intuition that I can curve it more, or uncurve it, and flatten it out. I can flatten out my personality (like an actor)

What I'm saying is like, I am sensing that there is these spatial patterns inside of these sequences, temporal sequences that are invisibly overlayed on top of my visual perception of reality and my auditory via the sounds I hear

03:09

There's so I would say experiencing reality is like experiencing multiple senses layered on top of each other, and all the senses sort of corresponding to a space thats 3D plus 1D, right? 3 dimensions of space, and one dimension of time, to the sort of describe what's happening.

03:40

And But yeah.
