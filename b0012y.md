I think I'm imagining my mind as a volumetric space. It's a volumetric video. And over here, this is a point cloud in my vision, and it has audio cues, and I can feel it. It has mechano-sensitive predictions for the physical properties of the room and the orientations of items within the visual representation, which is my mind's rendering of the ecosystem I'm in.

This experience includes orientation sounds that might come from the orientation and velocity of some object, like an arrow that whistles as it flies past you, and its properties. But then I have the whole, like I imagine, the representation of the room that I'm in. The room is like eight by eight and a half feet, and this is a small room, right? Like a bedroom. A small bedroom might be 10 by 10 or 10 by 12; that's a small bedroom. Or a closet for some people, like they have closets bigger than that, right? So this is a small room, and I am just sort of like imagining that the four walls are being like a volumetric space that's sort of taking place inside my head.

Somehow this volumetric space is calculated by different oscillating (phase) patterns in my head somehow. So I'm imagining now if I'm changing my personality and changing my gender perspective, like I can play a role, like I can play the roles of different characters, like in a play. But what I imagine is that my framework for that frame as my personality attributes is like a physical structure that attracts certain oscillatory patterns and is sort of overlaid invisibly on top of the world that I see.

So that I could be reacting to the front half of that personality architecture or the back half of it, or the different curve or shape of it. Like it could be curved, it could be cuurved, it could be carved, right? (Humor). Like I can imagine this "Carvitar"; it changes my personality a little, right? And I can curve it or uncurve it, flatten it out. I have this intuition that I can curve it more or flatten it, and I can flatten out my personality like an actor.

And it's interesting because it's like what I'm saying is that I am sensing that there are these spatial patterns inside these sequences, temporal sequences that are invisibly overlaid on top of my visual perception of reality and my auditory and the sounds I hear. So I would say it's like experiencing reality is like experiencing multiple senses layered on top of each other, and all the senses sort of corresponding to a space that's 3D plus 1D, right? Three dimensions of space and one dimension of time to describe what's happening.

But yeah.
