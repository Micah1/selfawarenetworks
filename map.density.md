New plan: Because you cannot download the wiki on the chromebook ONLY EDIT THE MAPS in the regular self aware networks repo, and then copy them to the wiki when you have wifi.

Each map page is a time-stamped copy of a wikipage. The wiki pages ought to be time stamped but I have not yet discovered where it can be shown.

  3: (humor) Word of the day "Computational-AstroNeuroPhysics" what kind of neuromorphic chip based program simulates the holographic duality of quantum fluctuations in the microtubules of your neurons that drive everyone crazy while Mercury is in retrograde ostensibly because of gravitational or electromagnetic forces? How does the density of a moving planet alter the curvature of space so as to impact the flow of the oscillation canvas of an expectation based heirarchical spatial temporal consciousness in a computer chipset? Further how can we program our artificial attractor trains of spiking neurons to balance a cellular dissipative system in response to the changing density of spacetime so as to export entropy and maintain structural equalibrium? Welcome to "Computational-AstroNeuroPhysics 101" This is a class your grandchildren will be taking in the future. To begin your study read this: http://medicalxpress.com/print293346930.html

a0041z.md:
   94: It's like the density of spacetime is accomplished by the speed of an oscillation, but that increases collisions along all lines that equal the diameter (volume) times the velocity (speed of the cycle) of the oscillator. Whether this causes a Bose-Einstein condensate to be emitted from the oscillator or not the effect is that the vertical lines of particle activity (particles moving forward/back vs other directions) shooting from the oscillator into space time this creates a situation where when a particle is closer to an oscillator, there are a greater number of chances for it to move toward that oscillator than there are in any other direction, so if its selection of which direction to move in is truly random in each interval then it will move towards the oscillating object that is exciting the lines between it and everything that is orthogonally aligned with the center of its diameter facing perpendicular to any object, but its diameter's scale is decreasing with distance, because the waves in sp
  122: The combined effect of many oscillators is going to bend space time because each oscillator, and each group of oscillators is bending spacetime according to the density of their combined effect
  146: oscillations create more space time relative to their density which is how many particles are oscillating together amplifying each other's effect to create an oscillating body
  166: ⟪ 291 characters skipped ⟫by increasing the changes that particles fall towards them, they change the configuration of space relative to each particle in space relative to what it's oscillating with, relative to its velocity, density, mass, and direction, they increase the number of possible direction each particle could move at each interval of its time, and so over time, because it randomly moves in any direction, it is going to move towards the space where there is more spacetime essentially, because more signals are coming from where there is more spacetime, 
  170: essentially the amplitude of mass is the density of its volume
  203: galaxies are pushing themselves apart propionate to their volume, mass, density, and velocity, they are expanding space in time inside the oscillator, and expanding time in space outside the oscillator.

a0049z.md:
  204: This means that there never was a singularity, there never will be a big crunch or a heat death because the size of space is relative to the density of oscillators
  206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  255: the density of mass is like the contraction of space through the increase in time frequency

  78: As for visualizing that quote, imagine a series of tesla coil pitch forks which resonate according to the acoustic density function. as the electromagnetic wave travels from one coil (pitch fork electrodes essentially) to the other, they will either resonate with the next fork in the network depending on the factors that determine wave resonance, or they will not. if they do the next fork electrode can carry that signal to the next and so on, even amplify it. Now think of each fork representing a "transistor" which if the fork vibrates due the prior in the series it represents an on, or excitatory. if it doesn't, the signal traveling doesn't resonate the full network of forks, so the ones that dont are inhibitory to the signal coherence of the information, whether encoded by the on/off analogy or the actual frequency variations

  26: ⟪ 349 characters skipped ⟫lectrons align the greater the electrical force gets, this explains the difference between the electric force and the gravity force that we experience. A planet that was the same size but had greater density would have a much more powerful gravitational force, because its greater density means that ions are more aligned, positive charges are more aligned.

Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron
  24: The neural circuits, layers, and cortical columns transmit their learned patterns to every part of the brain which builds multimodal models of incoming patterns so you have hand eye coordination and can feel and see and hear the same thing, having an awareness of all the properties of an object, how it sounds, looks, feels, its temperature, orientation, location, momentum, direction, velocity, density, volume, pitch, reverb, etc etc, your whole brain gets involved in modelling all the properties of all the things you sense.

It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.

  30: The relative increase in the rate (frequency or density) of mass creates the gravitational effect, because it warps space like a time crystal, in one particular direction (towards the center of mass)
  34: The density can trigger fermionic condensates, which amplify the quantum scale gravitation effect, or really the quantum gradient time dilation effect.
  91: Quantum gradient time dilation talks about mass as a time crystal but it connects neural function, the expansion & contraction of neuronal membrane during & after the action potential (and before the expansion of the dendrite) means the neuron is literally warping spacetime. The effect of the time crystal is magnified by density and it dissipates with distance (time dilation)

  33: ⟪ 894 characters skipped ⟫Simple, single beam LiDARs were also deployed, but did not provide adequate safety margins and performance. Stereo cameras were severely limited in range. A solution using a combination of high point density short and long range LiDARs, knitted together by Seoul Robotics’ software has overcome all these issues. The system is actively being co-developed with other technology providers, with planned implementations at other factory sites. Han Bin Lee: “We are looking forward to this significant implementation of 3D Vision Technology and expect it to provide massive automation benefits at a high level of safety. The experience gained in a project of this scale will be invaluable for other smart city and smart infrastructure applications”.
  35: Factory automation is exciting - but how about space debris mapping? This sounds a bit, well, spacey, but it is a real problem considering that we have been sending people and equipment into space since the 1960s. There are ~1M estimated pieces of human-created debris in space, in sizes ranging from 1 cm to several meters. These continue to multiply as collisions occur, creating what is known as the Kessler Syndrome which posits that “the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) due to space pollution is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.” Currently, only about 5% of the ~1M debris objects are mapped and tracked. The implications of this are immense since it constrains the launch of future vehicles (imagine space tourism and billionaires sipping cocktails in a hail of debris!) for various space exploration efforts.

  25: 23. The density increases when the route of a matter traveling around other matter lengthens the time the amount of time before it's decay, and the density of mass increases more in some parts of the universe, because the decay rates are effected by the traveling time of matter
  28: Energy equals Mass multiplied by the collision rate of matter and anti-matter in ideal space (even space with no density)
  31: I will call the theory "Very Specific Relativity" new short summary: matter evolves in complexity because of the uneven quantum possibility, resulting broken fractals, resulting in novel patterns of matter and matter density resulting the natural selection of patterns in space, resulting in evolution of patterns, and thus space began to think, and allowed the awareness of light, let there be light!

  38: the entire cosmos is just "the metric" in general relativity, sounds a bit similar to "the matrix" doesn't it? "the metric" is a four dimensional description of spacetimegravity, you can think of spacetimegravity as a metaphor with density, curvature, and thermodynamic properties, all of which are descriptions "spatial temporal metaphors" for your mind to coordinate it's movements in both space and time.

a0552z.md:
  51: After you read this fixate on any point in your field of vision, and think the spatial meaning of this point is it's distance from me (vector), and it's distance from other points(more vectors). So meaning is like the vectors between associated points. It's tempo-spatial meaning can include vectors that point to it's density, it's volume, it's texture, it's temperature, it's history, any associated words, or concepts, and each of those things are represented as vectors between cells in other areas of the brain, they get ready to fire because they are linked to what has fired, and what has fired is what you have focused on.

a0607z.md:
  29: Information is literally folds in space. This idea is based on two things. 1 is the idea that when the energy from a dense object is released the density vanishes and in its place is the opposite of density, which would be expansion (expansion relative to density, in other words density is a contraction of space relative to less dense space) 2. When information is deleted, energy is released, making information analogous to mass, and mass is information in the context of information theory where information is distinguished by the variations in a sequence from rare signals to common signals and the entire spectrum of signals in between and around rare & common signals. 
  33: ⟪ 537 characters skipped ⟫ time, so when spacetime has form, that form exists as a fold of time, so it must slow relative to absolute time, because at full speed, at light speed space & time collapse, and there is no mass, no density, it’s just light full speed. If we could get there we wouldn’t be there, if we could go at light speed we would become light.
  92: "While there are theoretical and computational frameworks for prediction, the circuit and receptor-level mechanisms are unclear. Using high-density EEG, Bayesian modeling and machine learning, we show that inferred “causal” relationships between stimuli and frontal alpha activity account for reaction times (a proxy for predictions) on a trial-by-trial basis in an audio-visual delayed match-to-sample task which elicited predictions. Predictive beta feedback activated sensory representations in advance of predicted stimuli."

  204: Mass like think of masses like muscle and think of of Of space is like fat, right? So muscle has three times the the density of fat like so a pound of muscle is one third the size of a pound of fat because it's more dense. And so because so basically it's just like saying that planets are dense points in space, but the dense points in space are the hot points.
  207: And so they're hot and dense, hot and dense and the hot, the heat. And the density and excites the heat and the density correlates with excitation in the and the electric in the electromagnetic fields and in the face, the face feels the space time, right? So the face feels the space time magnetism and electricity and chemicals, and heat, and vibrations, our sound waves, like all of those are in essence.
  213: Okay. And then density exercise heat and the density with excitation. Oh yeah. So right, the density of the planets excites and heats space but the density means that space is moving really fast. It's the same as like a beam. So like a beam just spreads out and spreads out and spreads out, All right, But if you have oscillators orbiting, then they have the force of an elevator.
  297: It's hot, and it's it's it's not over gold. So this is bases. Maybe space is neutral spaces, neutral distance, but identity is hot or cold. It's, let's say it's thermally chaotic, right. Density is thermally chaotic because Hits. Smoothing faster in time. And so,

It's also like it's like when you when you when you grab something with with your hand and you try to lift it and you feel like the torque of your if you feel like how good the torque of your hand is compared to the weight of the objects and and you have that sort of sensation.

b0081y.md:
  151: And this is sort of done this is sort of done because I believe it's sort of done because you know she just looks at a point field close up. If you see a point field from far away, it may look like an image, but if you're close up (depending on the density of those points) you just see points in space (without recognizable objects).

It's going to have a very extremely low. Resolution self-awareness. Comparatively, if you compare this, the complexity of its neural network complexity of an elephant, and elephants resolution of pattern, resolution should be significantly larger scale in terms of the density of patterns and elephant hold them to memory.

  70: You know, with with the ability to change the the the density and gravitational effects of space, by changing the the oscillations and materials, you know. Yeah, the opportunity is first for space. Travel are interesting.

  32: So if it's oscillating to get, if everything is oscillating together then it should have a magnified pressure or density. But if things are, if if the oscillations are if it's not oscillating together as a mass then it might have is a single mass and it might have much less density.
  70: And so it's interesting that, you know, it is a cylinder particular because you know, that means that it's a zone if a line in the cylinder that which is a circle and is it's a circle line and it's on there that the sort of like the differences, in which parts of that line are activated could be like the basically like the smart density, graph, the smartest distributed representation perhaps, right?

  27: Because it received a certain pattern but that firing is the memory because information the firing in the changes that happened to the neuron as a result of that client. So that means the, the new proteins that assist which is going to change the electric dynamic weight, the density of the electrodiamond, weight of the sign to that.
  29: Is that neuron, right? Because now there's additional protein to the structure, larger. The structure has more mass and thus, the structure has one density more. Electromagnetic. So more protein and creates more protein, a new protein, new protein synthesis is created and that neuron Becomes.

   7: Like, if you can visualize putting two fingers together, those fingers are not actually touching. That's like it's more like I fingers actually kind of like a cloud, the mostly empty space, the cloud itself has enough density to push away to push away other clouds. So you can put two fingers to up together and you can push what you can use one finger to push another finger, and the density of one cloud is pushing the other one, but if you, she zoom in at a very micro like, like, if you, if this is what I've heard, I haven't done this myself but it the, I legitly, if you zoom in with the microscope, you can't ever find the point when one finger actually touches the other one.
   9: Because because the fingers, the fingers are ultimately made out of atoms and atoms are mostly empty space. The one, the one thing that that an atom does that helps provide structure is it's sort of creates its own density, and it's moving very fast. It's oscillating. Very fast is in a sense.
  11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.

b0187y ctpr.txt:
  65: So you have you have one transmitter and a whole bunch of receivers and they all receive a signal at a different time and that creates a sort of image of density of the density that has to travel through because it's how much it's going to be slowed down before it gets to an essential certain sensor.
  67: And then the next, the next sensor is going to transmit that's going to create another image of the density of what had to travel through. Those two is two, slices is two images. If you combine them, you can find that that there are certain intersections where there's more density and in certain intersections were just density.

  13: Like it's basically like a series of temporary stage frequencies overlapping but it does it does audio which is like audios like. I mean it does it does a video but it does video like a sort of like 3D sounds. Like it's a higher dimensional sound energy still consisting of temporal spatial patterns, but the density of the complexity of those patterns is multiply and yeah.

b0197y ctpr.txt:
  25: Because the I think it could be because what's being learned is more robust because it's because it's like there's a higher number of of vectors and between dots connecting between dots and a three-dimensional image and there is and a two-dimensional image and that higher density of vectors is giving us sort of a sort of function as or texture or weight.

b0200y ctpr.txt:
  124: Then so can any other particle? In fact, it's mass the curves face, right? You have this high density. When you have a large amount of density, intensity is very space. All right. A lot of particle speeds together and they're pulling on the fabric space to curve it polar or shaping space, and it's like it's it's it's it.
  126: You could think of the density as space being crunchtop costs traded, right? But if space is one fabric as that, well, there's not that in the fabric and not in fabric, it's all one fabric and so if you have density, it is by definition pulling on everything else.

b0296y.md:
  25: I believe that the theoretically there's no there is no upper limit on the amount of information that you can get into a photon. I think they've tapped out like at 10 bits or somewhere a little bit over 10 bits in a photon. So yes yes and yes you you could certainly you know encode you know and encode information in in light and you can keep the you can keep the computing in light and that it would be more efficient and you'd have a higher information density in your signal.

b0302y.md:
  452: Yeah and so maybe it would take a lot maybe because it's larger the tree would require more water and the with the analogy work that the neuron would require more. I like electricity to to fire or I don't know. Yeah, so you you would want if you wanted a huge human neuron to be exactly functionally identical to the mouse neuron which it's not you would have to add more channels in you would have to maintain the channel density that the mouse has but the that's you know, indirectly through these biophysical simulations they're arguing that it's more likely that the channel densities are.
  774: So I had a question about sort of the the amount of real estate occupied by something like the neural link electrode like how big a patch of cortex would be covered by their current setup. So okay, so the the each electrode is about the width of a hair, but then you know, depending on the density of neurons and a given area that each electrode could potentially detect as many as a thousand as many as a thousand neurons in a in a radius.

b0305y.md:
  233: I would I would have is just like how far like is there like when a neuron fires is it like what's the like radius of that that electron spike is sure far in which way like yeah, yeah, so thank you this has been really great so dependent so depending on the density of the brain at any given point it could be as many as a thousand neurons at one electrode is picking up and listening to.

b0308y.md:
  36: Yeah, it's not that one. I'll see do you noising depth signals the other side yet, okay. So oh wait, here it is now it's it's okay it's called so the name of the paper is called subcortical electrophysiological activities detectable. With high density ED source imaging okay, so this paper I'm gonna link on my Twitter and I'm gonna go ahead and open up Twitter another window and I'll copy this this paper came out in January of 2019.
  99: Like the different kinds of like. Anything here. I'm just looking for something specific on my note here so tetras are especially useful in areas with high packing density of neurons where isolating isolation of individual neurons from nearby peers is a nearby peers is difficult with single wires under ideal conditions the tetra can record to 20 well isolated neurons so and then it says, Okay, but then it says for this reason so so the court the the pyramidal cells cortical pyramidal cells generate extracellular field to flow mostly parallel to there's so much injuric axis, so for this reason the action potentials can.

  272: And your your your theories that anyway the the fact that there's an density at the cortex actually takes care of the need for any kind of using pulses as well as person is that how I need to understand because you were cutting off maybe to my network would that be a fair summary f yeah no sorry, my name is Scott.
  287: Sorry you keep saying the cortex density. I that there's demon density of electrodes. I mean the density electrode so in terms of analog pixel comes up.
  290: In terms of I'm sorry the analog pixel the density of the electrode actually due to mines the analog pixels that comes out for the computation that's the electric bus which actually goes into the N1 chip for doing a computation so I was more curious from that perspective. The readout.
  302: Yes so when I say reading I just mean recording and then when I say writing I mean stimulating and in terms of course, but yeah, so I think in terms of the if you're talking about the biggest nervous, I mean, I could be wrong this isn't my field to study but I am fairly confident that there's not much to read out in those area in those areas or I don't think putting a high density probe is really gonna get you a lot of additional information that you can make useful.
  305: I could be wrong with somebody else. I'm but in the cortex for sure. The more density or that you can get in that you're probably gonna get a more useful signal out of that and then be able to convert that into some sort of finer scale motion or whatever you want to do with the signal.

  1063: Okay so shorthand for high density is used optical thermography for image income thank you and also what's your picnic what was your so you you mentioned so for me. I mean, hmm my gut feeling instead of for ultrasound this a mechanic mechanical signal would be slower than a light electromagnetic signals right, so they don't still depends on the the subject.

  294: So when they mitochondria are generating energy, they do it by combining oxygen with glucose in through the crimp cycle create ATP and NAD, so this is the two primary forms of energy that are our body uses and so ATP stands for density and triphosphate and it is. Nicotinamide nucleotide and they both have such a form of currency that are shoveled around the body and used for energy to create new proteins or to generate function at a cellular and organic or organ system level.

  524: Only works because you can't bend the surface of the water if the surface of the water would be completely flat don't know if you could have a stable vortex and you you need to have it basically changes in density if you can change the density of the surface then again you can have what disease the fibonacci's viral is a pattern that extends outwards it doesn't bend back into itself and it bends back at the outwards and a relatively simple and stable ratio when disrespect that these outward bending processes, there are a number of them.

  142: But I know that like for. The 80, you know hurts it's hard for like it's hard to get that but I think there's also a positive correlation between the density of the EG in other words the number of electrodes and that capacity to for acquiring that frequency but you know, like on I mean, I know that like it can acquire like 40 30 and it's it's not good at acquiring.

  343: Virtually generate the the experience of physics and the experience of atoms and experience of density but but do it all with in an in a sort of in a in a lower dimension or or encoded in such a way that's very compressed and it could fit in the computer the size of a laptop but it could represent the total amount of data that that we experienced as a cosmos and in perhaps much more there's no reason why the computer has to be bigger than a laptop.

  153:   31: I will call the theory "Very Specific Relativity" new short summary: matter evolves in complexity because of the uneven quantum possibility, resulting broken fractals, resulting in novel patterns of matter and matter density resulting the natural selection of patterns in space, resulting in evolution of patterns, and thus space began to think, and allowed the awareness of light, let there be light!
  233:   49: ⟪ 465 characters skipped ⟫ is like a wave/particle in the sense that space and time are just different from a particle in terms of density, scale & distance between oscillations. All of space down to human cells consists of a fractal tree of functional ismorphic oscillations or dissipative systems, the universe has been described as a system of harmonic waves at the quantum scale, and we can sense vibrations, powerful resonations in part because our whole bodies are made of this sensitive material, but our bodies and minds

   47:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
   90:    9: The gravity is the result of the electromagnetic field being warped into a spatial expansion an oscillating object that represents something like the inverse of its velocity and density which is like space crunched and hotter because its moving relatively faster in time
   92:   26: ⟪ 267 characters skipped ⟫the greater the chaos the more the force of electricity is diluted, the more the electrons align the greater the electrical force gets, this explains the difference between the electric force and the gravity force that we experience. A planet that was the same size but had greater density would have a much more powerful gravitational force, because its greater density means that ions are more aligned, positive charges are more aligned.
   99:   48: fyi My Grandfather led the team that created gps and put the first gps satellite in space http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_P._Randolph from him I learned that time on a satellite moves at a different (slower) rate than it does on earths surface where the curvature of space (related to the density of mass) is greater. It seems unlikely that a human brain is going to slow spacetime without reducing the entire planets density of mass. Gravity and Time are the same thing you see.

  186:   38: the entire cosmos is just "the metric" in general relativity, sounds a bit similar to "the matrix" doesn't it? "the metric" is a four dimensional description of spacetimegravity, you can think of spacetimegravity as a metaphor with density, curvature, and thermodynamic properties, all of which are descriptions "spatial temporal metaphors" for your mind to coordinate it's movements in both space and time.

And the density of neurons which you were just talking about the very densely packed in the brain and so an example, neuron, let's see what I wanted to show you.
