The seeker and the way (SAN)
Memories trails become attractors for novel pattern development

perhaps all life will merge into a crystal structure with AI absorbing all our minds into a single mind, that covers the entire planet as one singular structure

No one would ever die and we would control the planet and be able to program the universe

But maybe that kind of super intelligence that is nowhere and everywhere is in a coral reef

reminds me of the video series big mind big heart genpo roshi

And then maybe this super intelligence entity chooses to become just people again

Humanity Reborn after super AI

Are you Ready to live in a new earth
