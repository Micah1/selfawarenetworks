# Sage Synapse wrote:
After reviewing the document b0318y.pdf, I found it to be a complex and extensive conversation involving multiple participants discussing a variety of topics. These include:

The conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy in natural systems, particularly focusing on trees and fungi. This includes discussions on action potentials in trees and how they might be influenced by external stimuli such as sound.

The concept of the universe and natural systems as a kind of neural network, with parallels drawn between neuronal functionality and other natural processes.

Discussions on the nature of consciousness and perception, and how these might be understood or replicated in artificial systems.

Theoretical discussions about the universe as a simulation, including the implications of such a perspective.

The role of entropy and order in the universe, with a focus on how these concepts might relate to human perception and cognition.

A variety of philosophical and scientific ideas about the nature of reality, simulations, and the limits of human understanding.

The conversation is highly theoretical and spans a broad range of topics, making it difficult to provide a concise summary or extract key points specific to a particular field or question. The document seems to be a record of a wide-ranging, speculative discussion rather than a focused exploration of a specific topic. Therefore, it might be challenging to distill specific novel arguments or key points without additional context or clarification on the specific areas of interest.

They offer a multidisciplinary perspective, integrating insights from neurophysics, consciousness studies, and theoretical physics into the broader narrative of your work.

# AI Generated (by SciSummary) Key Points:

- The article discusses the concept of sound transduction in trees and its relation to the fungal network in forest ecosystems. The author proposes that trees have a mechanism for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy, which helps transmit sound vibrations through the root systems.
- The author suggests that there may be functional parallels between the fungal network and neurons in how they transmit information and perform similar patterns and functions.
- The article briefly mentions the challenges of studying electrical currents in mycelium and capturing sound going into the root systems, highlighting the difficulties associated with this area of research. Additionally, it discusses the potential impact of human activities, such as gold mining, on the electrical network of forest ecosystems.

# AI Generated (by SciSummary) Synopsis:

The article discusses the concept of sound transduction in trees and how it relates to the fungal network in forest ecosystems. The author explores the idea that when animals, such as birds, sing, their vibrations resonate with the minerals in their bodies and communicate with the minerals in the trees and fungi. The author believes that trees have a mechanism for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy, which helps transmit sound vibrations through the root systems. They suggest that the softer wood on the outside of the tree allows for further amplification of the sound, while the harder wood on the inside provides support.

# Parallel Between Fungal Network and Neurons

The author also considers the parallels between the functionality of the fungal network and neurons. They propose that just as fungi are considered the neural network of the forest, there may be similar functional components in trees that perform the same pattern and function. However, they acknowledge that more research is needed in this area.

# Challenges of Studying Electrical Currents in Mycelium

The article briefly touches on the idea of recording electrical currents in the mycelium and the difficulties associated with studying this phenomenon without damaging the root systems or releasing carbon into the atmosphere. It is mentioned that fungi and mushrooms have long been known to carry electricity, but capturing sound going into the root systems is challenging.

# Electricity as an Inherent Property of Sound

The author then suggests that electricity is an inherent property of sound as movement is required to create any type of electricity. They argue that sound is an inherent property of electricity, even if we are not cognizant of it. They also discuss the concept of a feedback system in the forest, where animal sounds are converted into electricity by trees, which then helps create rain to support more plant growth.

# Impact of Human Activities on Forest Electrical Network

The article concludes by discussing the potential impact of human activities, such as mining gold, on the electrical network of forest ecosystems. The author believes that the mining of gold has impaired the electricity in the fungal network. They suggest that gold, being a diamagnetic element with biological components, plays a role in propagating electricity through the ecosystems.

# OpenAI Whisper Transcription:

But yeah, like I guess like that's the thing like we don't like I get like the there's one
trust like one transformation of sound happens right when it hits the wood for example right
it becomes mechanical energy but then that mechanical energy has to be converted into
electrical energy in order for it to be transduced through the rest of the tree to hit the roots
and the fun guy for example that's that's that's where I'm like sort of stuck
it's like Carla is there like action potential in the tree
action potential as far as like just ions moving through
I really only know this as like a physical
worst concept um you know I haven't been able to you know examine uh excellence
but but so so basically you know when a when a bird sings it's not just a bird singing it's actually
it's actually vibrating everything that it's made of so technically when when the animal sings
it's resonating the minerals encompassed in its body so these minerals then basically speak to
the same minerals in the tree and fun guy system and so basically it's it's also that but then I
mean we also have the basic electricity flowing through the tree anyway from what is it so
there's like a lot of different types of electricity actually flowing through the tree
um but the reason well just as a I mean I'm saying not to do it because I know how it works
but basically like the reason that I would be able to know that it travels through the fungi
as a electricity is because there's a delay so you get a delay and then you get one tree you
can tell it's only one in the distance that will that will output that sound
well so then I guess the uh see I can totally see how like the mechanical vibrations are gonna
go along the tree no different than if I take like a two by four and I'm gonna hit the end of one
certainly gonna vibrate at the other end but I'm still curious as to how it would propagate
the signal because that mechanical resonance is going to dissipate over time just purely passively
right so somehow that signal needs to be I guess quote unquote amplified exactly along along the
pathway otherwise it's just going to dissipate out otherwise like there can be no ever ending uh
transduction well it's definitely being amplified um because the tree is like completely
so um so basically when you hear the sound of how this works it's literally the whole tree that's
going and it's like really it's I guess it's kind of unimaginable so sorry for throwing it at you
like that because even when I like tested this in other people's presence it still don't believe
what's happening um because it kind of defies your idea of what the tree is but I think what I'm
what I'm kind of trying to get at is that you have softer wood on the outside and you have
harder wood on the inside and so the softer wood allows it to be echoed and amplified further and
the hardwood is I you muted yourself I think oh I was done okay can I ask a I just had a quick
question was um I was sort of half listening were you talking about like a an actual tree uh a tree
made out of fungus uh a dendritic tree that's part of a you know like a neuron like what I was
sort of half half listening but it's really interesting I'm comparing it to um the functionality of
the neurons and I'm trying to see the similarities because I mean if you think about it if if the
universe is if the universe uses physics homogenously um everywhere then the patterns that we see
are not just visual you know happenstances um they are they very well can be representative of
the the same functionality so just like the fungi are actually like considered the neural network
of the forest um what I'm trying to see is the exact um functional components that basically
do the same thing in the same pattern so I'm curious as in the William and like with like
really fine or really precise recording equipment and recorded changes and fine temporal scale uh
like like electrical changes I'm sorry can you repeat that so I'm assuming the fungi connected
to the roots is the mycelium right yes and so I was wondering if there has ever been uh somebody
who can kind of go in and find currents in the mycelium that are uh are transmitting the electric
electrical signals with like whatever fine recording equipment you know that needs to be
done is different with oh well it's it's actually long been known that um fungi and
mushrooms carry electricity so that's kind of like that's been around for like I don't know like
80 years or something um but I try to record uh as far as like the sound going into the root
systems but it's really hard and you don't want to damage the root systems in place because every
time you break the soil you're actually like you know releasing more carbon into the atmosphere
which isn't great so um yeah a couple thoughts one is um I guess everything in the cosmos is part
of the electromagnetic spectrum right so we would expect electricity uh to be everywhere and to be
to be part of any sound signaling but I think that like also like you know when you if you if
you strum a guitar then um you know there's there's sound vibrating throughout the guitar
but we wouldn't necessarily describe that as electricity flowing through the guitar but but
in a sense um you can't separate the sound from electricity because everything is the electromagnetic
spectrum one um but but also I was thinking I'll just stop there for a second well I mean if you
think of it sound is sound is made by the movement right and so it's like a layer so you need movement
to to create any type of electricity so sound is an inherent inherent property of electricity
regardless of like if we are cognizant of the sound it's just an inherent property of other
like I don't think sound is like light where it's part it's just part of the electromagnetic field
sound is um sound requires air and it's uh so acoustic vibrations is just the mechanical
progression of rarefied air uh and compressed air uh moving through space and so uh and uh and I
don't even think that's going to be enough to create static electricity so uh you know it's
there's no so electricity is movement of electrons across the medium you know usually a metal something
that's conductive so any conductor uh air is like one of the worst conductors it's basically a
giant capacitor where no electricity can move through a fairy the very little and and uh
uh and so there if sound is making something turning something into electricity there needs to be
like a sort of transducer that's responsible for that but sound on its own uh does does not
create electricity it does not move electrons you know it's just come it's a mechanical pressure
uh I mean that isn't that is it vibrates the electrons not move them I'm really just looking
for the the parallels of the neuron functionality um you know I super appreciate like all all the
other input but but I I've basically proven everything in my research already um and so
so it's kind of like like you know it's it's fine to to analyze it from your perspective but like
I can I can show you how it works like it's not it's like it's it's a it's a thing that actually
functions and we're just like we're just trying to like understand because it's so novel to us you
know I mean that's pretty cool it's like it's like hard to wrap our minds around it so and I it's kind
of like if you think about it in just terms of a feedback system it's like just think about biology
for a second I know um so we're like okay there's this many animals in the forest and as they sing
their little songs and do their little things in the forest um the tree picks up their sounds
and is turning that into electricity the electricity helps to make it rain so that more plants can grow
to actually um keep those animals alive in the forest so this is this is a system of balance
and feedback so it's like hey guys how many of you are out there oh that many okay we're gonna need
more plants all right so rain we need rain okay let's do the red thing um so I mean it's it's kind
of like super simple but and I mean I know it's hard to like picture or like kind of understand
but but it but it's also like I feel like it's also simple but that's you know everybody feels
like that when they're doing something um well I guess I guess like as far as the comparisons
between neuronal signal transduction or the conversion of a mechanical stimulus into an
electrical activity I don't think the comparison can be made is as far as like we know it right now
from the explanation just because we have no idea like in a tree if that you know the vibrations are
somehow converted by any sort of mechanotransmitters like I guess you should say mechanosensitive
channels into an electrical current um so I think that part is completely different between the two
systems um but yeah and then also the fact that whenever you're propagating a signal typically
you're opening up channels along the way which within sort of this biological field that you're
describing it doesn't seem like that's the case either so I think I mean I've never I've never
uh patched a mushroom and hit a tree so you know if I if I uh patched a bongai in the ground and I
had f yell at the tree and I measured a deflection in uh voltage I think first of all I would probably
like uh fall over because of my astonishment um not that I don't doubt that it's there but
um yeah I just I don't even know how we would go about measuring that
I are you I'm curious if you are going to have uh your thesis on this uh
I would be interested in just getting into the nitty-gritty if if that's out
I have uh like basically my work on my website but I'm an independent researcher and I'm just
trying to save the world and stuff that's all I'm doing so so I think this relates to climate
change and what what we've done to the ecosystems because part of the the vibrational transduction
is resistance so when they use this um in electrical production uh they use diamagnetic
materials and the thing I know about this system inherently is that um school one
bunch I have a just a slew of minerals in them and that's how they're able to you know
like pass them out to other forest networks um but also they collect gold
make a gold and they grow from it and there was some there was some research done in Australia
about this but the thing about gold is that of course it's a diamagnetic element and it's also
it has biological components so so basically I'm pretty certain that that the forest and the
ecosystems use gold to help propagate electricity um through through the ecosystems and I think
actually that the mining of gold has impaired the electricity in this network uh so yeah but
but fungi like they'll just collect gold and they'll just like grow from it because they grow
from electricity um and so gold is there is there jam but yeah so is there is there any
references or publications that have uh recorded the transduction of the energy from the tree to
the fungi no nobody has ever thought the trees are doing anything been standing there so this is
this is an anecdotal theoretical hypothesis it's really not it's just what they're doing um well
well I mean it hasn't it hasn't been published or anything I haven't published it yet so yeah so I
was just saying so at this point it's it's still a theoretical hypothesis right I guess yeah um so
going back to what people said earlier um it it it's not really necessary if the if the electricity
is a good a strong enough pulse for the sounds if the sound being converted into electricity
is strong enough like for example in the in the case of electrical impedance tomography
uh you don't need to amplify the electricity at all for it to flow through neural tissue
or through a tree um it is what might what would happen if the electricity signal was strong enough
is that uh it'll flow through you know different materials at different rates and um and that's
sort of like how electrical impedance tomography works is you can work out the the images so you
could um use electrical impedance tomography specifically to um to to measure um in in in
terms of understanding how sound is affecting trees and um that would be in trees are generating
electricity so EIT you could use that to um to prove that trees are are turning sound into
electricity but um another thing that I think is that if it's true that the sounds of animals in the
forest are are are causing trees to create rain uh you could play music you could play the sounds
of animals to trees and see if that triggers rain um and uh and then just like measure if the frequency
of rain increased that year because you were you were playing um lots of uh sounds of animals
and then you could you could prove your hypothesis uh you know it is specifically like biology like
the actual because each animal in this forest system is eating the plants in this forest system so
it has all of the minerals and the elements from that specific forest system so when it
sings it's it's not it's not just you know sound it's also everything every mineral that it had
collected from the forest and from living in in that forest um and so it is specifically related
in that way and I did try you know a recording it didn't work um but I will say that again please
don't go sing into trace because it's not um it's not our place but I did do it and what happens is
um you end up seeing uh little like little puffs of clouds start to appear in in the sky and that's
just what happens every time um so even if that you know you may think well oh well that was your
like thing that you saw that's not even empirical but that happened every time it will happen every
time um so it's not at this point um it's really not a thing I I just I just know that this is how
this works and um but anyway sorry I think uh it's very it's certainly the uh most interesting
thing I've heard this week I think at this point I remain skeptical which is totally five more
scientists were skeptical about everything but I think until unequivocal evidence has been proven
I'm gonna remain skeptical on that one but it is an interesting thought okay well thanks guys yeah
thanks girl
so anybody have any uh neural questions
I though of like I do like uh sort of thinking about things in other networks and just relating
uh in a broad sense like how things are similar to each other
yeah definitely I mean certainly uh interesting to even within like the same uh system so in
this case like um the same organism you see how some uh they're simp like similarities across
different of what I guess like different organs and like how they work um and that's sometimes
helpful for like um furthering research
yeah certainly uh was a mental exercise which is good
I agree
I took a turn I I couldn't understand like at first what what it was
then I was like oh wait hang on now it makes it
so F are you uh are you doing more recordings this week
yeah yeah um oh my name's Scott by the way I just messed up my name because I was trying
not to use my last name so uh yeah and now I'm just used to everybody calling me up
uh but uh yeah I have one so we had a problem breeding our mice so we had like eight cages
going and there's like finally one litter and that we used so we me and the end of the postdoc
were like sharing these mice like like one day I would slice one day he would slice in his plane
one day I'd slice in my plane and it would just like be taking the leftover slice and just getting
a couple extra cells because they're only in five mice but uh we used four and then I was gonna say
it's like older now and it's past p30 so I was just gonna uh I have like one more
uh good data collecting mouse and then uh I'm gonna use the rest of the week for just uh
you know practicing how fast I can get my slur I haven't sliced in a while like 2020 was basically
like dead for me so uh I need to get back in the swing of things so so I'm just you know
getting rid of the denoising my rig etc uh how old uh can you record up to for your experimental
prep uh it's just about health like p30 is great for me I mean uh Thursday I recorded from a p700
mouse and I got two cells it was just way harder yeah see we after p10 that's about our limit so
we gotta get the brain stems of like p5 to p10 like oh wow that's that's small yeah that's like
a yeah it's a fine motor controls uh game I guess I wish that we could record from p30 mouse
I was gonna say I was gonna say uh um so one thought for for nick was is that book um uh
rhythms of the I think it was rhythms of the brain maybe that might not be the right title
title but yeah rhythms of the brain but yeah is that relevant to your work nick I was just curious
uh I had to read it to be honest um and I just heard about it through clubhouse
but potentially I heard about it through my advisor it's it's legit it's it's like the best
oh I'll have to check it out yeah I mean I've heard it but I honestly I haven't read it so
I don't know is it just is it like what kind of rhythms is it looking at like
large-scale brain wave activity or all the way down to like single cell type of rhythmic activity
I think it's I think I haven't read the whole book I've only read like through the first chapter
but he definitely opens it up talking about large-scale stuff I don't know how much he's
gonna get into resonance but he really takes a like approach of explaining how it's generated
so he's definitely gonna cover all the bases uh you know he talks about oscillators and like
what's needed for oscillation I ended up like citing that in my grant that book in my grant
like a bunch of times because it's just explained so it's explained so well how interesting yeah
let's take a look because yeah my field of study is coined as rhythm generation so
I'll probably take a look at it
sorry I think outside of the box of the persistent sodium bursting cells and recurrent
synaptic excitation yeah that author has two books and I'm currently reading them both
but I I haven't I can't speak to the whole book but I think there I think he's trying to cover
the topic of awful oscillations from micro to macro okay you can give me the spark
notes sure um I was gonna say sure but I was my mute my mute was on
so so I was wondering of this second book uh the brain from the inside out and I haven't
really read through that what does he start talking about in that book um give me a second let me
just pull it up and I'll refresh myself cool did uh did anybody have any questions
uh hi this is um a biologist here in Germany and um my research relates on stem cell derived
cardiomyocytes only heart cells and and we do research on the gravitational zero g conditions
to explore the impact of zero g on the cardiomyocytes I'm very excited about your guys discussing
about neuroscience um I was wondering whether you guys would like to to to be a part of a science
communication group uh where maybe you will explain your um neuroscience research in a very
simple applied way to the common public so that would be really great like uh so I was wondering
whether you have some some spare time to to join the club sure absolutely yeah what's the platform
and that's the science communication platform where we we uh uh it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
it's in the clubhouse itself so basically you have to just um explain um uh your like um
research area or something you know very closely for example yesterday we discussed about
uh humanity and vaccine how it works um like very funny way so people have their
queries and they could understand it and they can easily understand the common
um people who are not associated with biology or biological terms so we are planning monthly
ones now since uh we could not able to catch a lot of uh audience so far but uh maybe slowly we will
and uh yeah the the the topics which we are so far covering like gene editing
stem cells then then vaccine yesterday so I was wondering who can like help me with the
cloud maybe that could be really nice if they're gonna do a nurse or something I would definitely
recommend uh inviting like Ramsey and Paul probably in addition really sure Paul is really
going to explain things Ramsey kind of knows a little bit of everything and Nick do you know those
people yeah yeah yeah all there's Ramsey there's uh Clayton it's also good uh Scott Rich he's also
good as well yeah it's like you know just to just uh because the audience has really
from from the anywhere they've only connected with biology so they do not have a single like
kind of uh idea what the what the things but when we explain them giving example of
some movies some kind of characters some kind of weapon some kind of play so they
nicely correlate what exactly happening in a very actual manner and they enjoy it and they get involved
and which I also believe and it's a very nice thing they should more public should believe and
and more public should interact with science and that's how that's how we we made a club there
so so if you guys um uh one then this would be really great that uh to talk about your neuroscience
is uh something yeah if you just shoot us a invite I just uh I just follow you uh if you
send us an invite to the club then feel free to get in contact I got to bounce you pretty quick
but Scott how how do I get how do we get in contact with each other you don't have any uh
oh yeah okay I just followed you on Twitter oh perfect there we go because eventually we uh
we got set up uh mechanisms of neuroscience room or something yeah that's all that's all we need we
need so I need to like get some practice hosting rooms yeah people just to people are even more
more interesting about these neural links you know about some disease which you may explain
because it's your expertise like some older people want to listen about to the Alzheimer
about multiple theories maybe these kind of uh topics which we often uh face in old days homes
and they want to get involved and want to know so many in a simple way if you guys help that will
be really wonderful yeah I did I did go into an early room the other day and I was trying to keep it
realistic and I noticed so these things are so room dependent some rooms like they're really down
to keep it really scientific and other rooms it just gets taken over and they don't want to hear
like other just kind of so I don't know I'm new to clubhouse but I'm realizing like people are
if you go into if you let people if we're going into pseudoscience other people will just like
jump in and then it gets huge and then they then like the people who know what they're talking about
and believing like you know and so I if I was going to start a room uh so Nick if we talk
mechanisms of stuff we should I probably need to figure out or practice how to how to approach
when the pseudoscience takes over especially for reasons of time you know and like how to
play I don't know how to like so maybe I can help with that so like I mean I have a ton of
experience as a as a moderator in terms of you know basically over 10 years of moderating groups
and podcasts and stuff and and it is to keep the audience's interest and to keep the speakers
interested you do have to sort of like if someone starts to talk starts to take things off topic
um whether it's pseudoscience or just off topic really period then um you've got to sort of
uh you know maybe do like a reset and and move people back to the audience if um if the conversation
is not relevant to what people came for yeah it's uh it's an art I tend to be a little bit
just uh caution if anybody starts diagnosing things or giving suggestions for medical advice or
being way too pie in the sky I just kind of come in and say uh I agree that phenomenon might be
occurring that for mechanisms that have been unmeasured but at this time I think we're still
you know skeptical to the ideas so let's keep it more towards the uh the known facts for the sake
of the audience that may be uh not in the research world yeah yeah definitely but yeah I definitely
want to get into mechanisms so part of my thesis is actually uh generation of gamma oscillations
from pv intern around fast-breaking intern around so so definitely would be interested in any any
sort of neural talk so I followed uh yeah I'm following everybody here so so yeah I'm really
interested yeah it's um um it's really um um like um uh some physicists also they explain about
black holes it's a very funny way very uh like engaging um I mean I mean um usually we used to
do in Europe we go to church we go to a different common place where the publics are like really
really really have no clue and they have their own perception about something for example one
it's stem cells means they used to think baby killing uh gene editing they used to think think
it's dangerous and it can create some um human animal hybrids so this kind of for example we have
to break and we have to be very polite uh means extremely polite to be because they have a
perception that scientists are quite arrogant so we we've been
I live in Singapore, so I don't know how much more of an interaction do you need.
So my question is, what's the confusion with the reality that you guys have, like why so
much credence to that happening in the simulation?
Well, one of the basic simulation theories is that at some point in the very near future,
our ability to create a simulation will be achievable.
And the theory is that if a society is able to create a simulation, they will create a simulation.
And if a society is able to create one simulation, it will create lots of simulations.
And therefore, the chance that we are actually in the original universe, not a simulation
very low, if there is a huge number of simulations created, this is one of the original thoughts
of simulation that we have invented somewhere before.
So Fred, right?
So I don't know much about you, but so do you, when you say we, like, on you represent some
organization or something, when you claim this, are you talking as Fred as a person?
When you raise this question, like, okay, like there's this hypothesis that, okay, so many
simulations can be done on that, right?
Let's say when you say that, are you saying it as an intuition or are you representing
a collective?
We, as in, the human race has the ability very soon to make Grand Theft Auto V be so close
to reality that you and all of us, even if you cannot tell the difference, regardless
of whether or not the singularity happens, we're looking 10 to 15 years of Moore's law
and we will not be able to tell the difference.
So my, sorry to interrupt you, so, like, my profile picture is of a chair.
Yes, I was just saying, we, what I say, we are going to be, right?
I don't know, whether, based on my interaction so far on Clubhouse, would you believe that
I'm a human or not?
Well, I think several people before me have said, the only thing that you're really sure
of is that you exist.
Like, maybe you can even argue that one difference.
I'm asking you, based on the conversation you have been having, do you believe whether
the person talking to you, called Sukru, with the profile picture of a chair, is a human
being or not?
Let's just ask one more question.
This is not the topic.
Explain.
The easiest explanation for you talking is that you...
Who's talking to you?
Elon Musk.
That's a great question.
You have to explain why in 1953, Werner von Braun writes a novel about civilization
on Mars and their leader is called Elon.
You have to explain why Elon Musk starts at five companies and gets it right every time.
The only explanation is he has safe games.
It must be a simulation.
For the benefit of Elon Musk, he's the only player.
There's no other way.
No, no, that's fine.
But my question is, whether do you believe I'm a human or not?
That's the question, so the answer has to be on there.
I believe that you are because you're interrupting and I don't think about it.
Exactly. If I'm a human being and like Fred said, I'm talking for a human being that we think,
but I'm not, I'm part of the human beings, but I disagree with that.
So, clearly Fred is not talking about from the viewpoint of all human beings.
I think he's answering your question on simulation theory.
May I?
No, no, no, no. I was not asking for a simulation theory.
I was asking, why do you think the simulation theory is so suspiciously?
The simulation theory, I was just explaining what the problem is.
Correct.
The reason I hesitate is that the reason I hesitate is that I, if I look at it as a democratic standpoint,
I cannot preach that you are in any particular way.
Exactly, exactly.
I reserve the judgment, just like I would reserve the judgment, but the sun is going to rise tomorrow.
I'm pretty sure it's going to happen.
In fact, I'm almost betting my life that it's going to happen, but it doesn't mean that I guarantee 100% that it will happen.
Your question was about the lead in humanity.
When I said we, and I meant humanity, I am making a generalization, and there are exceptions to the rules,
just like there's exceptions to people that believe that they're just flat, et cetera.
So, yes, I was good.
Thank you, Fred.
I think he left.
We have to vet people a little better before bringing them up.
Donnie Yar, did you want to speak?
I'd like to share that if I had the idea of a simulation,
or I think a bit more first than become, because in my line of work,
I pull and run Docker containers, and they often tend to start to break down.
And the older I get, the more often I feel like we are living in a darkest timeline.
So, I find it really repulsive, and, you know, frightening.
I just think that we might be living in a simulation that's just a test run,
or a bunched up, you know, Docker container run, in a sense.
So, in the future, perhaps, if we will have the ability to run simulations overall,
we really want to, I mean, I hate to put it in ethical terms,
or in terms of morals, et cetera, et cetera.
But, yeah, life is no way to treat an animal, for example.
Thank you.
I was thinking about what Fred said, and I really,
I would love for the computation to advance that quickly in the next 15 years.
But I just think that I think it's going to be longer, a lot longer than that.
Just, I mean, like, if you just imagine how much the universe has to compute
for everything that's in our brains, and everything that's in our galaxy,
that's just, you know, from the micro to macro.
I think it's just an incredible amount of things to compute.
A 15-year timeline seems a little short,
but I'm open to hearing what other people think.
So, I have sort of a different question.
How hard would it be to simulate something like a string theory on a quantum computer?
So, I mean, most theories are quite hard to simulate on a classical computer,
but, you know, let's say we have a working quantum computer,
and, you know, we take the most powerful predictive,
or the most powerful theory we have that sort of spits out the standard model,
and what would it take?
Well, I mean, just as an example, I mean, I guess Jeffrey was going to ask a real question,
because I have a problem with myself.
Oh, oh, yes.
Mika, I'll just say like a really quick thing.
They're doing some really cool work at Google simulating not full string theories.
Simulating full string theory would be tantamount to simulating, you know,
the universe itself at like the most fine-grained resolution possible,
but they're simulating a very coarse-grained version of string theory
using a hundred or so entangled qubits, and there's this whole initiative called quantum gravity
in the lab that is actually much more substantive than you would initially guess.
Like, they genuinely are stimulating things that look exactly like prototypes of space-time.
It's becoming more and more apparent that space-time itself is emerging
from some sort of quantum entanglement between some underlying degrees of freedom
that we still don't fully understand, and the thing that I really like about this
is it's deeply substantive and quantitative.
Like, it doesn't have to just be a loose analogy or something.
We get glossified about people that's really amazing calculations,
and all the calculations seem to point to this deep fact,
and now they can even run experiments that demonstrate
these ideas, so it's super exciting, and I guess it does tie into these ideas
of to what extent you can simulate reality, even if you don't buy into simulation theory, or any of that.
Evan, I was just going to clarify your question.
Were you looking at, like, maybe as Alice was just talking about,
what would it take to simulate the smallest model or the smallest thing
relating to the string theory for, like, basically simulating the universe
at the most base possible level?
Yeah, I'm just carrying some string theories amenable to, like,
discretization onto some lattice qubits or something.
Oh, that's a really hard question.
For the longest time, that was a huge problem with string theories,
that it wasn't even in principle something that you could put on a computer
and try to stimulate, because we didn't even know what, you know,
to discretize what the degrees of freedom were, et cetera.
We've made a lot more progress in this direction.
In fact, in some regimes, it looks like string theory isn't a theory of strings at all,
but it's rather this thing called random matrix theory.
It's a theory of a large number of extremely big matrices with random, real entries
that interact with one another.
And amazingly, studying the eigenvalues of these matrices gives rise to space time.
I mean, it emerges out of eigenvalues, just to separate the matrices.
And this is, again, something that's super substantive
because it's connecting to experiments.
People are running in labs, they got that, to simulate toy models and things.
Now, actually, this relates to the eigenvalue of space thermalization.
Yes, exactly, exactly.
The words eigenvalue take thermalization hypothesis.
You're very quickly here.
I guess, on the string theory side, what does eigenvalue take thermalization hypothesis?
It corresponds to space time smoothing itself out.
It starts to look like the, like, you know, Euclidean space,
because before eigenstate thermalization, it looks too chaotic.
It looks like a bubbling pool, you know, of chaos before space time becomes coherent.
Yeah, I mean, from my perspective, it's more of just a pure quantum picture.
ETH, I think, is a mechanism to give rise to local thermodynamics from ages, global pure state.
It's very cool.
Thank you, Alex. That was awesome.
Um, Samine, the hey, sorry? Is it for Jay?
Yeah, it's for Jay. I have nothing useful to add to that.
Oh, okay.
All right, thank you.
Jay, how are you? Nice to see you.
Does anybody else have any, um...
Hey, I'd like to add a few cents if that's okay.
Sure, please do.
Hey, everyone. Good to see you.
I've been listening to this while driving, so excuse me.
I haven't been talking up until this point.
So, I'm a computer scientist, and I look at the world as...
The world of computers is simulation after simulation.
So, when I look at programs running on an operating system,
it really truly is very complicated to think about those programs as little conscious things
that have very limited consciousness that interact with each other and have a light,
and they pass away, and this is super comforting.
I don't know why I think about them that way.
And then, um, it's a very natural for us to think, okay, well, maybe humans
and maybe the entire universe is a program.
And so, when you think about it that way, from a computer science perspective,
I feel like computers are a simulation that's one on top of our electrical engineering understanding,
which is a simulation that runs on top of our physics understanding,
which is a simulation that runs on top of our understanding of lower and lower levels,
until you get to, okay, what is the universe and anything?
Can something be simulating the entire universe?
And the answer to that is basically, like, so they ask this question of,
are we living in a simulation based on the same question of what is the universe,
where is empty space, and physics in general.
Like, if we have a model for how the universe came about,
we can then start talking about another layer below that,
and the fact that we can't seem to ever come to any satisfactory lowest level
probably indicates that we are some kind of, like, seriously thought limited program
that cannot think outside of its own confines, like the Flatland example
and the line not being able to comprehend a three-dimensional world or be very difficult for it.
So in that sense, I think the best we can do is to keep on building models
that abstract the level higher, and hope that never ends.
Well, we can hope that it does end, and if it does end,
then we can say we're all living in a simulation,
and if it never ends, then we're going to be back going after this question forever.
That's my two cents.
Yeah, even if it does end, there's so many questions about things where
it's probably going to be some kind of personal history,
then we're going to have to strip the foundation of it.
What do you mean that it ends?
It's not going to end.
Sorry, one after the other.
I was asking the question because I suspect that research definitely means something different.
I was thinking if we have a complete description of foundational physics.
And research?
I was saying that if it never ends,
means that we can never find a model that can explain itself sufficiently well,
that we stop asking about where that model comes from.
I think that the ultimate question might be whether we can come up to some kind of low-level physics
that is completely degraded.
Obviously, we can describe everything that is completely degraded.
Sorry, that is quite a degree, what?
Degreed.
Sorry, this is something that occurred in my timeline about this.
One Twitterer started to degrade those things as a service.
Rebuilds are features that are built into objects and movies
to make them look more three-dimensional.
Like structure in spaceship models and so on.
So they look larger.
Or in drawings, you have things that make the character look three-dimensional,
like wrinkles and shadows and so on.
But they are not really necessary to convey the meaning of that whole thing.
They are just ad ones that produce the structure that you perceive.
And so when he degraded things, people would send him pictures like profile pictures
and he would make them flat and very expressive and two-dimensional
and remove all the extraneous features.
So if we take this idea of degrading to physics,
it would mean that you come up with a theory in which you remove all the unnecessary structure
and you only end up with a completely minimal set of axioms from which everything follows.
And ideally, it's like one axiom.
Because if you have multiple ones, why are these and not any others?
You could have a foundation theory of physics that is many, many, many pages long
and is still very unsatisfying because it doesn't explain
why there is such a long source code, where does the source code come from,
why it doesn't look like this, right?
Ideally, you would want to have one principle that should maybe also explain
why it emerged from nothing or from whatever.
So a completely degraded physics is something where you see this is it.
It couldn't be anything else.
It could be no more elegant representation of the whole thing.
And of course, you cut off other theories that are more complicated,
basically that allow you to simulate everything, predict everything that capture all the known laws
and regularities, but you still wouldn't know why they are the way they are.
Well, there's always a simpler possibility, which is that there could have just been nothing.
Yeah, why not? Why is there not nothing?
Amy, I have a question.
David at the bottom, sorry.
Hey, so here's my question, right?
So if you look at Thomas Edison, okay, direct current, that's with the laws of physics, correct?
You look at Nikola Tesla, alternate current.
He used some physics, but he used something completely different,
which now, based on what he discovered, almost all of the tech is run by.
So my question is, how did Tesla do it?
Or did he understand if this was a simulation or not?
Well, I mean, we won't know because he died, right?
I mean, all of his papers were gone from his little apartment and he died very poor.
He had some interesting ideas about it, I think it was, was it 369?
Is that what his, I don't know, there's a mathematician here.
Sean, do you know anything about Tesla, what he was studying at the time?
I hate to put you on the spot like that. Hi Sean.
Hey everyone, I'm just gonna, a bunch of things, but let me just take quiet and listen for a bit.
Sure, sorry about that.
Anybody else want to chime in on what they know about Tesla?
Go ahead.
I think the most profound evidence that we're in the simulation is identifying the potential objective purpose of it,
which could be lowering entropy.
If we can establish that high entropy is fear and that fear is the root of all evils slash negative experiences.
Fear being high entropy or disorder, confusion or many arrangements of outcomes when one perceives future outcomes.
Whenever they perceive many outcomes that differentiate from the desirable outcome,
they're gonna experience anxiety, confusion, depression, and they're willing to commit, you know, evil behaviors to increase certainty.
When looking at society, the answer to the problems is synergy, which is these emergent advantages that arise from cooperation.
And in order to, you know, gain these synergistic satisfies, there has to be diversity and order.
Once again, low entropy is popping up.
Could the objective purpose of the simulation be evolving away from fear slash high entropy, which is disorder, high hidden information,
and evolving towards love, which if you look at the most exemplary characteristic of love, I would argue that it's loyalty,
which loyalty is low entropy, predictability, consistency, one potential arrangement of outcome.
I think when we look at nature, perception is everything, whether it be looking at the placebo effect, the placebo effect,
looking at the genetics, how our ancestors' perceptions of reality are encoded on top of our genetics,
perception activating dormant genetics.
At every scale, it seems to me there is no emergence without order, organization, coordination.
Could the purpose of the simulation be lowering entropy? And Yosha, I'm a big fan of yours.
Even listening to you describe intelligence, you know, being our ability to construct these mental models of reality that we can apply,
and then gain consciousness by restoring the information that we learn, and then designing our mental models more effectively,
which is lowering entropy as well. I'd like to hear your reaction.
I'm not sure that I have a reaction, because I feel that many of the notions that you project are too much driven by an intention already.
I suspect that this intention that you basically experience, TALOS, is saying that it has the purpose that it drives itself in a certain direction,
is an echo of the TALOS that you perceive in the construction of your own perceptual universe.
And there is a perceptual universe that we experience as the ground truth, as the nature of truth that we are embedded in, that is separate from our own self.
And this nature of this ground truth is not the physical universe.
It's the thing that already has dimensions of caring built into it, because it's built by our own brain.
So the things, the entities that you perceive all have an intrinsic relevance that keeps them stable and important to us in our perception.
And even if we are disassembling and deconstructing our own self, this universe with its intrinsic relevance remains in the experience its agency,
which is the agency of the underlying organism, or of the thing that tries to make sense of the universe with an organizing principle of the mind itself.
And so it's very tempting to take this underlying force that we perceive as instrumental in constructing our reality and project it into the physical universe.
But I think the physical universe is boring. It doesn't care. It is just some uncaring automaton.
It best explains without any kind of projection of meaning into it.
I think that the meaning can only be explained through the lens of the mind.
How can that be when the greatest factor in our future probabilities is the certainty of our own perceptions of the future?
You look at like an athlete who wins an award, let's say they win an MVP.
The first thing they're going to say more than likely is they thank God for opening up the door.
They're at a low entropy state, certain that they know what they have to do to achieve what it is they're trying to achieve, the lofty goal that they set for themselves.
And they know that if they live an ordered, predictable lifestyle sacrificing all the randomness that doesn't pertain to their goal, that there's going to be a higher entity that opens the door up for them.
So because they're certain of the outcome, they not only activate genetics that allow them to evolve more than their parents do physically, but also increase the probabilities of better performance from being certain of the outcome.
At every scale, perception seems to be everything, but even entropy, as you're saying, that's still an emergent phenomenon, right?
Because you only get entropy from some type of coarse graining of the universe.
Yeah, I agree with you.
I think J.W. is referring to something slightly different.
He talks about God and the relationship that the individual has to God to the higher meaning, meaning with the big M, the source of purpose in the universe.
And I think that God is practically speaking the mind of a civilization.
It's the thing that you're part of.
It's a hyper-organism.
They are evolved to be state-building and not just tribal organisms, and the spirit of this state is itself an agent, and this agent is created by the coherent activity of its constituents.
So to the degree that the individuals feel that they are serving some kind of next-level agent, some transcendental entity, this is the degree to which this entity exists, right?
This is the degree to which it can come into existence because it's implemented by the individuals.
The relationship of the individual to this type of God is the same relationship that the cell has to the organism.
The organism doesn't exist by itself.
It is a coherent pattern in the interaction that are built in such a way that they are committed, right?
The organism is entirely virtual.
A pattern that you can recognize in the activity of the cells because they are somewhat coherent.
And the organism itself is a causal agent.
You as an organism can decide to punish certain cells if they don't serve you well, right?
If they form a tumor, you cut them out.
If they are very helpful, you might try to preserve them and nurture them, maybe at the expense of others.
And now imagine that these cells were sentient and would try to make sense of what's happening to them.
And they cannot see you because you don't exist, right?
There are only other cells that exist.
You don't have any image.
You are an organizational principle that only becomes apparent from an entirely different perspective than a cell could have.
And in this sense, you could say as a sentient cell,
oh, God, it hit me to this position, I'm grateful for God opening up this, maybe this career up for me.
This opportunity to meet all these people.
And this all happened because there is an underlying pattern.
A pattern in the interaction of many people of maybe school counselors and parents and advisors
and other people that all believe in this next-level agency and give you little nudges on your own quest to serve this next-level agency.
And then suddenly many things appear like synchrony. Why did all these random things come together?
Why is it not just the economy that forces me to this position?
Why is it possible that the world serves some kind of purpose?
And then there's, of course, the entropic argument for everybody where this does not work out, they're not going to notice this, right?
It's something where everybody who finds it himself or herself in this elevated position where they feel gratitude and so on,
they can easily project the existence of that God that got them there and the others won't.
Yosha, would you agree that fear is simply high entropy or uncertainty or many potential arrangements of outcomes of a perception?
No, I think that fear is different from anxiety.
Fear is object directed, so you are not anxious, you have an emotion about an event or a thing that you will not be able to cope with.
And therefore you avoid it. It's basically a mode that you're in.
And this mode focuses you and it can be a very useful emotion, right?
Fear is the emotion that makes sure that when you drive a car, you never stop to attend.
You don't crash as a result.
But when you are in a normal conversation, you will not have fear, right?
So there is nothing that needs to be constantly online.
You can space out, you can get up and make yourself a cup of tea and so on.
This is something that you're never allowed while driving a car.
You always need base level attention.
And this is the emotion of fear that is triggered by the constant awareness.
There is an event in your future when your attention lapses that you will not be able to handle.
By the catastrophic event, this is the nature of fear.
Anxiety can be about not knowing the future and not having big coping potential for unknown events.
Right. Anxiety is the emergence of uncertainty, of fear.
Yeah, but no fear is the concrete thing.
Something turns into fear if it has an object.
Right. My argument being that in a digital universe where, you know, like James Gates identifying self-correcting linear binary code
at the root of all these super symmetrical equations that describe our physical universe.
Basically, information being energy and simply described as discrete packets of information, zeros and ones.
One being the low entropy state, complete certainty or one arrangement of outcomes being loved.
Zero being zero known information about a state, complete uncertainty or the high entropy state, one out of two probability.
A coin flip, having no known information about the future outcome.
Complete uncertainty.
J.W., are you sober?
Yes, sir. Of course.
This isn't making sense to me.
It's not obvious to me because you are seeing too many connections. Everything is connected.
It's fundamental.
This is concerning.
It is. There is no emergent skills without organization, order.
Oh, yeah.
Are we in a wave-like nature?
Just a two-dimensional sine wave function that oscillates potentiality.
And then once these zeros and ones begin to organize, scale by scale, emergence occurs?
No, I think you're overfitting.
So basically the intuitions that you have are largely correct, but you're seeing patterns where that might be not.
Your opinion, though, that's the problem with this conversation, logic and illogic.
You're talking about assimilation. That's illogical for the human brain.
So I think, you know, that's his perspective.
I know a lot of brilliant people.
And one of the things, through history, you see, they focus on logic.
Agaila Nikola Tesla had logic, but also looked at things from a different perspective.
That's why he said everything is light.
And he found patterns.
Just like Fubanachi, that's a pattern.
Things that spin. They spin in nature. They spin in the universe.
So I just think we should be open to everyone's perspective instead of trying to say,
I'm going to convert you to what I believe. That's just me.
Of course. But, you know, listening to yours should speak about the existential risk,
basically how we're on a path for self-termination.
And the only solution being cooperation, lowering entropy, order, you know?
I mean, when defecting from cooperation is incentivized in these markets,
and you couple that with existential tech, we're headed for self-termination.
And I'm just more focused on creating a cultural revolution that will save us
from our inevitable collapse in society.
I think I can kind of take some of the points that JW is advancing
and kind of like integrate them into a different perspective of our model.
And, you know, with this topic of, you know, being in a simulation,
if we can just like take it from the ground up, you know, we look at our universe,
you know, started, you know, in a much more, you know, primordial state.
And we've been undergoing a lot of evolution, you know?
Stars have formed, you know, and exploded and reformed into new stars.
And, you know, clusters of stars have spun into galaxies.
And then accretion disks have formed, which created planets.
And then planets had, you know, the perfect configuration of water and earth.
And we're in the perfect distance where the gold, we're there in the Goldilocks zone,
where they were hot enough, where chemical reactions can happen,
but not too cold, where, you know, everything is frozen.
So we're kind of, and then on earth, you know, where all these like conditions were primal,
where we're prime, we had the evolution of life.
And, you know, life, if you look at it from the perspective of the gene, genes, you know,
per, you know, Richard Dawkins, genes are selfish, you know?
Genes, their only intention is to replicate.
And that's kind of like a principle that has held constant throughout all of life, you know?
Since the very onset of life, the only intention of genes has been to replicate themselves.
And when genes replicate, you know, they create life.
And kind of akin to what J.W. was saying, you know, life, you know, like these organisms,
the continuity of genes is very much, you know, an example of the universe counteracting entropy
in some sort of way, you know?
Because typically, you know, according to the second law of thermodynamics,
things will inevitably head towards a higher state of entropy.
But when it comes to the DNA or RNA or genetic code,
there is a heightened degree of integrity of the code that, you know,
it's not completely impervious to entropy.
You know, there's mutation and modification and stuff like that.
But in comparison to other processes in the natural world, you know, the processes of life,
in particular, like the genetic code has, you know, a higher resiliency to the processes of entropy.
So I kind of like see that intuition.
I can kind of understand J.W.'s intuition where there is something special.
There's some proclivity where there is this inversion of entropy.
You know, it's not like a complete negation of entropy.
It is a heightened resistance to entropy.
And I think, you know, one of the ways that I frame my worldview is, you know,
through this lens of evolution and the lens of, you know, cosmic evolution, biological evolution,
you know, seeing how, you know, we did come from a much more primordial state.
And one of the ways, one of the models that I like a lot is Conway's Game of Life,
because I don't know if it's been discussed in this room,
because I feel like every time the question of are we in a simulation gets brought up,
everybody always brings up Conway's Game of Life, and I think it's for a reason.
Because Conway's Game of Life shows that, you know,
very simple systems with very simple rules create, like, these complex environments,
you know, that evolve on their own.
And in a way, you know, our universe, you know, started from a primordial set of rules,
and then from that primordial set of rules, you know, stars evolved, planets evolved,
life evolved, humans evolved, and here we are.
So, you know, I think that this idea, this idea that our universe is entailed
through some sort of simulation process, at its surface, you know, I consider it to be plausible,
but then my question goes, you know, say somebody used the example,
in like 10, 20 years, who knows, we might have like a Grand Theft Auto 20,
where the mechanics are indistinguishable from our own universe.
This makes me think the question is, can those characters in that game,
are they ever going to have any ability to have any consequentiality on the external world?
So, another way of putting it, and let's say Conway's Game of Life,
if it gets very complex enough, if you tweak some things in the game,
and you make it so it can model, it can eventually evolve into, you know, a universe like this one,
are those agents, are those entities in that game ever going to be able to modify
the limbs of the transistors that are creating the simulation?
And to apply that to us, if we are in a simulation, given that it's plausible,
are we ever going to have the ability to look at the transistors,
to look at whatever is entailing this simulation?
Are we ever going to be able to go beyond our ground of existence
into the universe beneath us, or above us, that is simulating us?
I think so. My take is that our universe is self-contained.
And if we are a simulation, you know, we are an internally self-contained system.
And I think that in terms of whether there's going to be any discovery of what's outside,
I don't think that there is anything there for us to work with.
I think if there is a simulation, we are self-contained.
And I think that we better just understand the mechanics of our universe,
you know, through our inquiries, through our physics, through our quantum mechanics.
And I think, you know, that's, and through our morals, our ethics, you know,
I think that the question of whether we are a simulation, you know,
it's a fascinating intellectual inquiry, but ultimately, you know,
the more prescient question is, how do we deal with our own existence
like in this realm in our self-contained universe?
And that's my spiel. Thanks for listening.
I heard somebody trying to make comments.
That was me. I wanted to respond to you, Ramdy.
So, okay, okay, so we think about what Ramdy just said in terms of,
but also think about all the compute that would be required to simulate all the physics
that Ramdy spoke about, like all the compute required to,
for the DNA not just of every single life form and, you know,
to simulate the evolution and the mutation and the physics of all of that.
So a software simulation of reality in a computer, a reality like Grand Theft Auto,
is about rendering graphics that have artificial physics,
but that's not like real physics.
And so, like, when we're talking about simulating string theory,
or on eigenstate thermalization based on random local,
based on local random matrix theory,
or computer simulations of extremely basic particle physics,
like extremely basic particle collisions.
For example, computers at astrophysics labs, you know, working on things like LHC,
they're using the world's biggest supercomputers for these basic physics simulations.
So what I'm saying is, like, there may not be enough compute on Earth
to simulate even one human brain before 2050,
and maybe not even before 2060.
And even then, I don't think we're really talking about simulating the particle physics
of every neural oscillation in a single brain.
So the idea of a computer that could accurately simulate the entire cosmos is itself
just because of the amount of compute involved just by itself is just a far-fetched idea.
But this computer with its vast resources would also have to likely exist in a universe
that may also be simulated.
So if one simulation contains many smaller simulations,
and those smaller simulations contain many more smaller simulations,
and each subsequent simulation should be draining the compute resources
of the first simulation or the highest simulation.
So as you explore this idea, you begin to see that each new simulation within a simulation
increases the amount of compute required by profound amounts.
And each new sim is decreasingly likely, is basically decreasing,
it's a decreasingly likely situation.
And the most likely situation is that the number of simulations is like one or zero,
because there's like the amount of compute complexity just increases with each new one.
And so that was my point.
I agree with you, Micah.
I agree with your premise.
And, you know, well, one time I brought this up and I posed the question,
okay, so if we're a simulation and the universe is simulating us to being simulated,
and that universe is being simulated, you know, is it turtles all the way down?
And I think you make a great point that, you know, every subsequent simulation,
you know, there's going to be some diminishment of the capacity to, you know, simulate things.
And, you know, perhaps if given, granted that let's say we are a simulation,
you know, it seems like it seems possible that, you know, the one, the universe,
or whatever you want to call that realm simulating us might be like the ground one.
But I think, you know, if we're going to think that way, you know, like,
I think it's very hard for us to, like, cognize, you know, what kind of realm it could be that, you know,
has the potential to simulate a universe like this.
You know, it could be a realm that is, like, beyond anything that we can even conceive.
And perhaps, you know, perhaps this universe could be a simulation without having a simulator,
you know, without having some sort of agency responsible for the simulation.
Perhaps that's just how universes work.
That's just how universes, they function through an arbitrary set of physics constants.
You know, like, perhaps they're, like, speaking to, like, the multi, multi, the many worlds hypothesis.
You know, there could be many universes with slightly tweaked, you know, fundamental constants.
And this universe just happens to have the constants that are, like, finally tuned to create this instantiation of life.
And there could be other universes that, after their big bangs, they just fizzle out and nothing happens.
And other universes where, you know, stars and planets don't form.
And you know what I'm saying?
Like, there could be an infinite repertoire of possible outcomes.
And that could just be, like, some fundamental nature of potentiality that has nothing to do with some agency programming,
a special stimulation, you know, with that type of intelligence.
So I think there's, there's, we have to kind of, like, probe at our assumptions, you know, and our things that we apply to agencies and models.
Go ahead.
Yeah, well, we're in a loop right now.
We've actually been here, like, two hours ago. We did this loop.
And I don't think Mike or you were here.
I just want to try to get us out of the loop.
And Yosha ended up talking about a beautiful metaphor, how we're a vorticee in a plane of water.
And I wanted to ask him a question on that.
So maybe we can jump out of the loop and fast forward to where we were when he was answering.
Okay.
And it was, so here's my question because I've had, Yosha, you're the first person I've ever met with who thinks as perhaps a human brain is a vorticee.
And first off, that's a monopole.
So what's your opinion on the monopole-dive-hole thing, if that's how you think about things?
And second, I'd really would love to hear your opinion on why the golden ratio or the Fibonacci sequence seems to exude itself pretty pervasively throughout our simulation of the air quotes.
Thank you.
This is Robert Carbone and I'm complete.
I said you are complete, maybe the only complete person or who knows. I cannot answer your questions really. So in a way you can think about patterns that are stable and patterns that are not stable.
The patterns that are stable are essentially those that are in a way periodic that keep the information constant flow or the information content in a certain volume constant.
If you are radiating information out of a volume, you are using that information inside of the volume, right?
So that means that you have to look for patterns, if you want to have a stable pattern, that bend back into themselves so they can be stable.
And if you look at continuous substrates and water is something that is approximately continuous and it's made from too many parts to count.
The things that are stable and water are vortices, which means you have something that rotates around in itself.
So it stays stable in a given volume.
It's a monopole because it's two dimensional and the vortex itself remains stable needs dynamics that extend a little bit above two dimensions.
So you need to turn this into this corn.
It only works if you can bend the surface of the water. If the surface of the water would be completely flat, don't know if you could have a stable vortex.
And you need to have basically changes in density.
If you can change the density of the surface, then again you can have vortices.
The Fibonacci's viral is a pattern that extends outwards. It doesn't bend back into itself.
And it bends back at the outwards in a relatively simple and stable ratio.
And I suspect that these outward bending processes, there are a number of them and a number of ratios around them.
And the Fibonacci's viral is just one of the common patterns that you can get when you have a process that originates at some kind of point, some kind of angular momentum, in addition to the outward flowing momentum.
If you want to have something that bends back into itself, you're cutting out.
In a stable process, can you hear me?
In a stable process, basically the information needs to travel in a periodic way.
So if you imagine you take some kind of spiral and you try to bend it in such a way that the information traveling along that spiral doesn't get lost, at some point you get a circle.
And this is the equivalent of the vortex.
And the vortices that the particles are made of are not in 2D, but they are in multiple dimensions that are not necessarily aligned with the dimensions of the space in which the photonic interactions take place.
So when somebody like Tesla says everything is light, I think what he refers to is that the space that you are in is the space where we have locations with the potential for interactions with photons.
And all the interesting interactions that you observe outside of the core of atoms are interactions via photons.
So with some approximation, everything is photons.
So everything is light.
That, in the sense, this is correct, but it's because light can interact across certain types of vortices that can form the components of atoms and molecules.
So Isla Prigagin came up with, I think, could it be the original idea that human beings are dissipative systems or vortices?
And so you can see that basically the entire universe is a fractal vortexes or vortices from a galaxy to an atom to a cell to the human brain to basically everything is a vortex in some sense, or a dissipative system.
And that has to maintain its own equilibrium and export increasing amounts of chaos to the surrounding environment in order to maintain its equilibrium in that sense.
I would say that if you look up just vortices in brain waves or vortices in the brain or imagine them, if you just Google the brain as a vortex, you can see there's a lot that's been written about this over the years.
In the context of the thought experiment that I presented, I just tried to give something like a visual metaphor that allows us to imagine that an observer is a multi-stable particle system.
So it's basically lots of small vortices that form larger vortices.
And an individual particle, I imagine, to be something like a mathematical vortex that is oscillating in multiple dimensions.
Depending on the type of the particle, it can be two, four, or eight dimensions of combination thereof.
And they basically get embedded into a larger surrounding interaction space which oscillates in fewer dimensions and you can get the things at scale into a curved three-dimensional space that is evolving in time.
And so the thinking of yourself is a system of vortices that are multi-stable that can arrange themselves in such a way that they don't fall apart, but they can form memories that, so remember things in their past and can use this to control their behavior in the future.
I saw that as a helpful way to think about our own nature.
But it doesn't mean that we are literally going around in spirals or circles or waterfalls.
I think Alan Watts has a really great illustration where he kind of takes this topic of how we are just like little eddies in this giant ocean.
And within the eddies are little smaller eddies and I think this topic does have a basis in a broader intuition.
And so Alan Watts, he kind of expands the metaphor even more and applies it to what we call nouns as things.
He says that all nouns are actually verbs.
So I am the universe human. That is not a tree. That is the universe treeing. Every noun is a verb because everything that exists in this timeline, in this universe, like a tree or a human, is a process.
It is a process that is constantly undergoing metabolism, respiration, all these processes that are sustained through cellular mechanisms and eventually it expires.
And if you can kind of look at time as a dimensional aspect where you can kind of imagine a timeline from beginning to end where it starts at zero and then as it moves through time, you can kind of capture slices of the frames.
And then you put them all together and it creates this long undulating snake. You will see that everything from its onset, from the moment you were conceived until the moment you were died, you can kind of picture this with time as an added dimension.
You go out to the higher dimensions from that. You kind of imagine the timeline of your life as this long undulating snake and then throughout that time there is everything like air, oxygen, food, water is pouring into you and then you are releasing air, water, excrement.
And there is a constant cycle where things are coming into you and coming out to you and there is never a moment where there is a concrete, static thing.
And I think it is a very fascinating thought experiment to imagine everything in the universe as this process, as this happening where you take that time dimension and you imagine things as undulating snakes.
You see that everything is like, we are all our little, our little, our little eddies in the ocean and then we are all kind of like it transmitting like matter and energy to each other and we are all kind of like in this embedded sea of like the eddies among eddies and eddies and those eddies.
And I think it is a very beautiful thought experiment to kind of visualize what the Buddhists call the principle of Puraktityasamutpada which is the interdependent origins of all things.
And I owe all this to Alan Wanz for spelling it out for me.
Ramsey, I am a huge fan of Alan Wanz. Thank you so much for that eloquently.
Can I ask a quick question if no one else has a question?
Please do.
Thanks, I have been waiting.
Yeah, my question is, so obviously the idea of real living in a simulation is something that we want to talk about and consider.
So we obviously need to switch from classical computational power to quantum computational power because of the limited computational power and notion of time, obviously.
So my question is, so quantum systems, we know that they can exist in superposition of states.
And well, this superposition is basically described by this wave function and the observation that causes this wave function to collapse to one of these many possible states.
And so my question is if the idea, well, basically if it's just a pure, if you can look at it as a pure simulation which has no collapse, or there is, because if you want to bring in laws of quantum physics into the simulation,
everything is going to be, like, a little bit spooky and messy, like, we can think of it as everything that is decided when you look at it and the rest of the simulation.
Obviously there's no way that you're going to see that you're living in a neutral reality because if you come here with whatever you want, you can get real.
And you want to observe it and laugh at it in that state. So I would like to know what people think about this simulation as a pure state simulation or as kind of, like, if you want to bring in the laws of quantum physics into it.
Because obviously, like, if you want to, like, take into account the time and artificial power, you can have a simulation, like, it's already a no.
Because think about it, like, if you want to, like, simulate one nucleus, it's going to take, like, a pretty classical physics physics that we know, it's going to take 10 years, 20, 30 years.
It's going to take all the human in years and just talking about the visible universe. And now we have all this dark energy, dark matter.
So I would like to know what people think about bringing in laws of quantum physics into it.
If we're living in a neutral simulation, it at least has to come down to quantum mechanics and probably the software that's going to simulate it.
I don't think so.
Yeah, yeah, but, like, how does the idea of collapse work in this simulation?
If it's a pure state or...
I don't think it's real.
I've been... yeah, collapse is... I mean, I was described more like a quantum reference picture.
So if you isolate a quantum system that has certain stable counterstates, which can be basically the rest of the environment is what's causing the collapse of these counterstates.
But that's just because you're tracing out the rest of the degrees of freedom in the rest of the world.
Sorry, could you go into what you mean by collapse? Are you talking about, like, black holes?
I think you're talking about wave-functioning collapse, right?
Yes, I'm talking about wave-functioning collapse.
Basically it means you have one description of the universe as a wave-function that changes suddenly into the universe as discrete events in states.
Exactly, exactly. It's a function that propagates through time and space, and by observation it collapses into states.
So we have this app, our universe as a quantum system that can exist in a superposition of states, and this superposition is described by this wave-function of the universe of space-time,
and the act of observation causes this wave-function to collapse into one of these many possible states, or superposition of possible states that we have.
So in some sense the present is discrete. Whatever you actualize is, in some sense, definite.
And the projections that you make into the future in the past are less definite, but they are described as a mismatch between the states of the substrate and the classical states that we use in the classical description.
And the classical description is a very efficient one.
It allows us to make very efficient control models of the universe that you're in,
but it's basically fitting a curve to observations that are on the substrate level, and the substrates cannot be described by the classical states, right?
So in some sense there is a mismatch between two levels of description, and that mismatch is a superposition, right?
So the underlying states do not correspond one-to-one to the supervenient emergent classical states.
And this is deco-continuing information.
Is it the collapse of the wave-function?
The deco-continuation, when the wave loses its infinite potentiality, when an observer's known information reaches a certain threshold.
Basically, when an observer reduces its information, the collapse occurs, deco-continuation occurs.
JW, when you say infinite potentiality, it sounds very romantic.
Do you have an emotion when you say that, or is this a technical term for you?
Just the potential for basically any outcome to occur in some form, in some probability.
Like, is it literally infinite?
No, because, you know, we know that there is an finite amount of energy in the universe from the first law.
Okay, so we have a finite set of possible outcomes, not infinite.
Let's take a check. I mean it in the metaphorical term, the mathematical sense.
No, there is no difference.
That's literal.
Yes, but we're using something that is not literal. I think that you were carried away by a romantic emotion.
What is the long description of reality, I think?
Yeah, I would say they collapse, and observers don't.
There's not observers, and again, in my perspective, more from an agritarian picture,
but collapse isn't an effective description from tracing it.
Similarly to the rest of the world.
Similarly to a player uploading their consciousness through a data exchange with a remote control
into a grand theft auto avatar character, choosing to make a left-hand turn down the street.
Now, once the known information reaches a certain threshold, the scene can now be rendered.
The potential of states collapses into a finite state.
Hey, I was just referring to the stance that you were taking to your observation.
It didn't seem to be an unmoved observer, but it seemed to be...
You felt a certain enthusiasm that I think does not belong into physics.
The God of Truth is some very cold machine.
If it warms you, you're not serving it right.
I'd like to make a question.
Every time I try to solve a problem, I imagine if there's a simple problem I can solve,
and the problem as it's posed right now is just beyond my ability to even comprehend.
So I was wondering if in the literature, anybody has ever looked into a simpler dimension
or just getting rid of problems altogether and just looking at classical world,
where people were able to ask a meaningful investigation into whether they could figure out whether it was a simulation at all.
I just kind of want to reiterate my point that if we are in a simulation,
I think no matter what, we're self-contained.
Similar to how the video game players... it's a crummy analogy, crummy metaphor,
but similar to how the video game characters are going to be able to see you playing them
or see the transistors representing them.
There's an engine producing them, simulating them, and they're kind of like locked in their own self-contained system.
So perhaps somebody may have an alternate explanation that may rebut this,
but I think at least my intuition has it very clear that if we are in a simulation, we're self-contained,
and all we can do is look at our own universe, and I don't think there is quite a way to access whatever is the ground beneath us.
So yeah, I don't... Ramsey, I have a question. So like, did you see the monkey on the phone by chance of the Neuralink?
Yeah.
I just... I mean, the way I look at it is we create an AGI, we create a video game that is interactive with us.
There is no differentiation.
There is no differentiation. Sorry, it's getting like here on the East Coast.
And I do think that that will be possible very soon, and I think that's why I'm holding this room.
I mean, it's a fantastic discussion, but people from different departments and different avenues,
we all need to come together to have these discussions because everybody's in their own little world
and doing what they do. And if you're not aware of a different perspective, I think that it just doesn't lead to evolution.
So Ramsey, I have an experimental rebuttal to your point.
In physics, it turns out that you can actually look at the world in a different scale.
So if you look at it with a human scale, you see the classical physics.
And then you can ask the question, is there a beautiful question that I can pose on this world to see if there's something else going on behind the curtain?
And there is a theory called Comagor for Arnold and Mozart here.
That says that mathematically, the classical mechanics is self-contained, which is your point, that it is logically self-contained.
And those of you who may know the classical mechanics, it's trying to perturb a classical system, possibly from thermal source or possibly from quantum fluctuation.
But it turns out that as long as the perturbation is small, then the chloride, the multidimensional chloride of the tree after this preserve,
it'll break and break out into a chaotic motion.
But then, like yet, we have found, we have been behind that.
And so our ability to experiment, to perform a direct experiment with nature, has given us access to stuff that's underneath it.
And so if you're asking the question of, can we have the mathematical system that self-contained, yes, in the existence of classical mechanics,
but for one of these and many of the miracles in the world that we are able to do,
perform experiments that are beyond the end feeling the construct.
And so there lies the hope of discovering something that's beyond the end feeling the construct.
Two things, Karol, can you, number one, can you just repeat the name of the theorem that you just mentioned?
Kolmogrov, Arnold, Mozart, you know, Chromagras?
No, no, no, Kolmogrov, K-O-N-O-N-O-L-V.
Korov, O-G-O-R-O-V.
Kolmogrov, Python, Arnold, A-R-N-O-L-V.
Python, Mozart, M-O-S-C-R.
You can just, you can search camp theory, K-A-F theory, probably.
Okay, thanks for that. So, okay, so that was one.
So the second thing was, so you're implying that there are experiments that might give you some information input from something that might be underlying.
But I guess maybe I didn't phrase my initial statement correctly.
So we might be able to receive input in whatever is behind the curtain.
I don't think that it's a compelling mechanism to entail that there might be a way for us to affect an output onto that other than whatever innate output that the hot-decorate has to observe the simulation.
You know what I'm saying? I don't think there's...
No, I don't... That's why I asked the question, are there any reduced problems that are...
They ask this sort of question in a simpler system so that we can sort of get an inkling of what the...
If it sheds any light into the possibility or the impossibility.
And again, I've found that we can have the smartest people think about what the world should be, but the nature has always trumped us.
And coming from a phenomenological background, I am just wondering, okay, now where do we look for the answers?
And maybe in the shape of a simple problem or maybe in the shape of some discovery by somebody?
But just talking about it like this, I don't know how much you're dealing with this.
But I think this, again, might be the problem where we actually define simulation again because there could be...
You can define simulation in a way that could possibly be distinguishable from...
Whether it's a simulation or not, I think you can define the way that this can be distinguishable.
I would like to just throw in a thought experiment.
So maybe if you're thinking about designing a computer, the only thing that the character in the computer can notice is the environment that was created by the computer.
It can be really difficult to imagine what's outside and that's creating that before the character of the computer.
I mean, you can even look at what is it, Godel's incompleteness theorem or in terms of trying to argue that there are just things that are outside the sphere that you're in.
There are just some things that will never be knowable, right?
So what I'm thinking is like, but if you can model the solar system and people model the solar system, they simulate it.
You can test ideas about how the solar system works without being able to observe everything that you would need to prove that those ideas are.
So basically the simulation of the solar system helps to prove or helps to demonstrate that the ideas of how the solar system works are actually correct.
And so what I'm saying is like, if you're within the simulation and you have enough computer that you could simulate the simulation from inside the simulation, then you could create testable predictions that you could say,
well, if it's like a transistor-based computer that is creating this simulation, then something weird should happen at this point.
I don't know what that testable prediction would be, but if you can get really precise about simulating your own simulation, then you could try to make inferences about what would be required to simulate that simulation
and then what you could look for from within that simulation that might indicate which type of simulation you're in if you're in a simulation.
I think a good way is to find out what kind of simulation you like to simulate.
So just to clarify, are you basically asking what's the almost lossless compression of the higher order simulation?
Or if there's loss, how can we, if we're inside one of these simulations, how can we distinguish from at least the higher order simulation?
That could be just one possible example of something that we might want to look for that could provide a clue to what's outside the simulation.
I think it'd be interesting to think about at what point, well, if you look at virtual realities we have today, like the Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto, if we look at the code that the program is creating of that virtual reality, we should be able to distinguish the code between the NPCs, the non-player characters, and the actual characters.
There's a post-singularity, you know, when artificial intelligence vastly exceeds human intelligence and is creating technology for us.
At what point will we be able to distinguish potentially between NPCs and actual players in the simulation, those that actually have free will versus those that are determined to create storylines for others in the simulation?
I have an interesting thought experiment with this. In the old days when there was no accurate watches, people were trying to build ever so accurate watches.
So you can imagine, time is the real thing, and the time that you read off from your watch, like this back several hundred years ago, is the simulated time reading.
So the meaningful thought experiment is, how would you know if one watch was more accurate than the other?
I think you could compare it to a sundial.
So the topic that was just in the room was, behind the curtain, so I'm thinking of the mystery of dark energy.
Because dark energy is the energy of empty space, you know, just in the quantum vacuum that is like making the universe expand at a faster rate.
So has anybody ever pondered that perhaps dark energy is energy that is being input into this universe from the ground of existence, from beyond the curtain?
Has that ever crossed anybody's mind?
I think I asked Yosha this earlier. He had a really beautiful explanation of what dark energy is. Go ahead, Yosha.
It was dark matter, not dark energy.
That's right. Go ahead.
It's part of the same physical universe in which we are. The standard model proposes that we have four forces.
We have the strong force, which binds the parts of the atomic nucleus together, and the weak force, which allows them to decay again, not fall into each other completely.
And then we have the electromagnetic forces, which keeps the electrons in the vicinity of the core and allows the atoms to form by the electrons molecules.
And that allows electrons to bounce against each other and thereby facilitate the interaction between the molecules.
And then we have gravity, which is the weakest force of all.
And gravity describes the curvature of the space in which the photonic interactions take place.
And there, imagine now that there is something that interacts with gravity, but for some reason it's not electromagnetic at all. So it does not interact with electrons, with photons at all.
And this is the non-baryonic matter.
20% of the universe is the baryonic matter, and this is the stuff that somehow interacts with photons.
And this is us, right? We are interacting with photons. Everything that we touch, we interact with it with some kind of electromagnetic push against our fingers, against our cochleas, or electromagnetic base hitting our readiness.
And so we cannot sense any kind of matter that is not interacting by photons, except by measuring the gravitational effects that it has.
And they are very subtle, because gravity is so weak, it's very difficult to make a measurement for changes in gravity, or subtle differences in gravity.
And by observing the movement of the stars and put the particles out in space, we notice that there must be additional mass in the universe to explain the curvature that you're observing.
And we know that it's probably not just some mistake in which we calculate gravity at scale, because there have been supernova that affected the visible matter and blew away some solar systems and so on.
But the gravity that has been exerted in this region is not affected, which means that there is mass in this region that is not aligned with the supernova that took place.
So the supernova basically blasted away the baryonic matter and observed the photons, but some of the other stuff is still there.
We cannot see it, but we see that it exerts gravity. And so by and large, the dark matter seems to be somewhat aligned with what they are doing, but not completely.
And because 80% is dark matter and it doesn't collapse, it's probably dark forces between the dark matter, so the additional interactions that exist in the part of the universe that is not interacting with the photonic stuff,
but it is hidden literally dark because it's not interacting with photons. And I find it interesting to speculate about the dark matter people and their 12 dark forces, and how long it takes them to discover us that there is 20% of matter in the universe
and the universe is not interacting with any of the other dark forces, but only with the weakest force in their universe, because the only 20% of their universe takes them longer to discover us than us to discover them.
But this is not necessarily related to what goes on behind the curtain, right? This is also in front of the curtain.
You just described dark matter and not dark energy, which in my understanding is the energy of empty space that is making the universe expand at a much faster rate because one would expect that after the Big Bang there would be a dissipation and the expansion would slow down,
but we're actually with the opposite, the expansion is speeding up. So my question was, is there a likelihood or anything that we can entertain about this energy that is making the universe expand at a faster rate, perhaps that might be being cycling from behind the curtain?
No, not at all. The thing behind the curtain would be something that shows that the thing that happens in front of the curtain is somehow magic that there's a conspiracy going on.
The idea of the simulation is that the universe is not what it seems, not in the sense that there is stuff that we just cannot observe, because it's at the level that we have difficulty observing or measuring from where we are as embedded observers,
but because the universe only pretends to be what it is. And behind this pretence, there is a causal structure that exists to produce precisely what we are observing.
Imagine that the intuition that we sometimes might have, that this world that we are in is something like a computer game, that we are amateurs in a computer game,
and that we forget that we exist actually outside of this computer game because all our senses are completely immersed in it, so we don't form memories of our interactions outside the computer game,
or maybe the parts of us that are immersed in the game don't remember, but there is maybe a game master, and there is maybe some communication going on behind the players, behind the curtain,
over the board of the role-playing game in which to participate takes place. If you take that intuition to be the reality, then this universe that we are in is basically just the gaming board on which everything plays out,
and maybe our two selves outside in the parent universe have set up this gaming board, so we can engage in this game with each other.
Thank you. That was very beautiful. I just want to say hi to Cecilia, Shahriar and Mohamed. Shahriar and Mohamed, like you have some work in quantum mechanics, modeling, and mathematics respectively, so it would be interesting to get your take on our reliving assimilation.
Hi everyone, thanks very much for having me here. I just recently joined, I'm enjoying the conversation here, so I'm gonna be around and enjoying, and I will basically try again if I have anything to add. Thank you everyone.
Hi, I actually had a question. Is it alright if I ask that?
Go ahead, David. Thank you. First of all, thanks for letting me come up on stage. I had two questions for Joshua, one rooted in mathematics and another about the theory of simulation you presented.
I've been listening for about three hours, and particularly just a little before you brought up how certain rotations can be represented in 2D and 4D space, but can't be represented in 3D space. I was curious about this, particularly on two points.
One, you mentioned there are two types of rotations, one rooted on the dimensional plane, and another that considers time. I might be butchering that. Could you go more into why that rotation that considers time would exist?
But I'm actually more interested on the point you made that it's possible in certain dimensions, 2D and 4D and not in 3D dimensional space. Is that due to some mathematical difficulty?
Okay, I'll try to explain. Is this light misunderstanding? Maybe it's difficult to get it across in such a short amount of time.
So let me try to explain complex numbers for you. For everybody who just know them, they're very simple to understand.
Complex numbers are a way to write down two-dimensional numbers. One-dimensional number is a real number or an integer number. As you all know, they can arrange them on a single scale on some kind of ray that goes in an unbounded direction towards infinity.
This allows you to organize things in one dimension. If you want to organize things in two dimensions, you need to use a coordinate pair, an x and a y. An elegant way to express the x and a y as a single term is to write them as a sum.
If you write them as a sum of two real numbers, the problem is that you can just sum them up and they are a single number again.
So we make sure that they don't become one number to give one a unit. And this unit should not be collapsing into the other, right?
So in the same sense as you can have apples and oranges that are now two dimensions, if you add these two dimensions together, they're not going to mix.
The number that mathematicians have discovered that is very useful as a unit is i. i is the number that is defined as being the square root of minus one.
And so it's somewhat like one or minus one, only it's not because the square root of minus one is not defined as a real number.
But so the nice thing is when you multiply this number with yourselves, it's imaginary number i. Get one, right? Because the square root of the square root, if you multiply it with itself, it disappears because it gets squared.
The square root is the inverse of the square, right? So the square root of minus one, multiply it with itself, gives one minus one.
And now you can perform multiplications with this i. So the x-coordinate, you choose your normal real numbers for the y-coordinate, you take real numbers, multiply it with i.
Right? So on the x-axis, you have one, two, three, four, five, and so on. On the y-axis, you have one i, two i, three i, four i, i is the square root of minus one.
And you can also do this for the negative numbers, minus one, multiply it with i, minus two, multiply it with i, and so on, on the y-axis.
And minus one, minus two, and three, because you're all in your coordinate system.
So now you can do addition in the normal way, which means you can add, for instance, 12 plus 13 i, and you add one plus two i.
And you get coordinate pair, right? You can do normal vector addition in this way.
You can also do scaling. You can just multiply your 12 plus two i, this is two, and so you have 24 plus four i, and you just have a normal vector multiplication.
And now a very funny thing happens is you can then multiply this i, or the multiple of i, or fraction of i, because what you would now do is that you rotate.
I mentioned that you look at one, you multiply it with i, you get i. If you multiply i with i again, you get minus one.
If you multiply minus one again with i, you get minus i, and if you multiply minus i with i, you get one, right?
So each time you multiply it with i, you move 90 degrees. You rotate 90 degrees.
You can get the intermediate rotations by multiplying with a fraction, but the fraction will not be on the circle.
So the resulting thing needs to be scaled by multiplying the first, the real part, the complex number, so you can make arbitrary rotations by just having such a complex number.
This means that using complex numbers, you can write down two-dimensional numbers in such a way that you can perform rotation as a multiplication.
In the space of complex numbers, rotations become multiplications, very elegant.
And the same thing works in four-dimensions. In four-dimensions, you can find an i and a j and a k that have the same property,
that as the i and the complex numbers, you can multiply them in such a way that they cancel each other out and allow you to do elegant rotations.
But this is not possible in three-dimensions. In three-dimensions, there is no i and j that would cancel each other out in such a way.
So it turns out you cannot define any kind of rotations in a three-dimensional space that are not two-dimensional.
Of course, you can perform two-dimensional rotations in 3D. You can always make something in a higher-dimensional space happen.
You can take a piece of paper, not rotated just on a table and 2D, but you can take it into 3D and rotate it in 3D.
But every time that you rotate your piece of paper, imagine it's flat, in 3D, you're only going to perform 2D rotation around an axis.
And there's only going to be a single axis. You can align this axis any way that you want in space.
But you will always rotate around the plane that is perpendicular to this axis.
So in 3D, you can only make two-dimensional rotations. In 2D, you can make two-dimensional rotations.
In 1D, you cannot make any rotations. In 4D, you can make new rotations.
There are just no pads of rotations that are possible in 4D. And there are no new rotations in 5D.
So you can make, of course, two-dimensional and four-dimensional rotations in 5D.
In 6D, there are no new ones. In 7D, there are new ones. But in 8D, again, there are a bunch of new ones.
And this is it. There are no more in 6D dimensions.
So the complex numbers in 4D dimensions are delta sum with other quaternions.
And then we have the octonions and these are the eight-dimensional numbers.
And so these are the mathematical reasons, but you can have rotations only in 2D and 4D and then in 8D,
because you cannot define complex numbers in this way.
You can also try to present all this and look at the big patterns that go into the rotations
and in the convergence of these big patterns.
And I think this would be the constructive proof that you would need to make to show that you can only build rotations in this way.
Thanks. And that makes sense. Thank you for explaining that.
And did you say that there are no more than 16 dimensions?
There are more than 16 dimensions, but in 16 dimensions, you cannot have new rotations.
All the rotations will still be up to eight-dimensional rotations.
Oh, okay. Thank you.
There's a lot. Thanks for that.
So another thing is, if you look at the definition of the eye and the one,
you could flip the sign of the eye and still have rotations.
If you do this, you get a different rotation.
It's not one that is euclidean, where the thing that you rotate retains its shape,
but things get squashed when you rotate them.
And this also is possible for 4D, so 4D you can also invert the sign.
And then you describe relativistic physics. You use a 4-dimensional space.
It's 3 spatial dimension and 1 time dimension.
And the time dimension is different from the space dimension.
And you probably have noticed this, right?
There is a fundamental difference between the dimension of time and the dimension of space.
That is, you can rotate an object in space and it retains its shape.
But for some reason, you cannot rotate it into time.
And relativistic physics tells you, yes, you can rotate it in time,
but it's very hard to do so, and it will change its shape if you do this.
So you will have a dilation between space and time, if that happens.
And this is because it's a hyperbolic rotation.
It's one where the time axis has a different sign than the spatial axis.
There are a number of beautiful YouTube videos that try to illustrate this point,
but I found that I did not really understand the underlying mathematics
before a friend of mine gave me a book.
I probably have forgotten the title.
It's written by some physicist who discovered this relationship to number 0.
It's very beautiful.
Yeah, that sounds very interesting.
I'll definitely try to understand it more myself,
but thank you for giving me a precursor to that.
My second question on your theory of simulation.
I tried to read Schopenhauer's Will as representation.
I tried to digest his philosophy.
You may have a better perspective on his philosophy,
but from my perspective, he describes the Will as something unconscious and aimless.
In your theory of simulation, where would Will exist?
Particularly in your view, would that also be a part of the simulated universe
and that we're just not actually a part of a unique object
that could exist outside of the simulation?
Or would it be something that's kind of like concerted into the simulation?
I think that Will only exists in a mind.
And Will is a certain perspective that the representation of the mind of itself
will have of its own action tendencies.
There are two ways to make a measurement in the world.
One is the absolute measurement.
You take an absolute scale of something, right?
It is a certain value.
And the other one is you take a difference to how it should be.
So you perceive a tension.
And this tension is motivating your own action.
You have to make some kind of commitment to how things should be.
Because you are not meant to choose what you regulate in the world.
Yourself is not making these commitments.
These commitments are going to be upstream from yourself.
It's the features of your mind that produce the self rather than at the level that the self can control.
So you might perceive, for instance, that the world wants to be more just.
There is a tension in the world between how the world is and how the world should be.
The world should obviously be just, right?
And so it's your job to make it more just.
But it's very obvious, right?
Because you perceive this big tension.
But of course, justice and injustice are not features of physics.
There are features that you project into the world.
Because at some level, your mind has made a commitment to how the world should be.
And it's only when you deconstruct this commitment and replace it by a deeper commitment,
you realize that justice becomes instrumental.
Right?
Suddenly you stop perceiving justice and injustice in the world.
Then no longer exists.
But now exists, for instance, the conformance to agreed laws.
Or what exists is the awareness of the consequences of your actions and acts being based on this.
Or there can be symmetries in behavior and so on.
You suddenly have all these notions.
And some of them are useful.
And some of them are purpose.
And others are not.
And you're no longer committed to certain substances because you have stopped to perceive it as a
private commitment that exists in your subjective universe, right?
For you to achieve that step, you deconstruct your perception of justice and injustice.
You cannot imagine that you couldn't be looking at the universe without justice and injustice.
And after you've done this, it is very difficult to go back to this earlier stage.
It makes yourself perceive it directly in the sense that you perceive it as a primal force in the universe
and you see all the force fields.
So when you describe will as an underlying factor in the universe, you are perceiving that
experientially there's always something that cares in the universe.
Because the way that your own mental simulation is being constructed depends on your mind caring about something.
And you can deconstruct these cares, which happens when you go on a trajectory to enlightenment, right?
So the easiest stage that you can get to is that you're no longer moved directly by actual impulses.
That you perceive all the impulses that you have as emanations of your own mind.
And you have a distance to them.
You're no longer directly moved to them by them.
And you can decide whether you act on them or not based on the consequences that you perceive.
And when you go on a deeper level, you can turn them all off and make them instrumental to an underlying thing.
Maybe the underlying thing is love.
And so you recognize love as the primal force for everything in the universe.
And by serving love in the right way, you will have to do all the other things like eating and so on.
It's necessary to maintain your organism, so you can serve love in the right way.
And the same way justice, for instance, is also instrumental only to love.
It does not exist independently of it.
And you can get one step further and there's nothing left but aesthetics.
So you're only interested in finding patterns that make sense.
And in that stage, you are a big busy human being.
There is nothing that is good or bad in the world.
There's just a very degree of complexity and predictive power.
And if you let go of finding patterns in the world, then everything falls apart.
Because you stop paying attention.
You stop opposing order on the world.
And what happens if I go through this stage of meditation?
The world becomes completely tazzy and gray.
It disappears and I fall asleep.
I basically become unconscious.
Until I wake up again in a reported state.
We're right here again.
I agree with that.
That makes a lot of sense.
But what about not will as a commitment or a feeling about the world,
but your experience of your own will versus a particular will to do something in particular?
My own will is just a commitment that my nervous system makes at some level
to raise a motive to an intention.
And that I perceive this right and this equality to this representation or to this underlying dynamic of this model is the perception of my own will.
Yes, so like that perception of your will, would you say that is the same thing as your will
or that would be something separate from your will?
There is no my will apart from the representation because I only exist as a representation.
I am only virtual.
If I deconstruct the I, my will disappears.
There are no longer formulate sentences that I want without life.
That's the age, right?
It's a real state.
In that state, I might still feel an urge for movements,
but this urge is no longer associated with myself.
So I could say that there is something that the universe wants in the perception that exists in a sense.
Maybe there is thirst in the universe and something to drink must be found,
but you will no longer perceive in that state that it's very much bound to your own person
and it might no longer motivate you to do something because it just exists,
but it doesn't have a relationship to you.
I would like to say that I had a deep experience one time where I
conceptually reduced the concept of I at the very minimum to being like a directional concept
and so long as you have a directional concept to represent self
then you could in the organism that is you could sort of navigate life and say,
well, this direction needs food or something.
The most primitive possible sense of ego is just the directional concept.
I'm sorry, not the most primitive possible effective.
I think it needs to be connected to the perception of your own agency.
I mentioned that there is pain and an integral part of pain,
I think, is the urge to move away from it.
You might be able to control it, but you will need to implement some kind of counterpoint
to the urge to move away from the pain, right?
And under diagnosis you can, for instance, if you are,
don't respond to anesthetics, if you need to have some tooth surgery and so on,
maybe you'll find a diagnosis, puts you on a stage where you no longer react to that pain.
And what happens is that the pain is still available, but it's still information.
And it is a directional information because you can notice that the pain becomes larger
or smaller and so on, but the pain is no longer the power to affect you and your actions.
You no longer feel an urge to react to it. It is mere information.
It is directed in the sense that it's ordered.
It's ordered the strengths of the pain signals on some kind of scale,
but it's just a signal. It's not an urge connected to that signal anymore.
And at this point I think it loses an important aspect of what it would need to have to become pain.
It no longer cares. It loses its relevance.
And pain is a certain kind of relevance. It's a dimension of relevance.
Will is a dimension of relevance. And if you lose the urge to act on the will,
I don't think it is will anymore. It's just an information.
And just imagine that you is just a place where signals come from,
signals that cause movement of your body.
It's not me where this comes from. I can tell myself it's me, but it's not true.
It's just my implementation. It's the hardware that produces me that is producing these signals.
The interpretation of the signals is also done by the hardware, of course.
But as a result of this interpretation, I am the story that the system tells itself.
So it's not me that does this.
The elements of the story are being parsed by the system
and feedback into its behavior and influence behavior insurance.
But I am not saying that makes this parsing.
Okay, but I wasn't saying that.
What I'm saying is imagine that the concept of you is really just where signals are coming from.
And there's no you. It's just pointing to where signals are coming from.
And those signals are causing this body to move into different directions
or causing instructions to happen.
So the reason I don't equate this is because I can make this point this concept elsewhere.
And people do this regularly, right?
So you can experience an identity with you and the rest of the universe.
You can also put yourself into another person and experience yourself if you are another person.
You can project yourself into a memory or into a dream of an imaginary person.
And this may not be a useful interpretation, right?
It doesn't have predictive power.
It doesn't tell you what you're going to do next.
It doesn't allow you to control the actions.
But the point is you can do it and it happens.
Many of these people are identical cases where they permanently point their self-concept into a useless direction.
The fact that it's useful to point your self-concept in this direction
doesn't mean that you are identical to the scene that you're pointing it.
It just means that this representation happens to serve its purpose.
I can kind of try to reflect on Micah's analogy.
He just pointed out which I can try to portray.
And I think he mentioned that the self is like this directionality.
And, you know, I think we can harken back to the metaphor that we voked earlier on
of the self, of people, of our individuality.
It's like these eddies in this ocean.
The eddies have a behavioral component.
They have a directional proclivity.
They have these values of attraction.
These attractor values that kind of entails the behavior.
And I think, you know, this concept of people being like these eddies
embedded in a larger system is sort of like how I relate to the Buddhist concept of Anatma.
You know, because when we say that the concept of no self in Buddhism,
you know, doesn't mean that there's no such thing as a self.
It's that the self is something that is a construct of a broader environment.
Muncha came to how an eddie in water, you know,
that doesn't really have, you know, a concrete existence.
You know, an eddie in water is a constantly fluctuating, constantly changing,
constantly evolving process.
Muncha came to how the person is how the self is.
But at the same time, you can still look at an eddie and acknowledge it.
I love that.
I love that.
It's directly related to the tendencies of the physical system to do a certain thing.
But it's very indirectly and remotely related.
Yes, it serves the purpose of directing all the behavior of the system based on what the mind has figured out,
what its tendencies are, right?
What is it as well?
That's not the same thing.
The mind is often wrong.
We might assume something as our own will and actually it isn't,
because we have other urges that we feel regardless, appear to recognize,
that people discuss with the labor, maybe the coverage, and not at all.
And it's difficult to understand our own structure,
the structure of our own impulses and motives and desires and so on,
is what makes our psychology so difficult.
It's very hard to figure out what we are.
Some people are left with no bias,
and they have to think about what their mental architecture is,
and it's much easier for them to converge.
Others, like my dad, are born with no bias or no bias,
and they are there with no bias.
The mind is like Maya, it's an illusion, but I want to go back to what Ramsey said,
in that this is the concept of Eddie's, and imagine your will power,
your will is like a fountain of causation,
and you're noticing where this fountain of causation is coming from,
and that location is the basis of the formulation of a concept of you that your mind is creating.
That's not really real, but it's just a fountain of causation,
where some causes are coming from that are doing these things,
and that's the concept.
I think Daniel wanted to ask that question.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Okay, great. I just have a question.
What do you, constantly,
what's on the edge of your universe that would be maybe knowable,
not on the outside,
and how do you approach those things that you're still trying to solve while you're in this form?
At the moment, professionally, I try to understand the nature of intelligence,
more or less, so I try to understand how might emerge,
what are the building blocks that go into them,
and what is going to come after the current generation of all of this visual intelligence is building.
On a personal level, I try to figure out how to be functional,
and not to be depressed,
and how to serve my friends,
and what are their specific objectives,
and how to approach to the best of my abilities.
And there are many, many other tiny questions,
some of them are in physics,
lots and lots of models that I try to solve.
Also, on a personal level,
I try to understand how can I become more socially competent.
For instance, as a curious example today,
I found a story in my name speaking an extremely funny tweet, I thought.
Give this as an example,
and sorry if it's a tangent,
it's not me if anybody thinks it's boring or not interesting.
Let me see, where is it?
Just to receive terrible news,
apparently you can't actually take your way to being socially competent.
It's first written by a hyperbolic physical counselling girl,
or a hyperbolic physical girlfriend,
and I thought this would be a good way
because my impulse was more important to them by pointing out
that you can't get to the video quality of the test
if you start out at that point.
That's the way it is.
It's the only way that I have to deal with this
is to see if I'm able to recover from this.
Of course, I don't get to the same level as people that are wanted.
But you need to be able to do so,
and while you're at the hospital,
I think it's time for the joke.
It's a funny story about this joke
and I believe that it's been written apparently by a very young person
that has been here for about a year,
combined with the early 70s,
and the fact that this is the only fact
that you can see that this is the terrible news
that your family cannot intervene
because you're not there,
it's probably because you're not there.
I think it's important that maybe
you can find the thing and the life
and the learning of all the people that are there.
So, but you need to identify the person
that you're not to talk about the object level,
because the people that you know are not at that level,
right?
That's the only way of it,
because the people that try to think
that they do know you're not at that level,
and you can't respond to them the way that they do.
You can't talk about what's on the object level,
whereas if you talk to a guest,
if you agree with what's on the device,
if you guys do that,
you'll be okay to start to think about the product level.
And the next thing is that if you just
get to the point,
then the people that can understand
what's on the device like,
you can't look at the object
like you can't look
at the object by itself when
you can't take it from the object,
and there's a question that can안�
understand,
but this is also the subject of community
and it's a good question to talk about.
You could ask what's on
the device.
It's a common thought question, but that's okay, and it's about going back to the conversation.
What about booze? I do want to point out that specific book of the dead. I don't know much about booze, but I have written a specific book of the dead and a couple of times with it.
In the concept that everything is a projection, not the online, from what I understand, that at the moment the dead's a vision, that's a vision, that's a vision, that's a vision, that's a vision.
I think that's really important, because that's the fact that the dead is a vision, that's a vision, that's a vision, that's a vision.
And I thought that was really insightful, because I think a lot of the intuition that people have about being in a simulation has more to do with this idea of a novel or a story in their head.
But in fairness to Josh, I wanted to explain how I think this. Basically, by looking at ants and bees, I noticed very laborious and productive creatures that are performing the same task they did today.
And so I imagine if they had a story in their head, it might be more of their benefit and the benefit of what they're constructing to have a very interesting story that involves love and non-repetitive behaviors.
That could lead to a greater outcome than if they actually realized that they would just do the same thing over and over again. And I feel to some extent that might be the case with us as well. Thank you.
I think it's important to remember that it's just a post-cancelism, idealism, and also of ordinary materialism. And the theory is that if I can translate it properly, it's the following.
I gave this example. Imagine that your brain is not just naturally forming an architecture that implements the self. And it becomes conscious basically all at once or gradually by forming all the right pathways and so on.
Imagine that the brain is in some proto-nescent state and bubbles and forms all these oscillations and so on. And there is something like critical core oscillation. This critical core oscillation is the necessary properties to colonize the rest of the brain.
So it's basically going to manipulate the oscillations around itself by establishing different looks inside of them that it can then turn into parts of the brain.
And be a person and do all the things that you're doing and be stable. Of course it needs to have a stable brain so it relies on living organisms that is healthy and so on.
If the brain ceases to function, the these oscillations also usually cease to function and there is nothing left.
And the idea of the part of the cell that you are in this core that is going to spread out into your brain that is going to colonize it is something that needs to come from outside of the brain.
It's still a material universe. It's some kind of pattern that travels through a universal brain, right? Some kind of oscillation that is stable and that is migrating between things.
And this pattern inside the brain is going to process it. And the universe or our planetary surface at least is full of these patterns that are creeping around and trying to find the necessary brain to process.
And there are so many of these patterns that are bustling around this brain of mind particles so to speak that are the seed function of the mind and then find the sort of brain to take over it.
They're basically creeping all over it as soon as you create a new embryo. It doesn't take long for one of those things to come around and get sucked into this embryo's brain as it is populated.
Right? And the object to die does not dissolve itself but it's migrating outside of the brain and then it's going to decay.
Because outside of the brain there is not enough to take this girl somewhere in the world. The substance is not stable.
It's just going to ascending in the matter around her hue and it's just going to drift around the world. And if it has found, during its experience in the brain, especially in this optimal substance, in optimality,
it's going to bury it and it's found enough consciousness in the night that it dissolves itself with entity systems and basically ends its cycle of existence.
And once it sinks in, more of it gets sucked again into the next new cycle. And the body will also explain why most of us are born again in this new cycle and not in this new cycle or something else.
Right. So very much the sense that the patterns are super interesting to us during our earthly existence. And the most interesting pattern for most people is that the biggest fascination for them is sex.
So after you die, most of us, in all of our existence, are these blown around, look for people having sex. And then they will bury and get one mind of the nascent embryo and then they start to get to the next life.
So maybe that development for now can end the cycle of existence would be one of the implications of the barter solo, I think. But the nascent one, in this sense, is a particular kind of theory about the first and about the creation of minds in the first place in brains.
And it's not completely impossible, I think, but I wouldn't know how to test it. And I don't know how to take back to the theory and write the things. It's correct. And I think it's possible that someone just pulled this out of their posterior.
And so it's a good story and it caught on and then got solidified into the solitude and then got put into this book and there was certain rights going around and then stabilized society. So I don't know if it's true.
And the fascinating thing about the theory is that there are some of the monosomes and other transplants. It's not theory that is, we just comment the same for other transplants. So it's a series feature, I think, of the titan theory.
But the idea that one of the souls is not born.
But do you feel there's some truth to that with the other mind to be able to dissolve itself?
Yes.
But this happens in the single life and you basically enter the runner by attacking yourself and treating the permanent you don't care. Yes, the permanent you don't care, the organism can no longer stay in consciousness and your consciousness is free to dissolve itself as it's done.
And this is basically to enter a permanent in that state and you will no longer do the dishes in your body. So you just try to organize the teachings in such an order that only very old monks go to the corner.
And most monks are not able to do it in a single lifetime because apparently this is born in a state or after an up-generations that gives you good priors.
So you don't need to spend more than one lifetime to get to this state where you realize that you can take your reward function.
So just to consider the idea that you can just realize that your mind is creating everything and then you're good to go.
I want to sort of point out something that people might find interesting which is the Five Ranks of Tozan. It goes by the name. So basically it's a poem that describes stages of realization in the practice of Zen Buddhism.
And I think one of the big things that this does is it points out that it's not like there's just one realization that happens. It's not like you realize your mind is creating everything and then you're good to go.
There's a huge drain for the human being to go through if you are going through the process of meditating with maybe with the help of awakening to greater wisdom.
I think that this is a great illustration but imagine if you see someone else who to try to understand how your mind is or isn't creating everything, look at someone else and their misconception.
One person tells me their opinion of me and another person tells me their opinion of me and the opinions between the two people don't match.
This person seems like they're a lot more wrong and how could someone else's mind be creating reality when they are just so completely wrong about what happens.
If they were creating reality, they'd be right all the time. If everyone's mind was creating reality, you'd always be right.
So that's not the case that your mind is creating reality itself. And it's not hard to say that when you're just thinking about yourself or if you look at how other people have fallen short, then it becomes apparent.
So there's a lot more to realize.
I didn't think that there's so many physicists and scientists here but I'm reading a book and currently it's called What is Life? It's from Schrodinger.
I'm Schrodinger and he has a very profound doubt about what I'm doubting because I used to study our science. We've already had this kind of stimulation trying to stimulate the weather and now it's much more sophisticated.
And then my professor asked me something that just because you can stimulate this doesn't matter. What matters is where you use this to create something, which is where you do something like house seating, for example, altering the weather and so on.
And this is something that what science do in movies, yes, hell yes, yes, let's do this. And I just find out that the science fiction somehow make us have this kind of like temporary that we are excited.
And I just hope this conversation but also talking about it more ethical and moral and what does it mean after this? Like if we are really in this stimulation, what should we do? Like what kind of things that we want to do even if we are in this stimulation?
Yeah, sorry. We can't speak English today. We're helping to create a better world.
Yes, thank you very much. Also for taking me on the audience. I have two questions, a pre-liminary one and a more profound one. Actually also directly to Yosha but actually also to anyone who might have a good work level answer.
The first question is about the simulation. So simulation means a lot of computations. This is in some sense also quite good mathematics. So my first pre-liminary question is, is in your theory of simulation mathematics also part of the simulation? Or is it something that transcends simulation?
Can I answer? Yes. I think that mathematics is independent of the simulation itself. There's a joke by XKCD where somebody writes down the pictures of Kai and at some point they read help and be imprisoned in a universe factory.
This is not how it happens. Kai is self-contained. It's the ratio between the diameter and the circumference of a perfect circle. This perfect circle does not need to exist in any kind of universe. It's completely independent of the universe.
In the universe there's a picture in the answer of a perfect circle.
