# Bard AI Summary: 
The document argues that dreams and emotions are three-dimensional volumetric renderings with a dimenson of time. Your conscious experience of reality is stabilized by the constant stream of information from your incoming senses.

**Here are the key points:**

Dreams and emotions as renderings: The author proposes that dreams and emotions are not just mental states, but rather three-dimensional renderings with a temporal dimension. This means they have a sense of location and duration, similar to how we perceive the physical world.
The role of sensory input: The stability of our conscious experience is crucial, and it's achieved through the constant flow of information from our senses. This incoming data acts as an anchor, grounding our perceptions and preventing them from drifting into the instability seen in dreams.

Implications for artificial consciousness: The author draws a parallel between human consciousness and artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. They argue that for AI to achieve true consciousness, it needs a similar mechanism for stabilizing its outputs. This could involve connecting LLMs to the internet to access real-time data and verify their responses.

The nature of information and its impact on consciousness: The document also touches on the nature of information itself, suggesting that its rarity and novelty play a role in shaping our conscious experience. New information stands out amidst the "noise" of existing patterns, becoming dominant and shaping our thoughts and feelings.

Overall, the document presents a thought-provoking perspective on consciousness, suggesting that sensory input and the flow of information are essential for grounding our perceptions and creating a stable sense of reality. It also challenges us to consider how these principles might apply to the development of artificial consciousness in the future.

The text argues that our conscious experience of reality is stabilized by the constant stream of information we receive from our senses. Our brains render our reality in three-dimensional volumetric frames with a dimension of time, and these renderings are constantly being updated and adjusted based on the new information we receive.

# Bard AI Here are more key points:

Dreams are unstable renderings of reality because the brain is not receiving consistent sensory input.

AI models like ChatGPT can generate impressive outputs, but they are prone to hallucinations and inaccuracies because they lack the stabilizing force of real-world sensory input.
The author proposes that by using sensory input to anchor information, we can create more stable and realistic AI models.

The text touches on topics like the nature of consciousness, the role of information in shaping our experience, and the potential for creating artificial consciousness.

Additional notes:

The text is a conversation between two people, with one person explaining their theory and the other asking questions and providing feedback.

The conversation covers a wide range of topics, but it ultimately focuses on the idea that sensory input is essential for stabilizing our perception of reality.

The text uses some technical terms and concepts, but it is generally accessible to a lay audience.

# Bard AI Here are more key points, organized by topic:

Consciousness and Self-Awareness:

Consciousness arises from feedback loops in the brain that allow for self-awareness.

Computers can potentially achieve consciousness by replicating these feedback loops.

Artificial consciousness could be used to create robots with different levels of intelligence and self-awareness, including those resembling dogs and eagles.

A "Buddha robot" could be created that is fully self-aware and one with the universe.

Brain Function and Energy:

The brain generates electricity and magnetism as neurons fire.

Brain waves have different frequencies, magnitudes, and shapes.

Power and frequency are distinct aspects of brain waves.

Different mental states correspond to different patterns of brain activity.

Psychoactive drugs, antidepressants, and sensory input can all affect brain activity.

Artificial Intelligence and Species Design:

New understanding of the brain could enable the creation of new animal-like species with specific capabilities and emotional states.

These artificial species could be designed to be happy and content with their existence.
Human Augmentation:

Insights from artificial intelligence could lead to more precise treatments for mental illness in humans.

Next-generation brain-computer interfaces could use ultrasound to stimulate specific brain areas, potentially replacing chemical interventions.

Ethical Considerations:

The potential for creating conscious machines raises ethical questions about their rights and responsibilities.

It's important to consider the potential risks and benefits of these technologies before they are widely adopted.

# Bard AI Here are more key points:

The conversation shifts towards the near future capabilities of technology, including:
Storing memories and extending life: through technology like brain-computer interfaces.

Bringing the dead back to life: if their memories were recorded.

Creating new biological species: specifically adapted for different environments like Mars or Saturn.

Concerns are raised about the ethical implications of these technologies, such as:
Disrupting existing ecosystems: introducing new species could have unintended consequences.

Robot rights and responsibilities: conscious robots may require legal and ethical considerations.

Misuse of self-replicating species: their uncontrolled reproduction could be disastrous.

The conversation then delves into the nature of consciousness and self-awareness:
Consciousness: Defined as "anticipation" or "identification" of events and stimuli.

Self-awareness: Defined as having a representation of oneself within the map of reality.

It is possible to be conscious without being self-aware (e.g., plants) and vice versa (e.g., some parts of the body).

Self-awareness is seen as a crucial aspect of navigation and survival, guiding our actions and predictions in the environment.

The "self" is described as a directional concept within the map of reality, always present but relative to other elements.

Overall, this part of the text explores the exciting possibilities and potential dangers of future technology, emphasizing the need for careful ethical considerations as we approach these advancements.

Continuing the discussion on consciousness and self-awareness, this part dives deeper into the technical aspects of these concepts:

# Bard AI Here are more key points:

Self as a Directional Concept: The "self" is described as a directional concept within the brain's map of reality. It's not fixed but constantly updated based on sensory inputs and internal activity.

Consciousness vs. Self-Awareness: Consciousness is defined as the ongoing stream of signals flowing through the brain, a unified entity like a flock of birds. 

Self-awareness involves not only this "live stream" but also a representation of oneself within that map.

Creating Conscious Artificial Brains: The goal is to create self-aware and conscious artificial brains, replicating the human brain's network and its interaction with sensory inputs.

Visualization of Brain Activity: Brain activity is compared to VR rendering, where different parts of the brain generate different representations of the world based on perspective and sensory information.

Overall, this part delves into the technical complexities of consciousness and self-awareness, highlighting the potential for creating artificial brains that not only process information but also experience the world in a subjective way.

This part continues to explain the brain's internal workings in relation to consciousness and self-awareness:

# Bard AI Here are more key points:

The brain is compared to a TV screen, where different areas render specific "pixels" of the external world based on synaptic configurations.

These pixels are formed by variations in phase waves, amplitude, magnitude, and frequency within the brain.

Combining activity from different waves and areas creates internal images, the representations of our experience.

These images "appear" through a constant cycle of transmission and reception within the brain, with higher levels receiving and monitoring what lower levels process.

The analogy of eyes made up of smaller eyes is introduced, suggesting the retina and ganglia neurons act as individual sensors contributing to the overall visual picture.

Sensory neurons like ganglia cells convert external stimuli into waves the brain can understand (chemical, electric, magnetic, and mechanical).

Overall, this part emphasizes the distributed nature of information processing in the brain and how this complex interplay of signals and wave patterns contributes to our subjective experience of the world.

# OpenAI Whisper Transcription:
 
 Yeah, so the big point that I was making was that the dreams and emotions are renderings. 
 
 They are three-dimensional volumetric renderings with a dimension of time. 
 
 So you have an experience of time and an experience of space in terms of where a feeling is coming from, where is emotion coming from, where a person in your dream is standing, where you are. 
 
 And in dreams, that's very unstable. 
 
 Like your perception of reality is constantly shifting back and forth. 
 
 So you have a four-dimensional temple of spatial rendering of reality when you're awake, and you have four-dimensional temple spatial rendering of reality when you're asleep, but when you're asleep and dreaming. 
 
 But when you're asleep, but when you're asleep and dreaming. 
 
 But when you're dreaming, it's not stable. 
 
 It's constantly changing. 
 
 You're standing next to a person, and their face, like who they are at the beginning of the dream, might be different from who they are 10 seconds later. 
 
 Where you are might be changing constantly in the dream. 
 
 And that doesn't happen in reality. 
 
 In reality, the people around you are persistently there. 
 
 And the world and the location you are at is persistently there because they are, in both situations, your rendering of reality is oscillatory activity. 
 
 It's vibrations in your head and vibrations that are being stabilized by your incoming senses when you are awake. 
 
 So your eyes are open, your ears are open, and the constant information from the people around you or the world around you is stabilizing your perceptions and giving you a consistent experience of space and time. 
 
 But in dreams, because your eyes are closed and your brain activity is mostly shut, mostly it's in a state where you're not receiving a lot of information from your eyes and ears. 
 
 And it's not being, and the information you're receiving is not being shared widely. 
 
 And because of that, you're not processing visual and auditory information on a large scale with your whole brain when you're asleep. 
 
 And so what happens is you have sleep spindles that spin up, and they start spinning up your brain activity, and you get lots of sharp wave ripples. 
 
 And these sharp wave ripples are stimulating just pockets of brain activity. 
 
 And so they might trigger a rendering of a face in a person somewhere. 
 
 And your brain, when you start having a visual dream or a lucid dream, you might start experiencing being in a place or being with other people and seeing different events play out and having an experience. 
 
 Like you could have all sorts of amazing dream experiences, as you know, as everyone knows, right? But that experience lacks stability, lacks temporal stability, lacks spatial stability. 
 
 Everything is changing throughout the gene, the people, the places, because it's not being stabilized by our incoming senses. 
 
 So the argument I'm making from that is that conscious rendering, when people are awake walking around, that our reality is stabilized by the constant stream of information from our incoming senses. 
 
 And it helps stabilize your brain and gives you a persistent sense of reality. 
 
 And that's important for the building of artificial robots that are conscious. 
 
 Because we can, one of the arguments that I make later on is that we can make artificial robots that are, as you see the chapter, it goes into language, how language works, it's into language, how language works. 
 
 It's still like, it's higher level than emotion. 
 
 And then the third part is artificial neurology and control processes. 
 
 So, we can, right now, where AI is at with chat GPT, which is like state of the art. 
 
 The AI, or Dolly 3 3 or stable diffusion, I can make art, I can generate art, I can generate text. 
 
 But even there, we can see that the AI hallucinates with the text. 
 
 It comes up with things that are not, especially with early models, you ask it for a question, it can start citing fake references, because it's just predicting the next, but it's just predicting what should be there, it's generalizing what the response should be, and so it can start citing fake articles that don't exist, it's not stabilized, so one of the ways that they're fixing that is they're connecting the AI to the internet. 
 
 So it can go and look to see if the articles that it's citing actually do exist. 
 
 And that helps to stabilize. 
 
 So it's getting new information from the world that stabilize its responses to you. 
 
 Like when you're awake, you're receiving new information. 
 
 That stabilizes your perception of reality. 
 
 I say, no, you're not dreaming. 
 
 It's because that new information is giving you a consistent perception of reality. 
 
 And in the same way, the new information from being, like being a search engine, to give to these LLMs, large language models, like Chatsypt, is stabilizing the information that Chatsypt gives you, so it can give you, and create the answer that you want to have, in theory. 
 
 The answer to your question should sound like this, but then if it makes up references, it's hallucinating. 
 
 If it's able to check its references, and able to go and search for references that are a better match, then you get an answer that it's not a hallucination. 
 
 It's actually valuable for you. 
 
 And so it's able to anchor. 
 
 So our sensory input information is able to anchor us to reality. 
 
 But these language models, in terms of generating images, they generate videos. 
 
 But you can see in the videos that I can show you, if I go to Twitter, I can show you some AI generated videos. 
 
 I think I've seen them. 
 
 You've seen them? Well, no, not probably not. 
 
 Let's see. 
 
 All right. 
 
 So AI will do do make these videos This is a really good, but they're really short But like what it has trouble doing is, um, it's getting a lot better. 
 
 Initially you see like, when it renders these frames, like there's these different, it changes things. 
 
 It's so good. 
 
 That AI video is getting so good. 
 
 Those are all rendered. 
 
 It's so good. 
 
 AI video is getting so good. 
 
 Those are all rendered separately and then someone will stitch them together. 
 
 But like, um, let's see if I can find one. 
 
 Oh man, I've got to get Runaway. 
 
 Runaway is another subscription. 
 
 There's a free one, but it's not as good as RunAway. 
 
 But the point is that it's not so like, when they first started doing the video, it was doing a lot of hallucinating, where it would render the same thing. 
 
 I'm not getting away from that stuff. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 I mean, I've seen the commercial. 
 
 It was like, make a fast food commercial, but all the jaws were in crazy, it was just very uncanny valley. 
 
 Right. 
 
 As far as like, it looks human, but it's not human. 
 
 Yeah, and so the face is not moving, right? Yeah. 
 
 And the nose is moving for some reason, or the ear's moving for some reason. 
 
 Or the words aren't really matching up. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 But they sound like it, it's like the same tonal or pitch, or the same color scheme and pitch or like the same color scheme yeah pacing but the contents all messed up yeah yeah it's I'm arguing that basically your brain is doing like a like a stable diffusion type of operation in terms of rendering reality because we are such constant feedback. 
 
 Why? No it's stabilized by the input. 
 
 By input. 
 
 Yeah, but if it wasn't, your representations would be a lot more random. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 Yeah, it wasn't stabilized. 
 
 Like, you know, when people hallucinate, that stuff is a lot weirder. 
 
 Right. 
 
 Because the brain is working too hard and it's not stable. 
 
 Like, things, patterns are just. 
 
 When you say working too hard, do you mean that like being on autopilot is big work? The goal is to not have your brain be working so hard in order to function and stabilize? For stability. 
 
 For stability? Yeah. 
 
 So you have, see this is, there have two types of brainwaves. 
 
 I would say there's two broad categories of brainwaves that are useful to think about. 
 
 There's slow, high amplitude, high magnitude, low frequency, tonic brainwaves. 
 
 They take up a huge amount of area in your brain, but they're very low frequency, and they're very stabilizing. 
 
 And that's what I refer to as the granite beam. 
 
 Basically, that's your base. 
 
 That's your canvas of consciousness. 
 
 Canvas like ink canvas. 
 
 And then the ink, which is your renderings, that is made of higher frequency, low magnitude, traveling waves that come from your incoming senses, or are generated in your brain from memories, triggered by incoming senses. 
 
 I have a question. 
 
 So if thoughts and feelings are temporal and spatial, are there leftover feelings and thoughts from other people in time and space? Could you run into someone else's anger by accident or feel it? Like, auras? Like, is that a thing or is that a totally separate, like, idea? Or am I not understanding? No, I get what you're saying. 
 
 Just like in a sound wave, like, it has ripple effects. 
 
 Like, if you're saying it exists in time and space and it is a wave, then, like, wouldn't there be aftershocks of all those things? Like, oh, someone was mad here 10 minutes ago. 
 
 Like a tracker. 
 
 I know. 
 
 I totally understand. 
 
 I totally understand what you're saying. 
 
 So what I can tell you is that there was a guy named Hans Berger, a famous guy. 
 
 And he basically, I don't remember who. 
 
 Some of the specifics of the story I'm a little bit vague on. 
 
 I might be getting the specifics wrong. 
 
 But in general, I think they were connected. 
 
 There were people that Hansberger knew. 
 
 And there was a girl and it was either her brother or her boyfriend. 
 
 And if you pull the story up, that would help explain. 
 
 And there was a girl and her brother, it was either her brother or her boyfriend. 
 
 And if you pull the story up, that would help explain. 
 
 But it was the girl and Hans Berger. 
 
 B-E-R. 
 
 And then it's the story of teleportation. 
 
 Hans Berger, teleportation, horse.. Hansberger teleportation horse. 
 
 I'll type in horse. 
 
 Okay, I'm not looking at this correctly. 
 
 You are. 
 
 It'll take a little bit longer to find it. 
 
 It's coming with Zelda stuff. 
 
 Unfortunately, horses and teleportation are broad topics. 
 
 Maybe if you typed in EG, it would anchor it. 
 
 But it's... Okay, so anyway, so what happened was her brother fell off his horse and he either died or was injured. 
 
 I mean, I think he maybe died. 
 
 See, my memory's not stable, because I have to go back and forth to see if it's this or it's that. 
 
 But if I pulled up the story, that would stabilize it. 
 
 It's like the incoming sentence. 
 
 Even if the information is wrong? Well, it's EG, Hans, it's EG, Hans Berger. 
 
 Oh, Hans Berger. 
 
 I was in one board. 
 
 Never mind. 
 
 Let's see if we can find it. 
 
 Here we go. 
 
 So this was in the 1800s. 
 
 Yeah, let's actually go back to. 
 
 Yeah, he was the inventor of EEG. 
 
 What is it? EEG is electroencephalogram. 
 
 That's when you put electrodes on someone's forehead. 
 
 Oh, OK. 
 
 And it measures your brain waves. 
 
 OK. 
 
 Teleportation. 
 
 So he believed in teleportation. 
 
 This doesn't disprove teleportation, but it's interesting to think about. 
 
 OK. 
 
 This doesn't disprove teleportation, but it's interesting to think about. 
 
 And so when he was 19, oh so it was actually him, he fell off his horse. 
 
 On the same day, his sister, far away, got a bad feeling about hands. 
 
 She talked to her father in just a telegram asking if everything was young, all right. 
 
 For Berger, this was no coincidence. 
 
 He believed that his sensor had spontaneous telepathy. 
 
 So he decided to study psychiatry. 
 
 He wanted to prove that your brain was sending out waves, electromagnetic waves. 
 
 So he attached electrodes to people's head, and he invented EEG. 
 
 He's like one of the most legendary people in neuroscience. 
 
 He was trying to prove telepathy. 
 
 But ultimately, the thing with EEG that we learned is that these waves don't travel very far. 
 
 They're really short waves. 
 
 So your brain is emitting waves, but they're not like, like at this point, there's nothing, nothing can receive what's in the brain. 
 
 It's not, they're just not, they're going out of your skull, but they're not going much further than that. 
 
 Cause they're really short. 
 
 So that's how they measured it so far. 
 
 But in this case, that was more of a, is this more chalked up to like a sense of whizzes or like, I don't know, there's like all these other theories about like mystical experiences or like connections across time or like, I don't know, there's a lot of aboriginal beliefs about being able to like, like telepathically like speak to one another across long distances by being on the same frequency, tuned in the same. 
 
 So there's a different thing. 
 
 That's a different thing. 
 
 No, no. 
 
 What I'm saying is that there's a different hypothesis now that people have. 
 
 OK. 
 
 OK. 
 
 So a lot of it's a little bit of a start. 
 
 So people, when he invented EEG, sort of accidentally, he was trying to prove teleportation. 
 
 And so he like- Wait, teleportation, like moving your body from one- I mean, not telep- Telepathy. 
 
 Telepathy, he was trying to prove telepathy. 
 
 Not teleportation. 
 
 I was like, where, I was definitely imagining, like I fell off my horse and my sister was at my side. 
 
 I said, I was saying teleportation, I meant telepathy. 
 
 Telepathy, okay. 
 
 The whole. 
 
 I was saying teleportation. 
 
 I meant telepathy. 
 
 The whole time I was saying the wrong word. 
 
 Telepathy. 
 
 So being able to silently communicate with another person. 
 
 Wirelessly. 
 
 Wirelessly. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 So he's bad. 
 
 Wirelessly meaning you're not in the same airspace. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 I mean, for example, we can send radio waves from one cell phone to another cell phone. 
 
 But the EG frequency is too short to do that. 
 
 It's not going to travel far enough. 
 
 OK. 
 
 So we need to use more. 
 
 What's been measured. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 But that includes the frequency plus the amount of power. 
 
 Your brain has the amount of power of a 9-volt battery. 
 
 OK. 
 
 Yeah, which is very small. 
 
 Very small. 
 
 But. 
 
 Compared to your cell phone. 
 
 OK. 
 
 So the idea that there would be like imprints for. 
 
 So if you're doing anything telepathically, it's not through the electromagnetic brainwaves that are leaving your head. 
 
 It's by something else. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 Quantum entanglement. 
 
 Quantum teleportation. 
 
 Quantum telepathy? Quantum telepathy. 
 
 Or teleportation. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Not teleportation. 
 
 Quantum telepathy. 
 
 Quantum telepathy. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 Quantum telepathy. 
 
 It would be quantum telepathy if you were able to move your thoughts to someone else. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Not your body. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 OK. 
 
 That would be because there is a such thing as quantum teleportation. 
 
 I think this is the reason I keep using the word teleportation is because quantum teleportation is the idea. 
 
 Quantum telepathy, I guess, you could try to ask the question, could quantum telepathy be accomplished through quantum teleportation? That's the question. 
 
 I'm not sure how they're related. 
 
 So the idea is that instead of sending, instead of teleporting an object, you're just teleporting information. 
 
 And if you're teleporting information, it's the same as a wireless message from one brain to another. 
 
 Wouldn't that be easier than teleportation? Well what I'm saying is your telep be easier than teleportation? Well, what I'm saying is your telepathy is the teleportation of information. 
 
 Of information. 
 
 And teleportation is the physical transfer of one object through it to another. 
 
 From time and space. 
 
 Through time and space. 
 
 Well, it's not through time. 
 
 If it's in the same time. 
 
 Like if it's instantaneous. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Isn't that like it's outside of time? But it's like moving an object from one point to another without going through the space that's in between them. 
 
 It's like jumping from one point to another without going in between. 
 
 Without going in between, okay. 
 
 So you're bypassing time. 
 
 You're bypassing space. 
 
 Space, OK. 
 
 Bypassing space. 
 
 Quantum teleportation is like bypassing space. 
 
 But quantum telepathy is like information is bypassing space. 
 
 OK. 
 
 Information. 
 
 But that would necessitate that information exists in space, right? Yeah. 
 
 OK. 
 
 Which is part of your argument. 
 
 Well, not really. 
 
 No? That's information. 
 
 It's measured? No, I mean, I feel like that's already been established. 
 
 It's established that information exists in space. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Like, but then why don't our heads get bigger? Because we have more thoughts. 
 
 Or do the neural networks get denser? No, no, no. 
 
 Is the existence space, this is where I'm confused. 
 
 Yeah, so what that means is that information is the... Like is it a tighter weave? You know, if you're talking about all the ways that... Yeah, so space is, the configuration of space is information So that means that if you have the configuration of space like if you have this is a configuration right a spatial configuration And every different spatial configuration is information But if you have a lot of the same Configuration like an information theory if all a lot of the same configuration, like an information theory, if all the information is the same, then it has low information value. 
 
 Basically, it's as close to get as not being information at all. 
 
 But when you have stuff that's rare, like you have this huge table and one little mouse there, the mouse is rare compared to the whole room. 
 
 So this has high information value relative to all these tables, because there's so many of them that have low information value. 
 
 That's the crude way of explaining information theory. 
 
 Kind of like needle in a haystack. 
 
 The needle has the highest information presence. 
 
 Because of its rarity. 
 
 Because of its rarity. 
 
 Information is only as. 
 
 Information is the novel or rare signal amongst the noise. 
 
 That is commonplace. 
 
 And so the tonic low frequency, high amplitude brainwaves that have, they have low information value. 
 
 And so that's in the background of your mind. 
 
 It's an echo of what everything else you've previously perceived. 
 
 It's all the old. 
 
 And you don't even notice it. 
 
 You don't even notice the tonic stuff. 
 
 perceived. 
 
 It's all the... Oh. 
 
 And you don't even notice it. 
 
 You don't even notice the tonic stuff. 
 
 What you notice is a phase wave differential from that tonic stuff. 
 
 High frequency, low amplitude, phasic patterns. 
 
 Temporal and spatial patterns. 
 
 That's the stuff you notice in the present moment, here and now. 
 
 But that all exists inside the ground of being, which is your canvas of consciousness. 
 
 That's the ink, or the... that's what sculpts the clay. 
 
 So the background of your mind is the clay, and what sculpts the clay is these high-frequency patterns. 
 
 And the clay that's being sculpted is the low-frequency patterns. 
 
 And so low-frequency patterns have low information value, like the deaths. 
 
 There are, these deaths are everywhere, and they have low information value, but the high frequency information, high phasic, high frequency, low magnitude information is the mouse, which is rare. 
 
 And so an information theory has high information value and so that's why it becomes dominant, it's a dominant phase wave differential in your conscious experience because of its difference, its novelty, its rareness, and's frequency. 
 
 OK. 
 
 So if you're constantly being exposed to new information, then you'll be consciously more detailed, or there'll be more activity in the clay. 
 
 It'll take a different shape than if you're doing and exposing yourself to the same environments or thoughts? Yeah. 
 
 Is it thoughts and environment that are the difference here? Or it's because you're saying time and space. 
 
 So is it just your nature nurture? Is it coming from inside or outside or both? Where the novelty lies of information. 
 
 Oh, it can come from both. 
 
 From both. 
 
 Oh, OK. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 So you get novel information from your senses. 
 
 But also, your brain has a whole bunch of stuff in it that it's collected from previous experiences. 
 
 And sometimes that stuff combines and produces something new. 
 
 So you also have new stuff that appears in your brain. 
 
 Oh, I just had an idea. 
 
 A eureka. 
 
 A eureka, okay. 
 
 And that's from? Existing patterns that are like, they're sitting in there for a while and then they find a new information configuration. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 And that new information configuration is so novel and interesting it becomes a dominant phase wave differential. 
 
 And then it appears in your mind. 
 
 I think that's as much as I can take right now on that topic. 
 
 Or at least as far as the emotion overlapping, thoughts and emotions being something of a overlap? Yeah. 
 
 Like being both temporal and spatial, and then also? Yeah, so you really understand the book. 
 
 And the third part, so that's basically how our brains are doing it. 
 
 The third part is how the AI, how the computer can do it. 
 
 OK. 
 
 How do we transfer how you understand and have argued and created a formula, a provable or disprovable formula, based on all that, then this is how you can take what we know, what you know about the brain in humans, and apply it to a brain in machinery without having the same biological appendages. 
 
 I mean, there's a lot of, what are they called? Like, there's always, there's a lot of work on people having robotic or other limbs, you know, if they have parts of their body segmented, but more so like, could a robot be a box and have all the same experiences of consciousness that a person could without the same amount of, like, input? So the inputs are helping to stabilize the experience. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 So a robot that's just a box, doesn't have a body, you could send it inputs and it would have outputs like the renderings that we're seeing or the text that we're seeing. 
 
 But it wouldn't be very stable. 
 
 It would be unstable because it's not receiving consistent input from... It's not even having an actual experience. 
 
 So with the experiences that you have, there is a robot, it doesn't have a time dimension. 
 
 It just has a pattern, a spatial dimension. 
 
 Wait, wait, wait, why doesn't it have a time dimension? Because it's not mortal? No, I mean, so what I'm saying is the robot is just, the neural network in the computer is receiving a bunch of data, and then it's giving output, and it all takes space in one moment, one millisecond or something. 
 
 Or however long it takes to process the data, but it doesn't have an experience over time. 
 
 And what that means is when your brain does it, your brain is doing it like your brain is collecting sensory information. 
 
 And then it's passing it to the ray that's behind it. 
 
 And the ray behind it is passing it to the next ray. 
 
 And the next ray is passing it to the next ray. 
 
 And all of this, as the waves travel through your brain, they're traveling not just through space, they're traveling over time. 
 
 And so your brain is rendering and detecting the rendering, and then creating a new rendering to the next array that it then detects. 
 
 It's basically, detection is one stage of an observation in time. 
 
 And when you have many stages of detection or many stages of observation over time, then you have a persistent pattern that exists for times. 
 
 You have a rendering that persists over time for the organism to reference actively. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 But you're speeding up the process by having AI be drawing from all the input that's already out there. 
 
 It's just about the bandwidth of that? Well, the difference is that right now, in terms of what AI produces, doesn't exist in time. 
 
 It exists in time for us, but not for the AI. 
 
 It doesn't have experience. 
 
 It doesn't have personal experience. 
 
 Because what it's producing doesn't stick around for it to analyze. 
 
 It's in, it's out. 
 
 It's too fast. 
 
 It's almost like a mouse is here one second and then it's gone. 
 
 If it's gone immediately, you can't think about the mouse because it was there for one second. 
 
 It's like, if something appeared for one second for this period, you can't think about it. 
 
 Well, you can think about it, but it's too... What was that? Yeah. 
 
 And then you wouldn't be able to know what it was because you can't rewind. 
 
 Exactly. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 It's like, these representations that AI makes, they go so fast that there's no possibility for an experience to emerge. 
 
 From an experience for the AI? For the computer. 
 
 Or for humans? There's no possibility for the computer to have an experience because it doesn't have an existence in time. 
 
 It only has an existence in space. 
 
 In space being the space information? There's just an information pattern. 
 
 Information pattern in space. 
 
 It doesn't persist in time. 
 
 I'm still a little stuck on it not for existing in time. 
 
 Because it's so fast, because it's unstable, because it's kind of more like a dream than it is reality. 
 
 Or the AI. 
 
 Like, I don't know, maybe they're not relatable, but the idea that you were saying, like, with a dream, you know, think this could be their one time and the next. 
 
 And the reason they don't have a feedback is because you're not receiving that constant input. 
 
 Because when you're awake, you're in time, right? But when you're asleep, you're not. 
 
 OK. 
 
 Think about it this way. 
 
 So I have a representation of a computer. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 And an AI can have a representation of a computer. 
 
 OK. 
 
 But I also have a representation of a computer. 
 
 And an AI can have a representation of a computer. 
 
 But I also have a representation of a computer and a space and a representation of an experience that takes place in time. 
 
 The AI doesn't have those other representations. 
 
 The AI only has a representation of a computer. 
 
 And there's no one experiencing that. 
 
 I have a representation of me that's made out of my hands. 
 
 And you know when people are raising kids, at some point they turn to the kids and say, this is your nose, this is your mouth, these are your eyes. 
 
 And you train the kid to have a representation of themselves. 
 
 To look in the mirror, oh that's you. 
 
 Now you're wearing clothes. 
 
 Now you're talking to your friend. 
 
 And they're making up all these things. 
 
 But the computer doesn't have those representations. 
 
 So it has no experience of itself. 
 
 It has no experience of time. 
 
 It has no experience of reality. 
 
 But the point that I'm arguing is that our representation of time is no different from our representation of images. 
 
 It's no different from our representation of feelings. 
 
 It's a temporal, spatial, three-dimensional, plus time rendering. 
 
 So our representation of experience, of what it means to be a person, is still a rendering. 
 
 It's just a rendering that includes dimensions of time, includes renderings of feelings, or includes renderings of emotions, or includes renderings of what you're touching, or includes all these sensory renderings, and all these abstract intellectual renderings of what you're touching. 
 
 It includes all these sensory renderings and all these abstract intellectual renderings. 
 
 But they're all renderings in terms of 3D phase wave differentials in 3D space. 
 
 And so you're rendering of yourself, the experience of yourself as a phase wave differential in 3D space. 
 
 Now, we have, there's video games, video game success. 
 
 And those are renderings in time that exist and persist for a long period of time. 
 
 But there's no, the only output to that is the person playing the game. 
 
 The computer itself doesn't receive, doesn't have a perception of the video game either. 
 
 There's no feedback loop inside the computer. 
 
 That's saying that this video game, this 3D experience of time, is something that I can observe, that I am part of, that I'm observing. 
 
 So that's what's missing for the computer. 
 
 But what I'm saying is that we can fix that, because the experience of time is still doing what the brain, the only thing the brain does, which is rendering representations of, at a high level, the brain, abstractly, the brain is just creating memory prediction renderings or phase wave differentials. 
 
 Memory prediction renderings, phase wave differentials, memory prediction renderings, phasor differentials. 
 
 And so your experience, your phenomenological conscious experience, which just means your first person experience of being a person and seeing stuff, is a rendering. 
 
 But it's not just a graphical and auditory rendering. 
 
 It also includes spatial, temporal feeling, emotion, and a sense of time, yeah, a sense of time and space, and a sense of, but these are a sense of self, a sense of self. 
 
 But these are all renderings. 
 
 They're just different kinds of renderings, different kinds of phase wave patterns. 
 
 And because we understand that, we can create representations of these phase wave patterns in a game engine and a physics engine, so that the computer, when it has all of this, all of these different components, it can have a self, it can have a representation of a self, it can have internal representations of a self, it can have an internal representation of reality. 
 
 A computer can understand. 
 
 Like, imagine that I'm a robot and I'm a computer and I can have a representation, as a robot I can have a representation of a desk in front of me, a computer in front of me, a phone in front of me, and I can talk to you and have like internal representations and ideas that occur inside my head. 
 
 And like, everything that I'm doing, a computer can do. 
 
 We just allow it to have the same source of sensory inputs or different sensory inputs, but allow it to process information in the same way. 
 
 So it can create internal representations to itself. 
 
 That it observed that its neural, I call it a nap out of it, neural array projection oscillation tomography, that its neural arrays can detect and project, detect and project, they sense and transmit, they sense and transmit. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 And, as you sense- So it has to be a two-way, not just a one-way? Well, it's a loop. 
 
 It's a loop a loop. 
 
 So it goes from your incoming senses to your thalami, to your neocortex, through it goes from the bottom layer through layer one to layer two, three, four, five, and six. 
 
 In your brain. 
 
 In your brain. 
 
 And it goes from the thalami to each of the layers simultaneously and back. 
 
 So there's all this cross track. 
 
 But layers, it goes from layer six, and it goes from layer six back down to layer one again. 
 
 It goes from layer six back to the thalami. 
 
 So it goes from the thalami to the neocortex, back to the thalami. 
 
 It goes from the thalami to the intervertebral cortex, to the hip of campus, to the thalami. 
 
 So there's all these loops in your brain that I'm describing. 
 
 I'm describing different kinds of loops. 
 
 And all these different loops allow you to take a rendering and basically the rendering is passed from here to here to here to here to here to here to here to here to here and it's passed around so much that you have feedback that in which your renderings exist in time but they're also allowing you to be self-aware of you. 
 
 So you're like a computer that became self-aware of you. 
 
 And because we know that, we can make computers that are self-aware like us. 
 
 I'm curious, where does the human drive to exist fit into this? Why wouldn't computers, if they were able to get to that point, or we create it to that point as humans, or you do, personally. 
 
 But what about the drive to create more, to appropriate it to further your own species. 
 
 Would this be a separate species? The robot species? Or if it's self-aware, wouldn't it have awareness of either its? Well, we can define species. 
 
 We can make new species from this technology. 
 
 This is a core technology. 
 
 But from this technology, we can make new species from this technology. 
 
 This is like a core technology. 
 
 But from this technology, we could make, and this is something the book covers in the last section, we can make dog-level robots that have the loyalty to human beings. 
 
 And they have about the intelligence of a dog, emotional and psychological intelligence of a dog. 
 
 Dogs are very smart, right? Very nice animals. 
 
 But what they love to do, what excites them the most, is building houses. 
 
 So we can make giant cranes with dog, giant, not cranes, but like things that, like cranes, but like they can build giant houses for people. 
 
 We could have, we could have basically dog-level robots building so many houses that everyone in the world has a house. 
 
 Nobody is homeless. 
 
 We'll end homelessness. 
 
 And we'll make these amazing cities. 
 
 And they'll be built by dog-level robots, by lovable dog-level robots. 
 
 So we can define species like that, where there's a species of house building robots that have got the intelligence and emotional intelligence of a dog. 
 
 So they love human beings, they're not violent, they're very friendly, and they just love building houses. 
 
 That is a species that can be developed from this core technology. 
 
 We could build eagles. 
 
 Eagles. 
 
 We could build eagles, something with the intelligence of an eagle that can fly. 
 
 When you say intelligence of, like this is based on what is already known about eagles. 
 
 Not about? We can mimic the intelligence of an eagle, or build brains that are eagle-like in some respects. 
 
 We'll customize them. 
 
 Customized robotic brains. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 That's the future of this technology. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 And your, so in your vision of what would be the ideal? Like, if you develop the- We could solve all the world's problems. 
 
 Solve all the world's problems. 
 
 But how do you- We could develop bacteria that eat radiation. 
 
 There already actually is bacteria that eats radiation. 
 
 But this would be based on robots that are used to use computer power. 
 
 They're like immense computing power towards specific problem solving. 
 
 But the brain mimics... I mean, isn't this getting a little into the like, near-Shelley kind of Frankenstein consciousness moment? Of like, you're trying to, you're creating something that is self-aware. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 And may or may not enjoy existing. 
 
 We, well, what's different is that we can sort of, this new level of understanding of how the brain works allows us to create machines that we can define what is to some extent we can define preferences. 
 
 So we can make like masochistic robots? In theory. 
 
 In theory, okay. 
 
 But like the point is you could kind of customize whether the robot would be, have features of, like what depth of self-awareness would it have. 
 
 Like what if we created like a Buddha robot. 
 
 Yeah, that's one of my plans. 
 
 And what would that even look like? Would it just be so self-aware that it would be silent? It would realize the Buddha robot, to make a Buddha robot. 
 
 And what would that even look like? Would it just be so self-aware that it would be silent? It would realize the Buddha robot is a special robot that would realize itself as being one with the universe. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 And would then spread the gospel of robotic gods? It would be an artificial Buddha. 
 
 It would be one with the universe. 
 
 One with the universe. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 It would be an artificial Buddha. 
 
 It would be one with the universe. 
 
 One with the universe. 
 
 OK. 
 
 It would be the real Buddha. 
 
 The real Buddha. 
 
 Why would it be more real than a human Buddha incarnation? Oh, it would be just as real as the human Buddha. 
 
 Just as real. 
 
 Why would it be just as real? It's because of the, how do you define that? Like, what do you mean real? If the artificial Buddha would have the same capabilities as a human. 
 
 Okay, even with a complete different packaging and made of different material. 
 
 Like we're made of meat and bone and water, mostly. 
 
 Well, you could make that argument. 
 
 You could also make the argument that we are metal robots. 
 
 How are we metal robots? So our cells are filled with metal. 
 
 They're filled with sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride, and magnesium. 
 
 These are metals. 
 
 And these metals are essential for cellular function in terms of our neurons have to generate electricity every time it acts with the total. 
 
 Electricity? Like are we constantly? We generate electricity. 
 
 When our neurons fire, they generate electricity. 
 
 They generate electricity and magnetism. 
 
 So they generate electromagnetism. 
 
 So if someone was like thinking really hard, they're generating, you could see that people are literally brighter than others That whole idea like a light bulb, like a dim light bulb versus a bright one Yeah, so if you're thinking really hard, you're more likely to have like literal as well as figurative power Well, electricity, heat Wait, hang on a second When you have a new idea, my conjecture is that you have, it would be like as if you have, you probably have, your brain activity is probably spiking, like I said, you probably have more energy being produced at that moment when you're having a great idea. 
 
 But it also in a sense represents a different configuration of electrical patterns. 
 
 So it's possible that if you are not having a great idea, and you're just having a regular idea, and your information is not in the configuration pattern of the new idea, but it's in the configuration pattern of a regular idea, that you could be using just as much energy. 
 
 So you could be using a lot of energy and not having a big idea. 
 
 Or you could be using a lot of energy and having a big idea. 
 
 Or you could still have that big idea, but you'd be using less energy. 
 
 Okay, so brain waves are not... They're not the same... As energy. 
 
 Okay, so what is frequency? Another way to say it is frequency is not the same as power. 
 
 Frequency and power are different. 
 
 What's the difference? So brainwave frequency is, well, it's like the characteristics of a wave. 
 
 So waves have, like a wave is like a wave pattern. 
 
 If you imagine a chart, where you go from the bottom to the top to the bottom again. 
 
 There's a magnitude. 
 
 And the magnitude is the how high the, it's the amplitude plus the duration. 
 
 How high? No. 
 
 So the magnitude is the amplitude plus the duration. 
 
 Power? No. 
 
 No. 
 
 So the magnitude is the amplitude plus the duration. 
 
 So that's the wave shape. 
 
 OK. 
 
 And then, actually, the wave shape includes the frequency and the magnitude. 
 
 So how frequently that goes up and down, how frequently the wave goes up and down, that's the frequency. 
 
 OK. 
 
 But the magnitude and the duration of a single instance of that wave is the shape. 
 
 Is the shape power? Power is different. 
 
 Power is the voltage. 
 
 So power is this other dimension where how strong that pattern is. 
 
 So the wave shape and the wave power is like when you plug in the voltage, that line could be, the line that represents the wave shape can be really thin, which means it's low power. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 It still has the same shape, the same frequency, it's low power. 
 
 And magnitude. 
 
 Yeah, but when you plug in the voltage and increase the voltage, the line, the amount of power traveling through that wave makes a thicker line. 
 
 But it doesn't change the frequency or the magnitude. 
 
 Or the wave shape. 
 
 Frequency or magnitude, yeah. 
 
 Frequency, magnitude, or shape. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 OK. 
 
 Well, the frequency plus the magnitude is the shape. 
 
 The frequency plus magnitude equals shape. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 OK. 
 
 The wave shape. 
 
 And frequency and power in waves are different. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 OK. 
 
 The wave shape. 
 
 And frequency and power in waves are different. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 OK. 
 
 So just because you have a bright idea doesn't mean it takes more power. 
 
 Right. 
 
 In your brain. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Like, not the world. 
 
 But what I think is that usually when you first have a big idea, it is a higher power wave. 
 
 And then as you think about that idea in the future, your brain finds more efficient ways of representing that idea. 
 
 And so it's the same frequency, it's the same wave shape, the same frequency that represents that idea, but it becomes lower power over time because your brain is like, okay, well I know about that idea already. 
 
 It's not as exciting as it was the first time. 
 
 Okay, so the power diminishes over time from an initially novel idea so it becomes, goes from high frequency to low frequency. 
 
 Yeah, and so when people are like learning to drive, right, they're, when you're learning anything new, driving is just one example, anything new, their brain activity is spiking so much. 
 
 But as they become experienced drivers, the same amount of brain activity that is required to make those same driving moves becomes less and less and less. 
 
 And so you end up with some people who are like, I can take some driving. 
 
 Barely any brain activity. 
 
 Barely brain activity. 
 
 Corresponding, because their brain is so efficiently representing it. 
 
 It doesn't need that much power anymore. 
 
 Do you think... Do chemicals, like... That's one of the things that do chemicals like psychoactive chemicals Yeah, so either psychoactive or like antidepressants or like hard drugs or things like do those all impact how you're able to Like in taking those substances And mind-altering chemical substances do those Change neural patterning or what do those do? Or does it depend on what it is? That can be a different discussion. 
 
 They do. 
 
 Yeah, they do. 
 
 They do. 
 
 Yeah, it is part of the same discussion in a way. 
 
 With antidepressants and psychoactives, and they affect different areas of the brain. 
 
 But they affect the different areas of the brain in a very similar way, in terms of there's this term agonist. 
 
 Let me look this up. 
 
 I'll make sure I get this right. 
 
 Oh, yeah, this is what I wanted. 
 
 So agonist and antagonist. 
 
 And antagonist. 
 
 OK, so agonists are drugs that occupy receptors and activate them. 
 
 Antagonists are drugs that occupy receptors and do not activate them. 
 
 Antagonists block receptors by agonists. 
 
 So agonists, so psychoactive drugs and depressive and SSRIs, a lot of. 
 
 Those will plug up the serotonin receptors in a certain part of your brain and cause a whole bunch of excitement. 
 
 Your brain starts working overtime in the antidepressant medication, those plug out the serotonin receptors in a different part of your brain that doesn't cause hallucination, but does have an effect on your brain activity. 
 
 It does, it can either make you less depressed or more depressed in a few rare situations. 
 
 Based on how your brain reacts? Yeah. 
 
 OK. 
 
 Based on how your neural power thing is. 
 
 So with that, do you think our brain is flexible? Like computers, right? Like the motherboard will eventually shut down. 
 
 But all the information on it could be? Oh, here's the thing. 
 
 So because of this new understanding, not only can we make new kinds of species, but we can pre-program how happy they are and how sad they are in the sense that right now what we're trying to do is use chemicals to sort of like help to stay like sensory implants. 
 
 Sensory implants cause chemical reactions just like chemicals do. 
 
 And we're stabilized by sensory implants. 
 
 But we can be stabilized by chemical implants. 
 
 And I think that's sort of the goal with when you have someone who is depressed and have a lot of medical imaging of brain activity, e. 
 
g., they might have a lot of low frequency, which means they're feeling down. 
 
 Low frequency means low, slow, down, depressed feelings. 
 
 And being at work and being excited and being, this is higher amplitude, this is higher amplitude this is lower amplitude higher frequency higher frequency Happier higher frequency is happier frequency Being at work? No, I mean being being not at work. 
 
 Well, it is compared to being depressed But being at the beach, it's higher frequency, it's happier, right? Being at a barbeque with friends or something It's happier, it's higher frequency. 
 
 It's the emotional like you like I said, it's lower Everything in the brain shifts between being high frequency low amplitude or Look or high amplitude low frequency So so it sort of shifts from one to the other so whenever it's high frequency, it's low whenever it's high frequency, it's low amplitude. 
 
 Whenever it's low frequency, it's high amplitude. 
 
 So it's not ever high frequency, high amplitude. 
 
 That would combust your brain? Or low frequency, high amplitude? That would require more power than your brain has. 
 
 It would require more power. 
 
 Do computers or robots have the capability to be at low frequency, low amplitude, high frequency, high amplitude? Or is that also? Oh, yeah. 
 
 They do. 
 
 They do. 
 
 OK. 
 
 Because they have a wider mechanical capacity? It just has different power requirements. 
 
 Power requirements. 
 
 OK. 
 
 So what it takes. 
 
 And are all brains created equal? Like, could somebody who maybe doesn't have a lot of sensory input be augmented to have a better experience from this kind of technology? Or is it that anybody can get to this point if they train well enough? Like if they did meditation or things like that. 
 
 Is the brain very flexible? Or is it kind of like you're only given a certain amount of chance? And if you mess up your brain with chemicals, then you can't go back? Part of the reason that there's a lot of mental illness is because, part of the reason is because cells are not able to produce enough energy. 
 
 So low amplitude. 
 
 No. 
 
 Yeah, that's a related idea, low amplitude. 
 
 But I mean, I'm talking about producing ATP, which is the energy currents of your cells. 
 
 So yeah, if you don't have enough ATP, you might have lower amplitude experience. 
 
 I mean, you might have a lower frequency experience. 
 
 Higher amplitude, lower frequency. 
 
 You might have a lower power experience. 
 
 Where your cells don't function as well. 
 
 Because you're not producing energy that your body needs in order for you to have a normal experience. 
 
 Because your cells have to produce a lot of energy every day. 
 
 And that's ATP. 
 
 From their perspective, it's not energy. 
 
 Now, from a computer's perspective, it's not. 
 
 We harness a lot more energy than our brain seems. 
 
 And a computer. 
 
 Then a computer. 
 
 We use more energy. 
 
 No, the computer uses way more energy. 
 
 More energy than our brains. 
 
 Because they're... Brains use like a equivalent like a 9 volt battery. 
 
 9 volt battery. 
 
 Where the power of the computer is massive. 
 
 Massive. 
 
 By comparison to our brains. 
 
 But is the computer's capacity higher or just different than a brain capacity? Or are you trying to surpass it as far as consciousness? Well, I mean, what I'm saying is that what it leaves open the door is to We're trying to regulate our emotions Human historically human beings or Cities and countries that have been trying to regulate human emotions with chemicals like SSRIs But we can What I'm talking about is we can write computer code that can regulate the emotions of these artificial creatures like dogs and animals, like artificial dogs that do construction work. 
 
 So they are perpetually happy. 
 
 So that they can experience highs and lows, but there's gonna be a system in place to regulate their happiness. 
 
 So just like giving like getting a boost of medication The appropriate medication at the right time to continue to feel good. 
 
 We can do that synthetically with computer code Do you think it could be like I think it could be integrated to help humans with the advancement of a completely separate artificial intelligence or brain. 
 
 You're wanting to create an artificial brain that could then produce artificial consciousness, but consciousness wouldn't be artificial if it's self-aware. 
 
 Right. 
 
 Is it, yeah, I'm curious in that like would it still be called artificial consciousness? Um. 
 
 Or does it matter? It's just terminology. 
 
 Just terminology. 
 
 It's just, at some point it's just consciousness, yeah. 
 
 It just is? Yeah. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 So when Jeff Hawkins wrote the book on intelligence, he was trying to bridge the idea that intelligence isn't something that's limited to the substrate of humanity. 
 
 It could also be we could have intelligence in a robot and it's the same thing. 
 
 OK. 
 
 But do you think we could augment, in the same way we could program these artificial dog intelligence robots that have a certain regulation of emotion, if we understood it at that detail and level, would we then be able to have happy patches for people? A little insert that would like have the same func- it would be coding that would replace the chemical intervention that we currently are using? Or do you think that would just be that it wouldn't- So, okay, so what happens is the chemical is activating. 
 
 It's doing the same thing that the coding does? At the end. 
 
 So it starts with the chemical, or it starts with coding, but at the end, both are just making adjustments to the parameters. 
 
 OK. 
 
 So this plugs up your receptors, plugs up your receptors, and causes them to be excited. 
 
 So that excites your receptors. 
 
 And what we're saying with the code, we're saying I want to excite those receptors. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 So we're just doing the same thing, but with code instead of chemical. 
 
 Right, but because we are chemically based creatures, we use chemical, and because they are code-based creatures, we use code. 
 
 Okay, cool. 
 
 So you wouldn't necessarily utilize the same tools to have the same result, because they're in different bodies. 
 
 Yes, but the good news is it also leads to more precise tools for treating human beings. 
 
 Because you have to understand what you're imitating. 
 
 And what I'm saying is that so next generation brain-computer interfaces will allow us to directly stimulate areas of the brain with ultrasound to produce the same sorts of excitations that we might have produced through chemical agonists, like SSRIs that affect the serotonin receptors. 
 
 So instead of sending in a chemical to excite the brain, we send in an ultrasound wave, a very precise ultrasound wave pattern. 
 
 That's a whole other topic. 
 
 That is, in the future, this knowledge of how to build happy robots that are socially safe and good functioning robots will lead to ways to treat mental illness in human beings with a level of precision that has never, that we've never had before. 
 
 So we were able to solve mental illnesses that the neuropsychologists today have never dreamed of solving. 
 
 Because we have, with this new brain theory, this technology, we have the ability to, and the knowledge, with the ability and knowledge to target specific brain areas in new ways. 
 
 And we have the knowledge of understanding what we're doing. 
 
 And we have tools of closive therapy, so we can use instruments to tune in precisely. 
 
 So even if you know theoretically what you're doing, you need instruments to constantly measure and tune the treatment. 
 
 So you are very precise and very accurate. 
 
 And the instruments will do the reading and analysis and adjustments for you So that basically you maybe maybe you'll get a little implant and it can make and make sure that your brain is well Thank you make sure Yeah I can make sure. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 It's a long, long trip. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 What's your time like? I'd say another half hour, just for my general availability. 
 
 Do you want to go over the rest of the document? We're almost at the end. 
 
 Yeah, let's just finish up what's going on. 
 
 But man, I mean, thank you for sharing. 
 
 That's a lot of information. 
 
 Also, in explaining your concept, you're still talking about how... Also, it's still recording. 
 
 Is that okay, or should I stop? Oh, no, that's fine. 
 
 I just do more. 
 
 Like, four acts. 
 
 Thanks for telling me to turn off the recording. 
 
 That's good, yeah. 
 
 But. 
 
 I wrote, I said some good stuff that I've never said. 
 
 Oh. 
 
 So. 
 
 I can add that. 
 
 I can add that. 
 
 I would need a recording to transfer that to the book. 
 
 So. 
 
 Uh-huh. 
 
 We'll see where it fits. 
 
 If it does. 
 
 But yeah, so this started from the discussion of the thoughts and feelings being in temporal, spatial, right? Yeah. 
 
 Temporal is time, right? Yeah. 
 
 Temporal, spatial. 
 
 And then from there, you said the next section was going to be about language? Um... And I'm just curious, like, where that led, because I felt like, from what we were talking about, that led straight into consciousness, or like, where it is based on, like, how you experience something based on brain renderings. 
 
 Right? And is language a bridge in there, or where does that fit? Oh, language. 
 
 Okay, so you want to talk about the language section. 
 
 Yeah, because you just, because that took, you said that was the second section. 
 
 It was the, um, language is, um, number 11, I think. 
 
 Right, but 10 was emotion. 
 
 10 was emotion. 
 
 Yeah, so language, um, so yeah, so this is about, um, is about how language is formed from sequences of oscillations. 
 
 Like each word is a different, like each letter of each word is a different step. 
 
 Like imagine a movie, right? You hear the first part of the word first, you hear the second part of the word, second. 
 
 You hear the first part of the sentence first, you hear the end of the sentence last. 
 
 So there's a sequence, that's the name of my sequence, language. 
 
 And sequence of language is accomplished by a sequence of firing in different areas of your brain. 
 
 That's what the language section is about. 
 
 Okay, so it's using the same concept of waves and frequency to apply it towards how the brain is able to comprehend or understand? Is it about language as a whole? Like both the understanding and the... It's both about the production of language, how your brain is producing it. 
 
 And each component of a sentence is going to be emitted from a different neural phase array. 
 
 So what I'm arguing is that imagine that there's a line from your eyes to the center of your brain. 
 
 Isn't that like a nerve? Yeah, the optic nerve. 
 
 And then imagine there's a line from your ears to the center of your brain. 
 
 And so the idea is that there's lines from each of your senses towards the center of your brain through the neocortex. 
 
 So stuff comes in from your senses to the center. 
 
 The center is the midbrain. 
 
 Midbrain. 
 
 Yeah, the thalamus and the hippocampus. 
 
 But the sensory information comes in to about the center of your brain. 
 
 The way the nose works is a little bit different. 
 
 It goes to your neocortex first, and then it goes to the center of your brain. 
 
 So that's why you could have the feeling before the thought. 
 
 Or the smell? No? For smell, I always thought smell was a lot more poignant for people in memory sense. 
 
 Even if you have dementia, if you smell something that is a strong emotional side to you, you probably react to it, even if you can't smell it. 
 
 I can't say your ideas are right or wrong. 
 
 OK, I don't know. 
 
 Well, no, it's good. 
 
 I don't know that anybody does. 
 
 OK. 
 
 But they're good. 
 
 That could be true. 
 
 Yeah, well, I don't know. 
 
 They were just talking about dementia, people with dementia who don't have the same memory space or capacity. 
 
 They were testing out different senses and then in the sense that like the visual and auditory went straight through like the thought pattern at the center of the brain, the like taste and smell being so interlinked would go through like an older part of your brain. 
 
 That's a lot more like primal. 
 
 Yeah so the nose has five different pathways to the brain. 
 
 Oh, five. 
 
 Yeah, five. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 And it also goes in a different route to get to the center. 
 
 Yeah, so four of the five pathways go through a different route. 
 
 One of the five pathways actually does go directly to the center. 
 
 Okay, but the rest go? The majority of them go to the neocortex first. 
 
 They go to the prefrontal cortex area. 
 
 And then they go to the thalamus. 
 
 And they mix up with the interrenal cortex and the peripheral cortex and the hippocampus, which are right in the center of the brain also. 
 
 So they just go to the center of the brain also. 
 
 So they just go to the center of the brain by a different path. 
 
 But they still end up really going into the center. 
 
 And then they also branch through all your senses, go into the center of your brain through different paths. 
 
 And then they all go through your neocortex through all the different layers at the same time and and through all the different layers in order. 
 
 So there's two different pathways so there's direct connections to each from the center to each of your different layers and then there's a path that goes from layer one through layer six in order and from layer six down to layer one in order via the thalamus. 
 
 So is there only one direction that these brain loops make or is it reversed? They can go any direction? For the most part they are feed forward but there is information that goes backwards. 
 
 But the information that goes backwards is a lot more sparse than the information that goes forwards. 
 
 So most of the information is going in a forwards loop. 
 
 Think of it as a clockwise loop. 
 
 So most of the information is going in a forwards clockwise loop, but there's sparse information that's going backwards. 
 
 It's like fixing stuff. 
 
 Fixing it, okay. 
 
 But language generally is, you're receiving it in order to interpret it in order. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 So it's like, language is like you're generating it in sequences in different areas. 
 
 So you have one, maybe maybe one word is generated here, another word's generated here. 
 
 But the word that, so your brain, remember, it's like different parts of your brain are cooperating to produce a sequence of firing. 
 
 OK. 
 
 So if you had like a rebellious faction in your brain, would that flip up your understanding? You had no nouns that could come through your brain. 
 
 Is that possible? Yeah. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 So if a part of your brain was damaged or misfiring and you tried to complete a sequence, when you got to that part of the sequence, something would be wrong. 
 
 Right, and if that thing was wrong would you... Which is like in the evidence, stroke victims, they start to say something and the sentence just doesn't come out right. 
 
 Right, okay. 
 
 They had a stroke in that area where the sequence was being completed. 
 
 Okay, okay. 
 
 So, just like in a building, it's not that the whole thing collapses, it's just one area is condemned. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 For the moment, or it could be rebuilt. 
 
 Potentially? Potentially. 
 
 Are brains pretty flexible, or are they very delicate and robust? They're pretty flexible. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 But as a person ages, they become, like your arteries, they become stiffer and Hard to repair But a lot of it a lot of the issues with aging Will be But a lot of the issues with aging will be solvable. 
 
 A lot of the issues of aging will be solvable in terms of new medical understanding, in terms of how to... For example, you know, like, there are... We know from learning nutrition that there are certain foods that will harden your arteries faster. 
 
 there's certain foods that will lead you to have healthier arteries right? Apparently. 
 
 Apparently and the thing is that there are certain drugs that will like help people to have have reduced artery clottages and reduced artery those things are related to aging as well. 
 
 The hardening of the arteries. 
 
 So the thing is, medical understanding is advancing, especially because AI is helping to accelerate medical understanding. 
 
 People will live longer, or in the time that they do live, they'll live a lot healthier. 
 
 Because or in the time that they do live, they'll live a lot healthier. 
 
 Because we'll be able to be more precise about, OK, well, this is the condition that you have, and this is what you should do. 
 
 These are the types of foods. 
 
 These are the type of medications. 
 
 These are the types of treatments that will help get your brain to an optimal condition. 
 
 I'm curious though, in this like, version that you're creating here, with the artificial brain and artificial intelligence, like, what about humans just being humans and kind of being very... Yeah, we say we're going to take our meds, but do we? Not always. 
 
 Like, in the sense of, we could have this incredible consciousness, but who's to say people would be... Receptive? Well, not even receptive, but like... Compliant. 
 
 Compliant, or also... Participating. 
 
 Yeah, any of the above. 
 
 But also, I think, the part that I'm'm still a little like, not sure about is the idea of like, mortality piece, like, part of like, slowing down the aging process, helping the world live longer, prosper together, and like, applying technology in a way that can be beneficial to a larger group of people rather than a very elite few would be incredible. 
 
 And there's all these questions about, like, OK, why do robots get to live indefinitely until their hardware breaks? Whereas our hardware is very much within kind of a 100 year bracket at the time. 
 
 So that kind of constant jealousy of why? It doesn't have to be that way. 
 
 It doesn't have to be that way? Why not? So the future of medical imaging will allow us to track all the events inside our heads in terms of what neurons are firing and what frequency they're firing at. 
 
 And so future medical imaging technology will allow us to collect the data from our minds to build memory backups. 
 
 We could build robot versions of ourselves, for example. 
 
 We could also restore our tissue and make sure that, and restore our memories and make sure that and restore our memories with into restored tissue like we can make sure that the new tissue that replaces the old tissue has the same function and same memories as it did previously before it was destroyed so you have you could restore someone to life and restore their memories you could restore the whole brain it's a real tissue brain and make sure that the memories match from what they had before. 
 
 But you do it just part, you can start with this, you can start off with just part of their brain, but then you just like at some point you could do the whole brain. 
 
 Okay, how is this different than like necromancy? And also too like, is that a problem? It's not a problem. 
 
 It's not a problem? It's not a problem. 
 
 But like morally, ethically, like is this a gray area or is this just like in the name of science or is this also just for the betterment of our own evolution? Like is this the next step for us? Well, this is the, I think it's the direction, it's just the direction that technology is going to go. 
 
 That technology is already there. 
 
 Yeah, so what I'm talking about is the capability of technology in the near future. 
 
 Capability of technology will enable things like saving your memories, extending your life, bringing the dead back to life if you've recorded their memories. 
 
 And making artificial organisms is something I haven't talked to you about yet. 
 
 I was talking about making like dog level robots, but you could make new species that are actually biological in nature. 
 
 So like the clone sheep would have a brain of particular... More practically, we could make species that thrive on Mars. 
 
 Like a humanoid organism that can breathe the atmosphere on Mars. 
 
 Or we could create some sort of birds that could thrive in Saturn, inside the gas giants, like Saturn and Jupiter. 
 
 When should they create? Did it matter how they would replicate or would it just be singular in the scale? Either one. 
 
 Either way. 
 
 Either way. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 You could go the Jurassic Park route which is where you say, okay, they can't replicate and we're gonna try to prevent them from replicating. 
 
 They're all still. 
 
 And hope that nature doesn't find a way. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 I love football. 
 
 We've seen that movie. 
 
 Also, why would you underpay the IT guy? He's just watching the games. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Or you do that with genetically modified seeds, where they try to make it so that the seeds can't, they can only be used once, right? Or you could literally make species that can self replicate and put them on another planet and see what happens. 
 
 Any questions? These are issues that a lot of people around the world would have with that idea of making new species. 
 
 Because there's very strict rules in terms of bringing new species into each country, because a species can have a devastating impact on the ecology of a place. 
 
 You don't know what the impact is necessarily. 
 
 Yeah, like what would the ecosystem of Earth look like with the introduction of artificial brain species? Yeah. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Or conscious robots. 
 
 It could be very problematic. 
 
 In many ways. 
 
 And also, too, robots, as you said, take a lot of power, take a lot of energy, and are made of. 
 
 But they're talking about self-replicating species. 
 
 OK. 
 
 Yeah, they're talking about species that have their own divergent goals, conflict with human goals. 
 
 And so those are different kinds of conversations in terms of like, I'm talking about new capabilities. 
 
 But what we do with those new capabilities is the ethics conversation and the government control conversation. 
 
 Those are not the conversation that I'm having. 
 
 These are the capabilities we're going to have. 
 
 What humanity does with them is a different conversation. 
 
 So this is just you're introducing the concept that not only is there a equation that you could theoretically prove, but there's also this next level of computing. 
 
 Next level of computing. 
 
 Which is conscious, self-aware computing. 
 
 Self-aware computing that you have. 
 
 Well, self-aware and conscious. 
 
 Self-aware and conscious, not just one. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Did you have one without the other? Yeah, you could have, I think of like, if you have consciousness, it could be like, consciousness is antification. 
 
 That's the word I came up with to describe what consciousness is. 
 
 Consciousness is identification. 
 
 That's the word I came up with to describe what consciousness is. 
 
 It's basically like the signals passed through the whole entity. 
 
 So like a group of fireflies can be a conscious entity, but it doesn't have a self-aware identity. 
 
 So it's conscious in that the whole group of fireflies can act as one. 
 
 It's like a single unified sensor transmitter system. 
 
 Like Sterling. 
 
 Like what? Sterling birds when they fly in the pattern. 
 
 Yeah, so each bird has its own self-awareness, maybe, probably, most likely. 
 
 But the flock, the flock of birds doesn't have a self-awareness. 
 
 The flock is a bunch of separate parts. 
 
 The flock behaves as a single unified entity, so it's a conscious entity because it responds to a single unified sensor-transmitter system. 
 
 Wait, could you repeat that slower and clearer? A single unified sensor-transmitter system. 
 
 Single unified sensor-transmitter system. 
 
 It's basically unified through the physics of oscillation. 
 
 It is the signals being passed from one part to another are causing the whole system to be in synchrony as a single systems that all reacts together it all acts together. 
 
 It all acts and reacts together as a single system. 
 
 A conscious entity because the information is shared throughout the entire system. 
 
 So it's conscious but it's not self-aware. 
 
 It's not a self-aware, the unified entity is not self-aware. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 And so self-awareness is separate. 
 
 So you could be conscious but not self-aware. 
 
 OK. 
 
 And so self-awareness is separate. 
 
 So you can be conscious but not self-aware. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 But could you be self-aware but not conscious? I would say most of your body is conscious but not self-aware. 
 
 Like, your hands are conscious. 
 
 They're able to pass information throughout the entire body when you feel something. 
 
 You're conscious of the feeling. 
 
 It's not self-aware. 
 
 OK. 
 
 What is self-aware? Self-aware is when you have a representation of yourself. 
 
 Self-aware is a, it's like- Is self a singular entity? Self is, well not necessarily, doesn't have to be. 
 
 But self is, you could have a representation of a fragmented self that's multiple pieces, you could. 
 
 But for the sake of clarity. 
 
 For the sake of argument, we could argue that it's a unified entity. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 But the self is a representation, it's like a rendering. 
 
 The rendering of self is not just a rendering, but it's a, I would reduce the self in the small, I would reduce the self to say that if a human brain is for highly coordinated movement, so we have plants and we have animals, plants don't have big brains. 
 
 They don't have big brains because they don't need to do highly coordinated movement. 
 
 They don't need to walk around and plan where they're gonna get their food and where they're gonna sleep. 
 
 Plants just stay. 
 
 Animals, because they have all this highly coordinated movement, where what am I gonna do next week, where am I gonna eat? This highly coordinated movement requires brains. 
 
 Brains are for movement. 
 
 This is not my conjecture. 
 
 This is established. 
 
 Yeah, established ideas. 
 
 And so the idea that, what was I talking about? We're talking about self-awareness versus consciousness. 
 
 Oh, yeah. 
 
 Self-awareness in animals and plants being different than consciousness. 
 
 Yeah, so because we have highly coordinating movement, we have to, the movement is for, the purpose of a brain is for navigation. 
 
 You can reduce, we've highly coordinated navigating through an environment. 
 
 Navigation in time and space. 
 
 Navigation in time and space, yeah. 
 
 So it's the purpose of the brain is for navigation. 
 
 It's the reason evolution invented brains. 
 
 It's for navigation in time and space. 
 
 Highly coordinated movement for more complex survival skills. 
 
 Okay, so navigation is the purpose of having a brain. 
 
 And then self is a directional concept in this navigational map. 
 
 The self is where, is the direction from whence causes emerge from. 
 
 So as a navigator, as a navigator at the root level being a conscious entity that has arms length and walks around, as a navigator you've got this, you've got to determine what is everything around you and what are the causes of this and what are the causes of that. 
 
 This is gonna, this cause is gonna cause the door open, if someone puts their hand on the window it's gonna cause the window to go up. 
 
 It's sort of like you're making predictions of the causes in your environment. 
 
 You're predicting the causes. 
 
 And you have all these causes that are coming from the arms and legs. 
 
 And eventually, maybe you see your face someday in a mirror if you have a mirror in your environment, right? But at the root level, the self is a directional concept that is in this. 
 
 So you're navigating, you have a map of reality, which is all your representations, and the self is a directional concept in that it's always here in this map of reality. 
 
 Everything else is changing in this map of reality, where you are in the map of reality is always changing But the self is always here So it's a directional concept here Relative here relative to there so self is here relative to there and Self is always here Yeah, so that's why I say that's why I say the self is a directional concept at the root of it in the context that your brain is about navigation for evolution's purposes. 
 
 Self-awareness is directed always inward in the context of consciousness. 
 
 Well, it's a directional concept. 
 
 As a directional concept. 
 
 That your brain eventually turns into a model of what's attached to this directional concept of where all these, everything that causes my arms to move, everything that causes the sounds out of my mouth, this is associated with this directional concept of self, which is this here-ness, which is not the map of reality that's constantly changing. 
 
 The part that's always here is part of this thing that's causing my arms and my mouth to move, my hands and my mouth to move. 
 
 That's the concept of self as a directional entity that we start to attach these representations of hands and legs, and that are your hands, your legs, your eyes, your nose. 
 
 This is the concept of self being rendered as a directional entity in the map of reality in the context of your brain is a neural network that evolution evolved for navigation. 
 
 And so that's how you get self-aware networks. 
 
 Self-aware networks. 
 
 But you don't have, that doesn't have to be conscious, though. 
 
 Oh. 
 
 Because, because consciousness is this online, live, active system of signals being passed back and forth. 
 
 It's the unified and tiff-entified entity of signals being passed, like constantly, this constant, temporally and spatially active signal, like the firefly or the flock of birds. 
 
 That's the conscious entity, because it's a unified system of signals, sensor transmitter signals, that are being transmitted and received by each component of the system. 
 
 That's the conscious entity. 
 
 If you could have a representation of self in a computer that's not conscious. 
 
 It's just a directional concept that is more about the data of self. 
 
 But it's not a conscious experience of self. 
 
 So a self-aware network is conscious when it has both a representation of self as a directional concept and all the things attached to that. 
 
 And it's conscious because there's an online live stream of signals, temporal and spatial signals, from all of the sensory inputs and all of the internal activity of the self-aware network that allow it to allow for a persistent flow of information that is transmitted and received between all these different receptors. 
 
 It allows the creation of a representation of a first-person experience, or what is called a phenomenological consciousness, which is a first-person representation of being someone. 
 
 OK. 
 
 So your goal is to create a self-aware, conscious, artificial brain that could then have all these potential applications and potentials for, you're presenting not only the theory of it, but also that the end goal is to produce it based on all this knowledge of how human brains work, and then apply it to technology. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 OK. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Still think my brain is not. 
 
 You got it. 
 
 Shorts are getting a little about the self-awareness consciousness differential, but generally speaking, I think I understand overall what that distinction is based on the directional navigational context. 
 
 
 Let's go over them. 
 
 DALI 3, okay, so let's go up and let's open these. 
 
 Okay, so what I want to do is, so you've got the, let's see if we can get there. 
 
 Okay, so here we go. 
 
 We've got, so the idea is that the different parts of your phase wave patterns are producing different parts of the image. 
 
 Oh good. 
 
 So like, the chair's over there? Yeah. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 So like when you're in VR and you're looking around, I don't know if you want to go in VR, but it's like, it's like the VR is only, it's only rendering to your eye in one interval of time. 
 
 It's only rendering a 2D image. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 Okay, but when you move your head slightly it's rendering a different image that's from a different perspective. 
 
 And when you turn your head a lot like this the VR is rendering the image that's over here and so the idea is that when you're looking in this direction you're gonna see that TV. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 But it's the same as like this is what you're seeing you're seeing this rendering when you're when you're going to see that TV. 
 
 But it's the same as like this is what you're seeing, you're seeing this rendering when you're when you're looking at this direction. 
 
 That in your head, that's what's in your head as a phase wave differential pattern. 
 
 It's different from the pattern that you had in your head before. 
 
 And when you look over here at the windows over here, now you're getting a different rendering in your head That is is distributed across different brain areas And it's different from the pattern that was over here, which was the pattern that you had before So the patterns in your brain are shifting The receptors are receiving different information or you're just receiving them and putting them in different places? Like what's the difference? Oh, that's also true. 
 
 So your eyes are receiving, there's photons bouncing off of your eyes. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 And they're causing proteins to flip. 
 
 And the proteins are causing electrical signals, they're causing to be generated. 
 
 I don't know any of this stuff. 
 
 OK, so that's happening. 
 
 But how is that related to the information coming in? So what I'm saying is that literally what's happening when you're looking in a different direction, every direction you look is a different direction. 
 
 So literally what's happening is your little photons are triggering just like triggering changes in your eyes and those changes are changes in the rate that the cells fire and the wave shape that the cells are making. 
 
 So they're changing the wave patterns in your brain at the microscopic scale and that's cause that's rippling through your entire brain causing changes to So they're changing the wave patterns in your brain at the microscopic scale. 
 
 And that's rippling through your entire brain, causing changes to what your brain is displaying to you. 
 
 Because it's as if your brain is like a TV screen. 
 
 And the pixels are made up of different synaptic configurations that are spread all over the place. 
 
 So you have part of the room is rendered over here, and part of the room is rendered over here. 
 
 That's another good one. 
 
 Let's go back. 
 
 So you have different, so it's like, it's like the room is rendered in different areas of your brain. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 And it's rendered from differences in the, and your, differences in the, in the phase wave height, the phase wave, like the amplitude, the magnitude, the frequency. 
 
 These differences allow your brain to construct an image, internal representation. 
 
 And then when you combine the activity of many different waves across many different areas, these internal images will appear, which will be the renderings of your experience in reality. 
 
 They'll appear to you because at each stage where they're being transmitted, they're also being received. 
 
 So your brain is receiving everything that's transmitted. 
 
 And then you have, like, in any of the other parts of your brain that are tracking everything that the lower levels are transmitting and receiving. 
 
 So there's receiving sequences, or sequences of transmitting and receiving. 
 
 And then there's stuff that's receiving sequences and transmitting mass. 
 
 So there's stuff. 
 
 It's basically another image. 
 
 It's like, imagine you have, I should go into the eyeball pictures. 
 
 Imagine that you have, I don't know if this is a different set of pictures, but I don't know where they are at the moment. 
 
 But I have pictures where they show rows of eyeballs. 
 
 Like imagine basically that your eyes made out of a lot of little eyes. 
 
 This goes to the- Like a spider. 
 
 Like a spider. 
 
 Because the eyes made out of a lot of little sensors. 
 
 It's like you have a lot of little eyes. 
 
 This goes to the... Like a spider. 
 
 Like a spider. 
 
 Because the eyes are made out of a lot of little sensors. 
 
 It's like you have a lot of, but it's equivalent to your eyes. 
 
 Your eye is a sensor, like a camera sensor, but it's made out of a lot of little sensors. 
 
 Little lenses. 
 
 Little lenses. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 But actually those are the ganglia neurons and the retina neurons. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 Right? So your retinal cell, you have ganglia neurons. 
 
 And in the same thing, in your area, you, ganglia neurons, those are like sensory neurons. 
 
 And what they do is they respond to the sensory signals from the environment and they convert that into the signals that the brain communicates with, which is waves. 
 
 And, well, they're receiving waves, but they're converting them to the waves that the brain understands. 
 
 Chemical, electric, and magnetic waves. 
 
 Oh. 
 
 Yeah. 
 
 Chemical, electric, and magnetic. 
 
 And mechanical. 
 
 Mechanical. 
 
 Which includes the tactile, touch, taste, and audio. 
 
 What are magnetic waves? Magnetic waves? They're, uh... I mean, related to, like... Is it literal magnets? Well, it's electric. 
 
 Electromagnetism, so the way the brain generates magnetic waves is when a neuron fires along the axon, you have an electric fire that's traveling in a direction over time, and as electricity travels in a direction over time, a magnetic wave is created from that electricity traveling in that direction. 
 
 So magnetism and electricity are part of the same thing. 
 
 And when whenever you have an electron traveling in a direction, it creates a wave magnetism around that wave. 
 
 It's like the electron is like the thing that's driving the wave and the electromagnetism is like the trough that's following the electron. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 And so that's how your brain, when a neuron fires, it's creating electromagnetic waves. 
 
 And it is the same kind of magnetism that's in magnets, but it's not... But a magnet is distinct in terms of the degree of the polarization of charges so it's not it's not it's not like it's it is magnetism but it's not like as strong as like a magnet which is highly polarized but it would it generally function at a small scale with less, like, yeah, it's not as polarized. 
 
 So it's not as potent. 
 
 Yeah, okay. 
 
 But it still creates a magnetic field that can be measured, and there's machines that are, so just like I said, Hansberger invented the EEG, and that's like replacing electrodes on the head and you can measure the electrical voltage at the skin that is from your brainwaves going through your skull. 
 
 But there's other sensors called electromagnetic, called EMG, electromagnetic Yeah. 
 
 Electromagnetic, and it's a log, it's a log or something like that. 
 
 But those, those can basically track the, they can create images of magnetic field in your brain. 
 
 And what is interesting is that the electric dipoles and the magnetic dipoles are in different locations. 
 
 Which is, the dipole is like, you know, you have like the peak of the magnetic moment, like the North Pole and the South Pole, right? Yeah. 
 
 And so you have the peak of the positive and the peak of the negative, and you have one on each side. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 and the peak of the negative, and you have one on each side. 
 
 But the electric dipoles, I would have guessed, and I would have been wrong, when I first heard about this idea, that electric dipoles would correlate one to one with magnetic dipoles. 
 
 It's very interesting that. 
 
 So positives with negatives. 
 
 No, I mean, what I mean is like, so the electricity is, the flow of electricity in the brain along the axons is generating waves in the magnetic field, which is part of the electric field, right? But it's just a different, it's like a different part of, it's like a different spectrum, different part of the spectrum. 
 
 So magnetism and electricity are different parts of the spectrum, but they're still part of the same thing. 
 
 So the electrons will generate changes in the magnetic field, but your but the You're saying that you initially thought that there would be a similar layout for the polarization of magnetic and electro. 
 
 Oh, yeah layout for the polarization of magnetic and electro-magnetic. 
 
 Oh yeah, and so I was surprised to discover that electric fields, when they're visualized in 3D, and magnetic fields from the brain, electric fields from the brain are different from magnetic fields in the brain. 
 
 Like, the fields do not take the same shape, and the peaks of those fields, the dipoles of those fields, are different in different places. 
 
 Okay. 
 
 And they're not always, like, dipoles are not always in the same location. 
 
 Right. 
 
 They're like, it's like the, I feel like there's an analogy to the sun. 
 
 The sun has this plasma on the outside that's very bright. 
 
 And, but where, it's like this chaos matter. 
 
 Where it's like, where the, you know, it's peaking at different locations and different days, at different hours, at different hours at different times it's constantly changing and the same thing with the electric and magnetic fields is they're constantly changing they're like like this it's like a surface of plasma is but there but it's interesting to think that they're not actually they're not the same they're not the same they're they're part of the same thing but they're but but they have different shapes.
