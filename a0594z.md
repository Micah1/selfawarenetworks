Multimodal neural networks for combining things like video and audio
Is another tool that could
Combine multiple streams of data from sensors
Valve
Eeg, Eye tracking, Heart rate, emg
Eeg, Ecg, Gsr galvanic
Dry electrodes
Realtime data stream?
Denoise the data in real time, 
We will be able to use microphones with deep learning to further improve denoising
