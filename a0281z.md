(oscillat, field)
A particle could be space contracting and expanding at a faster rate relative to atom scale, atom is a vortex of space, like a whirlpool, cyclone, or dissipative system.

imagine that space at large scales is like a time stretched particle field, meaning the amount of time it takes for a particle to travel between two points creates a phase pattern that is space itself

so spacetime on a macro scale is a particle, which is a phase pattern between two points in time.

the oscillation of an atom would literally create spacetime as the oscillation is literally lengthening the amount of time it will take for the particle to complete its journey, and since the particle is a phase pattern that is defined by the amount of time it takes to finish its path a particle that has infinite oscillations would manufacture infinite amounts of spacetime stretching & warping

so the atom represents a vortex in spacetime that is defining the curvature of spacetime which starts to fold over onto itself because distances in space are relative to the duration/force of oscillations. When vortices combine they create even larger vortices which creates even more spacetime

the vortices themselves are each attracting particles, creating collisions that clump like glue.

the particle itself, like an electron, might represent the activity of space folding, between the two states of having a position or having a momentum. 

Seeing the particle as a phase/frequency in a decaying oscillator or resonator, its pattern is not truly defined until it reaches its destination, because of scale dependent time dilation the delayed observation of a particle can seem to define its pattern in the past
