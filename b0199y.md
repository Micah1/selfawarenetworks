Dot matrix reality Photons Dogs

So my argument for self-awareness was that if you point a dog's head at it, just imagine going through third person. Get out of your own head for a moment and it's gonna be in the book. Are you like, just look at this. Just imagine how an organism has to learn.

It's surroundings. It has to learn, basically, a pattern of dots that are coming to that are, you know, photons bouncing off of it's it's eyes and sending signals into the brain. So when the photon actually hits the eyes, there's a protein, it gets flipped it gets bumped by the python that creates an electrical signal and then the brain has to turn these electrical signals like collecting a bunch of dots into a pattern that it recognizes.

And then, so a dog can recognize eventually a pattern of dogs represents, coconut water, a bottle of coconut water in the floor or a desk or floor and then, you know, and so, the dogs world is a bunch of dots that it has learned all over the place, a bunch of patterns.

And when you get to like the position where someone's in a yoga class or meditation class and they're expanding their awareness and expanding their consciousness, I think of it as adding additional thoughts or additional perspective to your existing collection of dots that that you use to make up the representations of yourself from your hand, to the world that you're in the environment that you're in to the the different emotional & electromagnetic forces that you're sensing within your electromagnetic body.

You know. But I think of it as you're expanding your your context. And so the the awareness expansion of awareness within human being to and enlightened being. It is this expansion of information context or how the different dots fit together, or how they are seen from other perspectives that you hadn't reached yet in the terms of your, in the development of your total dot matrix that your brain is collecting data from the universe.

From, I think that is very
