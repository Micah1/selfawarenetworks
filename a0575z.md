this old note needs some work, but the sketch of an idea is there

(synap, neuron)

I had a novel idea for another way that choice could exist at the synaptic scale, 

imagine you have five holes in one tube, this represent five synapses in one neuron, each synapse represents a pathway for ions,
and each path way represents the detection of an information pattern that adds weight to some future choice, an action which is triggered by the neuron firing
the ions are pushed into these pathways like high speed water molecules expanding synaptic/dendritic/soma membranes
when you fill up a sufficient quantity of the synaptic pathways you trigger some sort of action related to which pathways were filled up.

ok so lets say you got 6 ions (charged atoms, like sodium) in a dendrite with 8 synapses leaking the ions out to extracellular fluid that pressurizes a quantity of 6 ions to be pushed into the synapses of the 8 other neurons, but since there are only 6 ions, you have two neurons that get nothing for their synapses

at the same time for another neuron you have 7 ions in a dendrite with 3 synapses leading ions to extra cellular space for 3 other neurons, so if you divide the 7 extra ions pushed into extracellular fluid, and assume that in theory you would divide 7 by the 3 receiving receptors of the neurons adjacent to that extra cellular fluid, so two synapses leading to two different neurons might get 2 ions each, and a third synapse that may or may not belong to a third neuron or maybe the first neuron might get the remaining 3 ions.

Suppose also, to make this thought experiment interesting, is that one of the neurons that received an ion from the first set of ions was the same neuron that received 3 ions from the second set of ions, and that the 4 ions are enough to push that neuron's threshold over causing the soma burst, and the action potential event, so that neuron has received a sum of input data, in the form of extracellular ions, pushed into its receptors, that caused an action to happen.

In a sense it mechanically summed up the information criteria it received from neurons detecting information nearby and that triggered the choice to act.

(wow that is a mess, an interesting mess, but I think I'm saying that information is detected and weighed in the brain that that physical balancing of incoming detected information is what tips the balance of choice towards one outcome or another)

choice is the complexity of options
two people in one vortex
each representing a role in a two player game
it's a pattern with more energy than flexibility so more tearing

every frequency is stores the variable, apple smell is one frequency variable, apple taste is another frequency variable, frequencies are associate in time, because they are written in brain space. So we convert timed sequences into spacial sequences,

the pathways represent the memory/prediction tree of variables associating with other variables up and down this tree.

the external stimulation is imprinting an electrical image into my brain, the longer I look the deeper the imprint

because it's like a net that is shaped by the electrons hitting it, white light hits five times as hard as black light, meaning parts of the retina that got the white light sent five times as much electrons into the neurons, generating five times as many pathways,

ok so if you have 100 electrons, and they are all bouncing around this network, with five times as many white pathway possible channels as black, then it's more likely the electrons will visit the white pathways (deer in the headlights)

even if the electrons bounce around equally there will always be an increased interest in white light because the mind is growing towards the light, because it's a tree growing toward the light, or roots growing toward the light, Phototropism

it's the same reason young people are attracted to bright lights, Skototropism would be the reason old people shun bright lights

in one case the plant is blooming, in another case the light is overwhelming it

so the light, or the electrons are stimulating "growth response" this grow response forms the statistical number of pathways in each area,
