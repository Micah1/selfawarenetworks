this old note needs some work, but the sketch of an idea is there

(synap, neuron)

I just figured mechanically speaking what choice really is, imagine you have five holes in one tube, this represents the neuron, each tube represents a pathway, and each path way represents a choice, and the electrons are sloshing through these pathways like high speed water molecules, and so when you connected all the neural pathways together with all the neurons, you have a structure that has the right grooves to sort the electrons based on the flow of energy,

ok so lets say you got six balls of energy in a bowl with 8 tubes leading out, what happens is six of the tubes get 1 ball of energy each, and 2 tubes get nothing, meanwhile, you have seven balls of energy in a bowl with 3 tubes leading out, so each tube gets 2 balls, and one tube gets 1 extra ball so it has 3 total in that tube.

Now the tube that got 3 pools into a bowl that also has 1 ball of energy from the previous tube, and that energy collides and becomes 4 balls, these for balls go out in four of the sixteen tubes coming out of this bowl.

Now in the process of all these electrons bouncing around the brain, synapys get brushed around, meaning that the next time a bowl fills up with four balls, the four balls will go out a different tube, 

choice is the complexity of options
two people in one vortex
each representing a role in a two player game
it's a pattern with more energy than flexibility so more tearing

every frequency is stores the variable, apple smell is one frequency variable, apple taste is another frequency variable, frequencies are associate in time, because they are written in brain space. So we convert timed sequences into spacial sequences,

the pathways represent the memory/prediction tree of variables associating with other variables up and down this tree.

the external stimulation is imprinting an electrical image into my brain, the longer I look the deeper the imprint

because it's like a net that is shaped by the electrons hitting it, white light hits five times as hard as black light, meaning parts of the retina that got the white light sent five times as much electrons into the neurons, generating five times as many pathways,

ok so if you have 100 electrons, and they are all bouncing around this network, with five times as many white pathway possible channels as black, then it's more likely the electrons will visit the white pathways (deer in the headlights)

even if the electrons bounce around equally there will always be an increased interest in white light because the mind is growing towards the light, because it's a tree growing toward the light, or roots growing toward the light, Phototropism

it's the same reason young people are attracted to bright lights, Skototropism would be the reason old people shun bright lights

in one case the plant is blooming, in another case the light is overwhelming it

so the light, or the electrons are stimulating "growth response" this grow response forms the statistical number of pathways in each area,
