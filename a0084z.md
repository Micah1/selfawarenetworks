your experiences create associations between cells that fire together as a reaction to incoming stimuli, these associations become the means of predictions, when a specific neuron fires, those that are associated prepare to fire as well, so previous experiences become our predictions aka our beliefs about what will happen next, we have essentially a consciousness that is built on these associated memory predictions that network between all incoming sensory data to trigger vast mental imagery that is a result of the neural firing sequences stimulating our kinase domains. "probably"

the cerebral cortex is a modeling system that makes predictions about what is real so as to coordinate the movement of the organism - via Jeff Hawkins

they denied rem sleep to a rat, in a study, whenever it fell into rem sleep it would fall off its perch into water waking it up, it was able to sleep, but it was not able to dream. they found out that the rat stopped responding to threats, a cat could walk right up to it and the rat displayed no fear response. the logical conclusion made was that dreams are dress rehearsal for avoiding dangers and being prepared to act quickly in the presence of something dangerous. In short its as if the purpose of dreams is essentially to have practical nightmares that get you ready for when your awake.

I'm using a combination of neurofeedback, brainwave entrainment, and a very powerful audio visual system with complex graphics in my business to stimulate profound increases in awareness, emotional health and well being, balanced brain chemistry, good feeling, and in general its for brain optimization, there are more details on my website if it sounds interesting. With your mind I think you could give me some useful feedback. neomindcycle.com
