(perception, vector, category) 

I'm in the business of brain optimization (2012-2014: http://neomindcycle.com/ Naturally I would be interested in a mechanical incarnation of the self realized deity Vishnu as my foot and a half tall friend who could come with me wherever I go and work with me. However I'm also interested in understanding the brain to create brain extensions. I have a hypothesis that what I do with Neo Mind Cycle is creating another feedback loop that is expanding self awareness into a super brain, or extended brain. Naturally I want to know if my hypothesis is plausible, and also I want to know if there are other ways of extending the brain. Imagine a cyborg like attachment (with AI) that essentially gave you a brain that was 80 times bigger than your brain is now, except in virtual space? So that your life could be 80 times more precise.

I like how in AN model, intuition is the emergent result from points plotted in a vector tree map that you can describe in category theory. I think she describes it in C and or Java, but I think it lacks the fluidity that could happen in a functional language like Haskell. Where node memories can create vector memories and The model free nature means that the concept is the memory of the tree's reaction in a sense. With Haskell and an 80 core processor one could have each node in the tree creating emergent vector maps with the other activated nodes independent of a centralized process.

I like how in AN Model, the "concept" isn't pre-thought and pre-programmed, it's learned or built by the vector tree's memory system in response to the stream of data.

Micah Blumberg
yes because I was thinking of swarm AGI, or an external artificial general intelligence
like an ant hive where contact with other ants creates a tcp like ping, and the ant hive acts much like tcp, sending out packets, and if packets aka ants don't come back it doesn't send out more, or a slime mold that uses the environment as a component in it's memory system

imagine a nano swarm, that can just fly into a person and take over the person's mind?

unmodified senses

we can expand the human range of senses with existing technology, in fact it's a goal of mine, you say that Luke Skywalker helmit the military is advertising? http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml

the eeg spikes are associated with eye movement, and AI vision, pin pointing spikes between all three, with an extra operator behind a desk. So you have three points being tracked by a fourth operator. Resulting in a superior tracking system, that isn't a permanent alternation to sensory perception, it's just something worn like a helmit. Augmentations to hearing and sight and balance come in the form of ear implants, chest strips, tongue strips, these things can be worn externally, and a Texas company (associated with David Eagleman) is working on sonar sense via a chest strip. In addition to that a chest strip that has wall street information on it, so the brain can be applied to raw wall street data.

Can you imagine being able to feel or sense wall street data in a spatial way as easily as your able to track the events in a sports game that you are at?

I have an artificial synesthesia I gained using the technology in my business
 I was wondering about your sense of humor there 
Now I sense my brainwave patterns

yes and the subconscious is very much a comedian too

what I mean is if you break up your entire sentence return into parts done by different parts of the brain, one tiny part of all those parts is probably doing a subconscious task, and deciding to substitute a humorous remark instead of original meaning  a subconscious reflection of happiness I think

I've got some cool features planned for the website. I will adopt that tip thanks for giving it. My background work wise or generally?
My background that led to Neo Mind Cycle?
I was 19 when the Matrix film came out, there was something about that film that pulled my life in a different direction than I expected. I had planned to be a fiction writer, writing fantasy books at first, then science fiction
In 2004 On Intelligence came out and I read it, then this book changed the direction of my life.
Godel Escher Bach was confusing at first, then I am a Strange loop blew my mind, and so did Thresholds of the Mind by Bill Harris
the three books combined described to me consciousness in a way I had never thought of before
I mean Hawkins book, Hofstadter's book, and Harris's book.

Pawel A. Pachniewski
Very clear what you're saying here.
I have read those books and I actually discussed the Matrix a lot with a friend of mine with whom I used to discuss endlessly philosophy and life.
Not thresholds of the mind, didn't read that one actually.

Micah Blumberg
There is a probably a good reason why you didn't read it

Pawel A. Pachniewski
What would that be?? I hadn't heard of it. 

Micah Blumberg
I mean even if you had heard of it. 

Pawel A. Pachniewski
I have been meditating all my life. 

Micah Blumberg
wow really
okay maybe you would read it then
you know how many people argue that there is no choice?
especially in the computer science and AI groups?
Bill Harris argues that you do have choice.

Micah Blumberg
Do you think free will and choice are two different things or the same thing?
i think freewill only has meaning in a social context, and choice only has meaning in terms of describing the brain's ability to coordinate itself
and I think that on a higher level choice and determinism are a unified concept, not two, non-dual

Micah Blumberg
as if you are the one buddha, there is only one choice, seeing more than one choice is illusion

Micah Blumberg
what I mean is that free will means kim coordinates kim, and jake coordinates jake, kim's mind doesn't coordinate jake's mind, so jake's will is somewhat free from kim's will. so jake has freewill
being the one being is just a perspective, its not the only valid perspective
from another perspective you have many choices
but as long as the perspective exists where all choices are one choice, then you choice from that place is apparently an illusion

Micah Blumberg
Are you familiar with Ilya Prigogine
he felt out of acceptance with general scientists for proposing an alternative to determinism
one in which life is a dissipative system, and because of thermodynamics order increases to export increasing entropy elsewhere

Micah Blumberg
it's like saying the point of life is isomorphic to the point of a hurricane
and we are
isomorphic to hurricanes in the functional sense

Micah Blumberg
so the factor of choice is indeterminism, infinite possible things can happen, and the living system, as a self organizing entiity has a bell curve of possible options, it's almost like describing choice as a dice roll
the bell curve is fat in the middle with things you are more likely to choose, and thin on the ends with things you are less likely to choose

Micah Blumberg
Bill Harris includes him in part of his book Thresholds of the Mind
which you can get from amazon.

Micah Blumberg
Thresholds of the Mind is why I got into Brain Optimization, and Neurotechnology
brainwave entrainment and neurofeedback

and nootropics aka smart drugs too, have you seen the film limitless?

okay well my new hypothesis is that intelligence is like the number of connections in your brain, highly intelligent people have tons more connections in the grey matter, and those connections translate to people like Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, the heads of companies like google who are already using both kinds of AI, as we heard about in the new regarding Google Cat did you hear about that one?

Micah Blumberg
A google AI that created it's own concept of a cat from youtube videos without being instructed to do so

Google's Artificial Brain Learns to Find Cat Videos | Wired Science | Wired.com
www.wired.com
When computer scientists at Google's mysterious X lab built a neural network of 16,000 computer processors with one billion connections and let it browse YouTube, it did what many web users might do -- it began to look for cats.

“We never told it during the training, ‘This is a cat,’” Jeff Dean, the Google fellow who led the study, told the New York Times. “It basically invented the concept of a cat.”

those "brain" connections can also translate to people like you and me who could be leaders of giant groups, like companies, or other kinds of groups going forward.

Yes well if a person has too many connections, or violent experiences, or malformed early development that can result in epilepsy, post traumatic stress disorder, severe or slight autism, ringing in the ears, tons of serious brain conditions. Not excluding the useful stuff like synesthesia and there exists every kind of synesthesia I have been told, confirmed, every possible combination of senses

both neurofeedback, and brainwave entrainment drive connections in the mind, and what I do drives connections to brainwaves, which drive the eeg feedback (sounds) and the brainwave entrainment (light and sound)

It drives more connections, creating more intelligence, but these are not uniform connections, unlike typical brainwave entrainment which creates uniform connections, these connections are as random as your own brainwaves, because they are your own brainwaves. So instead of creating autism, or epilepsy it does the opposite. It increases intelligence while removing cleaning up illnesses.
