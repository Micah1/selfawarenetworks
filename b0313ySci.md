# OpenAI Whisper Transcription: 


Part 1:

something like that if anything were to be if there was an example of somebody																									
having a neural link interface and getting hacked everyone would get																									
the ripped out of their heads almost like immediately right like that's just																									
that's just the fact no one's going to be okay with getting hacked regularly but																									
I honestly think the symbiotic the symbiotic relationship between the human																									
brain and computers is the natural evolution rather than going and relying																									
solely on an AI and these sort of black box implementations where we don't																									
understand what's going on behind the curtain I think being able to connect																									
and sort of control the computer is really the next step and I think neural																									
link is sort of like the first bridge to get it there where it goes from there																									
who knows and we're talking about like really futuristic technology in that																									
regard but I think I think it's scary because it's a it's a new frontier but																									
I think it's sort of like it's an inevitability and we all have to kind																									
of get a grasp of that I think Travis made some really strong points in our																									
thread about it where this may be like next evolution of mankind right that																									
put you know certain people are going to be you know taken you know they're																									
gonna have advantages when they're able to simply recall any and all																									
information at the drop of a thought I guess so those are my thoughts anyway																									
such an exciting topic and scary at the same time I have a question I'll come																									
back later it was like everybody speaks sounds good																									
I know Richard you had a chance to speak so you want to share your thoughts on																									
this cover everyone in the circle back I have two things to say just kind of																									
relating back to things I said earlier so going back to New Orleans so in your																									
like if it can essentially understand how the human brain works like the																									
behaviors like which part of the brain is reacting right like kind of like a																									
cascan you know like which part of the brain is active in specific functions																									
or specific things you do so going back to the consumer market where you know																									
we have like targeted ads now you have something that is you have targeted ads																									
towards you and now you have something essentially knowing which part of your																									
brain is reacting when you see specific something specific product now you're																									
getting tailored even better tailored ads right and it is kind of getting you																									
to like that lazy mentality of like kind of just sitting there that's my that's																									
my first point second point is going back to like it being in children to me in																									
my opinion that is the death of creativity because now you are now even																									
when the child is even straying away a little bit you know exactly why when and																									
what what parts of the academic structure that is not interesting them																									
enough and now you're essentially putting them all in line to kind of like																									
even make them into robots in my opinion and like both these connected this is																									
in to me it's we're getting closer to the matrix if anything and like I do																									
agree with you Matt about like you know this being the next step but at the same																									
kind of next step can also be this you know like us kind of just being trapped																									
in this in this mindset where like everything is being watched and not																									
controlled but like targeted that's that's my views at least I think the																									
term is cyborg not robot so real quick this I think that's based on the																									
assumption that we continue doing things the way that we have been doing things																									
which is which is totally valid but my I think there's an equal potential that																									
with a neural link and with understanding of like look there are																									
better ways to learn than the sit-down and and focus you know project-based																									
learning game-based learning there's other ways of learning which are																									
burgeoning again project-based and game-based to go and basically overthrow																									
the you know the 150-year-old industrial kind of way of you know the																									
ways that traditional education is so if it was that way then yes I could see it																									
being enforced versus there's might be other ways it might be better ways and																									
I believe and I know there are better ways and I think that neural link would																									
make it clearer that the other ways of learning are better and so not going and																									
continuing this in the same way that that short make that one point thanks																									
business right just just to respond to that real quick I do agree but then this																									
also puts the power in the parents hand now the parent is able to kind of																									
dictate where and what the child is going to be because they they know how																									
to essentially like use their brain or map out their brain now like that's																									
that's kind of where I'm coming from where it's like where's the free will																									
of the child kind of trying to decide because now from such a young age the																									
parent is able to control the thought process and manipulate how the child's																									
going to be with a question so how often have we I know I have thought or said I																									
can't turn my brain off right so you know so when it's time to go to bed at																									
night and I'm still thinking about things from the day or things that need to																									
be done what implication does something like neural link have you know with with																									
that the ability to live a holistic well-balanced life and one that's not																									
over dominated by the thinking compartments of our brain sorry can I weigh																									
in here please I just wanted to say that as far as new link was new link is not																									
able to make decisions for you or interfere with your life in any way it's a																									
mathematical solution to something it cannot interfere with you it cannot interfere																									
with your thought process your thought process is your room I would love to																									
time in but I want to give data a chance to to say to say why so my thinking is																									
that once you put some obviously like once you put something the electoral																									
into your brain like why do you think that it wouldn't interfere with your																									
thinking thoughts I mean even if the metal is up and also like correct me																									
I'm wrong 8 I'm putting you out on the stage but like even if it's a metal like																									
why do you think that like putting I'm putting an electro inside your in inside																									
your head interacting with your neuron wouldn't change your behavior that's																									
something that I don't get in the first place because like metal is also like																									
metal is also material chemistry and second thing is that like depends on																									
what device do if the device is only taking in information then okay maybe it																									
interact maybe it will change your maybe it will change your structure brain																									
structure you also bring structures constantly changing by the way also it																									
will also it will also change because you put a metal in big because you put																									
electrolyte inside your head depends on what the obviously depends on what the material																									
depends on what the device do if it's only taking in information and advising it and showing you like what this is doing then like yeah maybe it will change your thought maybe it will change your behavior less but if it's also giving feedback into your neuron then like yeah this definitely it's going to change the																									
behavior frankly I think that like whatever you want to do is just reflect on your behavior and that's like what's what people have to think about like when you put anything in your head that's one thing and then the second thing is that we're talking about AI and humans it will bring and computer symbiosis																									
one thing that we have to think about is that I also change your lifestyle as well for example let's say you have an implant in your head like the only way to change it the only way to debug it is to go to hospital and do a brain surgery like do you do you really want that lifestyle like that's something that we can think about right and the third thing is that in here we make an assumption that the human intelligence																									
basically how how stimulus our neuron is but like so like we make because of that assumption we assume that oh having this device in our head will make us smarter or will make us more capable or get digest information better but I don't think there's evidence for that frankly most of this device is																									
a study on patient who are paralyzed and like I couldn't see a feature like I didn't see like why are we using it in the normal human being and like creating a new human species I guess it's something that's like pretty sci-fi but like at the same time like we don't really know what intelligence is yet like why would we make the assumption of that like																									
stimulating our neuron is smarter and the last thing is about education frankly we were talking about using these brain machine technology to improve education especially in China frankly it already happened in China there's a company I used to work for it's exactly doing that but it was using non-invasive brain machine interface who																									
analyzed students attention on certain things like non-term attention meaning focus so yeah I mean frankly I personally think that like these devices already happened like that's like changing our behaviors so like																									
and so far it seems to have like okay result I think the more important things that we have to ask is like what are these machine learning algorithm that's using these device are analyzing and like outputting and affecting our behavior I think sometimes																									
a company put a machine learning algorithm in certain devices and claim that they do certain things but then like does it really do that like is it really a valid result like that's debatable and but we're using these to changing our daily behavior which I think that's something that should be that we should be more alarming about so yeah sorry sorry I took the order so much time I'll pass the mic to you Micah																									
thank you data so I want to tell you a little bit about myself real quick because this topic is what I've devoted my life to since 2012 so I know a vast amount of knowledge about Neuralink and a lot of other BCI technologies																									
and if you want it if you want you can see that there's a deep learning group on Facebook has a hundred forty seven seven thousand members I'm an admin a neuro physics group on Facebook nine thousand members I'm an admin there's a software networks																									
based group which is directly related to Neuralace nerve gear Neuralink these are all basically referring to the same idea the next generation brain computer interface that that group is really old it's older than Neuralink I'm a moderate in Neuro circuits group and then on an admin in the large Neuralace subreddit on reddit																									
																									
# Part 2																									
																									
and in addition I write software if you just look at my bio I brought EEG into VR so basically medical imaging technology I brought it into virtual reality and there's more but so what I want to share with folks																									
is that what I what I know because I started basically I study neuroscience pretty much since since 2005 and since they're one of the latest things that came out was saying that there's a new hypothesis for short term memory that short term memory basically																									
so so let's say that short term short term memory is something that you need to remember for maybe 10 seconds so maybe like a phone number so if I say okay remember this phone number and then tell it to me and a little bit so I can write it down																									
right that's that's what we're talking about with short term memory but you see when a neuron what working memory yes yes yeah they refer to the same thing																									
there's many so people have outlined many different types of memory in terms of you know but but I think it just boils down to short term and long term memory like you can reduce everything either you're talking about short term or you're talking about long term																									
but yeah working memory is another another name for short term memory and so the long term memory involves you know what's what's called LTP or long term potential and you need a new protein synthesis and a bunch of other steps in order for long term memory to happen																									
but short term memory has been a little bit more mysterious and a recent paper came out saying that well so a single neuron couldn't be responsible for long term memory and this is an old idea because a because the single if you activate a single neuron artificially the																									
the activity is going to last for I think it was like 10 milliseconds of 10 but but in any case it's not going to last for 10 seconds it's just way too short for that so in order for and for neurons to remember something for an activity for more than the 10 milliseconds																									
you what what might need to happen is you'd have to have like a bunch of neurons and they need they need to talk to each other so so one remembers the activity for for for 10 milliseconds the next the next one remembers it for 10 10 milliseconds																									
and basically there if you could if you could have if you have them talk back and forth where they were they they're basically you know the activity is just happening over and over again back and forth then then they the memory could last for																									
for for 10 seconds but you need you need basically what's called a neural circuit like a micro column and this is this is this is probably exactly what's happening so so so if this is true and it probably is true																									
that means that your short-term memory is in neural circuits that means your thoughts are in neural circuits and local micro columns and little clusters and this means that a device like narrow link which is designed to be able to measure a single neuron firing is going to be able to																									
eventually decode your thoughts like literally the thoughts in your head and and because a narrow link is capable of closed loop therapy which means not only can I read it can write it can stimulate the brain it can change the patterns of those narrow firing																									
so I mean they could literally edit your thoughts so we are talking about reading and writing to your short-term memory now this the potential for for misuse obviously is is massive and that's a big concern for this group but the potential for																									
the reason that this technology is almost unstoppable is that the potential for healing there's so many people with traumatic brain injuries of invisible brain injuries like post-traumatic stress disorder so many people with problems like depression and																									
all kinds of suffering over the entire world and so that basically the point is that the the the amount of pain in the world is going to results in people being willing to pay for this technology to continue to be developed so they can have																									
relief from their pain and suffering and so this technology is not something anyone can stop coming but obviously the concern is that people don't want to be you know turned into slaves where you have a machine that's basically telling you basically																									
instructing your thoughts basically giving you your next thoughts can you imagine if you have like the little machine and it's basically telling you what to think and you just think what it tells you to think like that's the capability here																									
now that's the downside the the upside is not only will be able to help people but you could do things like when you write to the brain you could experience augmented reality and virtual reality experiences through direct brain stimulation																									
and you could back up what you're seeing and hearing as as pictures and videos that are downloaded to your computer and your clients you can share them if you if a crime has been committed against you potentially the court could get a what's it called a warrant to search																									
yet some sort of warrant to search the the offenders brain to see if there's proof that they actually committed that that crime against you so there's a lot of things to think about but one thing that that is not going to happen is																									
that technology is not going to be stopped because because the the people need relief from from their pain.																									
That's like editing your thoughts. Jesus Christ. Wait, are we also going to be able to be like like Neo and wake up and like I know kung fu. I'm kind of joking but serious.																									
So this is right now we're talking about editing short term memory with with narrow link. So learning kung fu I guess might involve long term memory and that might take up more research and and I don't.																									
That's another thing. Can I can I ask you a quick question my Mika.																									
You outlined a very, you know, measured statement about the pros and cons regarding this but can I ask your personal opinion about what would be the best path forward like what are your suggestions based on your experience.																									
We're talking about a technology that is you need to compare it to only you need to compare it to basically like brain surgery. If you have a narrow link device, you should have at least the knowledge of a neurosurgeon before using it because that																									
is the level of of how much you could you could potentially you know screw with your own mind if you if you don't know what you're doing.																									
And so basically I mean I what I see is a future is that basically you know the entire world will will become neuroscientists like at people by the time people are in high school they'll be they'll know all about neuroscience because																									
you'd have to in this future world. There will never be a time in history after this when people are just OK with with this technology because the risks never go away.																									
I mean imagine someone just all it takes is like one person to start turning to secretly turn another person into it into like a slave or a clone of themselves and then another person and then another person and then like secretly just build like an army of like of slaves that																									
take over the world little by little. I mean that is always going to be a risk for the rest of time. Yeah go ahead.																									
So what happens how do we how do we detect the facts you know and what happens I mean so with our iPhone so we're all in the Apple platform right I mean I'm sure we've all found ourselves in the																									
night you know the Apple store because you know our battery was dying too quickly or for some reason. So so with something like this how do we know if it's broken.																									
And then how is it fixed. And what are the implications. You know might it bring on early onset dementia. Have you studied any of those implications or potential implications.																									
So so what my I studied these topics. My what I what I'm thinking at the moment is that dementia Alzheimer's Parkinson's that that they're																									
in in these diseases you're seeing basically a new research basically from from 2020 21 is saying that there is a problem with new protein synthesis and both Parkinson's disease and																									
Alzheimer's. And if you give people chemicals if you give animals chemicals that improve new protein synthesis and their memory and their and their functions improve but but but what that what																									
that could point to is that basically I mean I mean it boils down to it looks like those diseases might be caused by sugar but more than anything else that people eating sugar.																									
But I don't think that so to answer your specific question I don't think that narrow link as a device would be a cause of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's that that's my short answer.																									
I'm sure the sugar in this group would love to hear that.																									
I'm sorry the defects like how do you know when something's going to rise and then what happens. Have you looked into that.																									
So in terms of like so OK so there's there's I think there's two I think there's really two quite you have kind of one good question but I think there's really two two good questions in there that I kind of want to address.																									
So one is the in terms of like ethics in terms of the laws the ethical laws that need to be applied here. I mean it comes it comes down to like this is a this is like you know it's like owning a gun sort of it's like owning but it's like also like being like I mentioned																									
like being a surgeon like you'd have to have the knowledge of what you're doing and what you have with the narrow link device is a very potentially dangerous in terms of like you know even if even if no one has given you a militia software if there's a bug in the software there's																									
potentially very serious problems that that could happen. And so there needs to be a court and so in terms of safeguards software safeguards there would have to be you know a lot of there'd have to be a higher standard of a bug testing before software goes into something																									
that you put in a human being there would have to be you know like the you know you need to be able to verify that the software is 100% what you know what it is I mean that you'd have to I don't think that like right now like the current the current																									
thing is that you know there's there's a Bluetooth connection to a phone and that's just right for hacking right because there's a million ways to hack Bluetooth and there's a million ways to hack your Android phone that's too risky for you to put into a human being																									
that I think that you know so the devices need to be more secure and then yeah so it just has to be regarded correctly it has to be understood that this is a super this is a potentially dangerous technology that has enormous potential therapeutic																									
and medical benefits so you know it's like doctors can you know for example doctors can prescribe extremely dangerous drugs in certain conditions for example and doctors can perform extremely dangerous surgeries but not everyone can and not																									
and so those this is the kind of thinking that needs to be done about this some technology before it before it goes out more widely into society I mean it sounds like you could potentially turn someone into a human robot like the way you described																									
yeah it's it's it's both input and output that could be and right now I know your link only works one one direction but yeah like the fact that you described how you're working memory like your your consciousness your what you think you're																									
thinking and that you have free will with could potentially be intercepted in by by an outside force that's scary yeah well it's not that we want to stop that from happening completely like you may want to																									
you may want to enjoy virtual reality via direct brain stimulation you may want to enjoy augmented reality via direct brain stimulation so you so you could walk down this the street and you could interface with your memories basically is you know like virtual reality																									
programs that you can see in here and in and maybe that the benefit to that will be profound and enormous you just what people are going to be worried about of course is is that you know that a program could glitch in cause harm if there's a program error and																									
and and people will be worried about of course malicious malicious programs but but the the same sorts of there is a there's an existing sort of legal structure for you know for for for dealing with																									
criminal activity right and and so what what needs to happen is is people would need to think about common sense laws for for and for and for for pretend for making this technology something that's safe and something that is whether																									
																									
# Part 3																									
																									
there's a pause right there because I am yeah this is great a do you want to share your thoughts I know you are muted earlier yeah well first of all just to introduce yourself I work																									
between 2002 and 2007 yeah implantable inter-cortical even I sure what's going on but we can't hear you I sure the connection yeah try that again																									
yeah if we can't hear you this is probably better I was saying I just briefly introducing myself I worked on a project called brain gate which was like a precursor to the neural link so it was an implantable																									
inter-cortical motor neural project device so we kind of built that between the 2002 and 2007 around and we actually it was originally a monkey BCI that we allowed enabled monkeys to control computers directly using thought																									
and and then transferred it to human clinical trials so we successfully enabled people with like spinal cord injury and quadriplegia to control computers and robotic arms and stuff like that so it's actually the basically neural																									
link is actually just replicating what we did and what other people have done since then and they're the main major major difference which is very significant is that they're making it as a commercial project like that is going to be similar to like a lazy eye surgery type of implant whereas ours was like																									
more similar to like a monkey neuroscience research laboratory equipment with like a cart with like all these big machines that do decoding and signal processing not very portable at all and the neural link is doing all of that basically on a little chip inside your																									
head which is very impressive and but yeah I'm just going to comment on one thing about the ethical guidelines you know if you're talking about a computer I think the big difference is the fact that you know if you're going to do like a neural																									
augmentation type device and it's implanted and you don't you will no longer have the option of not using it for example so like you know that might be the best ethical type of thing like a physical on off switch																									
which I'm very very unlikely once they once they have you they tend not to want to let that go but for example with an iphone or a computer you can just turn it off and just leave it at home or something with the neural link you will not be able to do that and I think that's where you																									
really need to have ethical guidelines where it's not just like Facebook or Gmail that reads all of your direct messages and personal documents things like that there will have to be some kind of a little bit more stringent I mean I shouldn't say there will have to be																									
I would say in an ideal world there would be more stringent ethical and privacy guidelines in the more in most likelihood like there's won't be and we're just going to have to you know whatever and like the extreme cases like what Mike I was saying when there is like a subpoena or a criminal																									
investigation they're just going to be able to you know it's going to be a U.S. company the government will just be able to subpoena whatever they want I also just wanted to differentiate between the kind of short term and medium term prospects versus like longer																									
terms like anything about like thoughts and decoding thoughts and stuff like that that's like more like medium to long term in the short term it's going to be basically moving a cursor on the screen maybe typing typing things out very rudimentary typing and things like that and it's just important to know like that that is where they're at now and																									
probably it will go next to like maybe auditory and neural prostheses or visual prostheses and things like that and maybe some treatments of like some motor disease like Parkinson's or you know those kind of things and then yeah I think it is definitely true that there will be things related to thoughts																									
and memory and I will probably come in like the 10 to 15 year time resin or maybe maybe like 7 to 10 year but those aren't coming like right around the corner and I can speak to like actual how those things work in the motor neuroscience and decoding from populations of neurons in the motor cortex																									
which is pretty interesting stuff but yeah so that's it. You touched on some really interesting areas and I'd love to dive into one in particular was around like the regulation like the way I you know like from hearing you must talk about this																									
you know let me use the analogy of like let's say we alien space invasion or like the movie Independence Day if we knew that there was going to be like this superior species that was going to invade Earth or visit planet Earth and we had to like an advance warning of it																									
10, 20, 30 years in advance you know we would probably rush to prepare for that situation maybe and my guess is that he's viewing AI as essentially that and that regulation seems to be always a thing that comes after something catastrophic happens and the damage is done																									
and we pursue regulation and that idea of pursuing regulation after the innovation has you know played itself out a bit to see it's the edges of where it might want to we might want to safeguard this new tech that process of regulation being a laggard is a bad one																									
and also essentially the only way to combat this invasion of AI is us also kind of rushing on the speeding train towards becoming a cyborg and that's essentially you know the only thing that he sees as a path forward and that's kind of what I'm hearing																									
I don't know I'd love to hear your thoughts and see if that's what you're essentially saying as well.																									
Can I add can I add something to want to reply? Well I just to answer Travis's question first so I think Travis I think well I think the first thing I would respond to that is like there's a lot of hype around AI and different things like that and you know aliens and																									
like things like this like I don't know I think it's important to look at like what what we're talking about is like decoding the let's say motor intention from the from the brain and whether using AI or using like different types of like single processing or real time.																									
There are all kinds of algorithms and different control system types of decoding mathematical ways of doing it's not just AI and I think it's important to just like just kind of like look at all these different aspects of like neural interfaces.																									
I guess sorry so yeah so I was personally I think we're regarding like the ethical guidelines. I think it's also important to differentiate this like just because you're doing a neural interface doesn't it's not that different.																									
I think that's one thing I really agree with what Elon when Elon Musk talks about this and he says that you know this is like we have a neural interface right now.																									
You know we have we have a keyboard we have phone we have a mobile phone with direct access to the Internet with like hundreds of gigs of memory and pictures and facial identification and Wikipedia and email that that's a neural interface.																									
You know you're using your thumbs and you're connecting it to a mega database of like real time AI and all kinds of like single processing and everything at your fingertips.																									
It's just a very slow bandwidth between your thoughts and then the computer systems that are connected to the Internet that can pretty much connect any other computer system all around the world faster than your eyes can register it in the microsecond millisecond range.																									
So we already we're I'm talking to you right with a neural interface that is sending my voice to your ears. It's not really neural direct neural interface but like so it's just a very slow bandwidth.																									
And I think my point there is the fact that we don't need to wait till we have a neural interface to have better ethical guidelines.																									
We in my opinion like why don't we start with the current interface which is like using a computer like right now we're using this app and we're using an iPhone and we don't have any control over the privacy or like ethical guidelines on those systems.																									
Why don't we just try to get those regulatory because in my opinion I'm saying that we should do that.																									
We don't have a lot of faith in the companies and in the government that they're going to do that. And then the issue that I'm concerned about is like now when you have it implanted now you don't have the chance to turn it off.																									
You know it's just implanted and now they they just have you in your own brain and it's kind of like we should in my opinion that should be like a big flag or a milestone where it's like let's put the brakes on it now.																									
We should also work backwards into Facebook into Gmail and things like that.																									
May I respond to Abe?																									
Sure.																									
Okay so Abe's work is extremely legit like what Abe has done in terms of intracortical implants.																									
ECOG and I don't know if you're also working with STERI or EEG or DBS.																									
It was an intracortical. It was not ECOG. ECOG is on the surface of the brain and intracortical is the actual implanted with like listening to the actual neurons firing and firing rates of individual and populations of individual neurons.																									
And just by the way so people know it was a nature paper. I was a co-author on a nature paper and my claim to fame is that I was actually on the cover of Nature in July of 2013.																									
What was the name of the paper so we can all look it up and were you working with DBS?																									
I think my divorce has just been signed up there now.																									
Sorry?																									
Were you working with DBS and also can you say the name of the nature paper so we can all look it up?																									
If you just go to nature.com and you go to like or yeah it's Neural Prosthetic and it's under Hockberg if you look that up H-O-C-H-B-E-R-G.																									
H-O-C-H-B-R-G?																									
H-O-C-H-O-C-B-E-R-G and just look up Neural Prosthetic.																									
Okay.																									
H-O-C-H.																									
Was it called Neural Ensemble Control of Prosthetic Devices?																									
Yeah Neural, yeah it's just like Google Neuronal, yeah Neuronal Prosthetic Hockberg it'll come up. H-O-C-H-B-E-R-G.																									
Was it a 2006 paper?																									
That's the 2006, yeah there was another one in 2002 which was the monkey controlling the computer and then in 2006 it was the human controlling and yeah.																									
You can look up that whole edition of Nature in July 13th 2006 has a whole set of articles and editorials.																									
This was an actual published article and then there was like editorials and other documents about Neural Prosthetic.																									
It's pretty interesting.																									
I did work with DBS in the sense that like our preliminary test we did before we had the FDA IDE clinical approval to do the device testing in our own trial.																									
We actually piggybacked on a implanting DBS.																									
There's a technique where in order to target the exact location of the DBS electrodes you can use electrodes that they normally put in deep in the brain to find the exact spot where you want the DBS implanted.																									
So we stopped those electrodes on the surface of the brain.																									
It's made by a company called Alpha Omega as an Israeli company and we actually modified their system to do a real-time decoding and control allowing patients in the OR while they had their brain open for the DBS implantation.																									
We got the patient's consent and IRB approval to do a closed loop real-time system in the OR.																									
So I was working with patients in the OR getting a DBS implant.																									
But we didn't work on DBS but we used that OR time.																									
So how close were we able to get to measuring single neuron spikes?																									
And I ask that because I guess one of the major differences that people have been saying about Neuralink is that when you measure single neuron spikes you're talking about a new order of magnitude of resolution potentially for medical imaging that just doesn't exist in many other devices.																									
I mean that's what we did. It's pretty standard in monkeys back until the mid-90s or early 90s.																									
We were doing it in humans in 2004 or 2005 and it was basically spike trains.																									
We're recording from between five to a couple hundred neurons in parallel at the same time and you're getting the full spike trains with fine timing, the exact microsecond spike timing.																									
																									
# Part 4																									
																									
So you're talking about electrode arrays that were implanted in monkeys, for example?																									
In humans. We had electrode arrays in human motor cortex and decoding the spiking activity of populations of neurons in real-time.																									
And so do you feel that we're getting anything new in terms of the resolution or capabilities with Neuralink?																									
I'm just interested to hear your thoughts on that.																									
Definitely. Their technology is generations ahead of what we did.																									
I think from what I gather, their first experiment is pretty, they're setting a very low threshold and very easy thing to succeed because it's been done, it was done in 2004.																									
This is not a complicated thing in terms of the technology in terms of replicating it because all they're doing is doing a kind of control of an iPhone or a computer.																									
Their technology is way more sophisticated and my understanding is there's like thousands, I believe, in their current version one, it's going to be like a thousand plus real-time decoding, real-time neuron.																									
I think the current number is over 3,000 but the device is potentially capable of over more than 10,000.																									
Yeah, and ours was maximum, it's called the Utah Array, that's like the classic array that name is called the Utah Array, it's 100 electrons on a silicon, it's actually like a rigid and stable.																									
90 cents.																									
It's a rigid electrode on a silicon wafer so there's like a 10 by 10 array and it's just about 4 millimeters deep in the cortex and you just tap it right onto the surface of the cortex and just the tips of them are coated in metal so that has like an ability to record the electrical activity.																									
It's a very tiny electrode that can just pick up just the field around the tip which is basically picking up the actual neuronal pattern near the neurons that are nearby the tips of those electrodes.																									
But when you stick a Utah Array into a human brain, it looks like a square with a bunch of spikes, we're puncturing a lot of blood vessels, causing a lot of damage and then scarring happens and then it stops working, is it right?																									
It lasted, I think the maximum was like a couple of years and there's not a lot of scarring, I mean there's a tiny amount of, you know, it takes I think like a week or two to heal after the brain surgery which is fairly common and it's just like the first time you plug it in, it starts working.																									
Yeah but definitely the neural link is less invasive because they actually use these tiny wires and they just thread it in very precisely, this thing is like more invasive but you just avoid any major capillaries and arteries.																									
So were you able to send stimulation and do closed loop therapies?																									
We weren't doing stimulation but you can, the neural, in fact the Utah Array was originally developed to do a cortical stimulation in the visual cortex and they did it and you get like phosphine and things like that, it didn't, you can stimulate with the Utah Array, we didn't, in our system we only recorded from the primary motor cortex.																									
Can you be very specific about which pin the stimulation is coming from in the Utah Array or is it just like the whole thing at once?																									
Well, any of them, you can just send current into any of them, it's just an electrode so you can record or stimulate.																									
Very cool, so one of the things, I think what I'm getting may be very specific, I am looking, I'm seeing like there's some attrition, so like if maybe we want to get more general, I don't know if people are interested in this level of detail, I mean I like talking about it.																									
I just thought of a question.																									
Oh, okay. I was in the Donahue lab at Brown and then we, and they were the ones who were, I mean Donahue was a quite amazing, prominent motor neuroscience researcher from back in like the 80s and 70s and he was basically doing monkey, you know, motor neuroscience research for a long time.																									
And yeah, that's where they did the initial monkey closed loop intracortical system and then he started a company called Cyberkinetics, so I joined that company, I was kind of like the first employee hired and then we merged with a company in Utah that developed Utah Array and also the amplifiers and decoding systems and they still exist and sell those systems for neuroscience research as well as like clinical epilepsy research and things like that.																									
Yeah, I know, I think like some of the labs that I participated in actually used Utah Array. There are some electrode failures and also like I think Mike also pointed out that there's also a risk of edema when you're puncturing blood vessel, but I think like they're kind of widely used for brain computer interface.																									
Yeah, a lot of people have used them now and it's been widely replicated. In fact, there are people who have used like they implant multiple Utah Arrays in different parts of the brain and then they decode, they use it for like, they have demonstrated it to be used for hand and arm robotic prostheses.																									
There's someone who loses their arm, like a veteran had their arm, you know, amputated and then they put a very highly dexterous robotic arm. You can see these demos like on YouTube and they decode the, they don't usually use a brain computer interface for those but they have demonstrated the ability to use a brain interface to control the fingers and hands of a complete robot and like hand and arm with like 25, 27 degrees of freedom.																									
So, you know, you guys are have like really interesting conversation. I just want to remind you though, there's a lot of folks who don't have, I guess some of the technical details that you guys are referencing.																									
Could you perhaps just for everyone in the audience, can explain in layman's term what is the Utah Array and how to get the sense that it's different from what your link is using? Could maybe you could maybe explain that a little bit more. I would love to understand that.																									
Yeah, a little PTR, I really like that. Yeah, basically Utah Array is like, it's kind of, you can think of it as a traditional intracortical electrode, you can see it.																									
Sorry. So PTR means once Abe uploads his picture, you're going to pull down the screen to refresh, to see his new picture.																									
Yeah, basically the Utah Array, and this is actually from the nature paper. So yeah, so, yeah, you're sick.																									
So that's what it looks like. It's basically a, well, just one more second, sorry, uploading, I guess. Yeah, it's basically, you can PTR now, and then you'll see the Utah Array.																									
It's basically like, you can think of it, I mean, for lack of a better term, a bed of nails, so to speak. It's basically a silicon wafer, four millimeters by four millimeters, and one millimeter in height, and then it's edged out.																									
So there are 100 electrodes, 10 by 10 array, and I don't know if people are familiar with like semiconductor edging, but it's like a MEMS device.																									
So it's kind of like a silicon wafer, like a computer chip, and then it's basically, every electrode is just like a millimeter, sorry, did I say, yeah, basically it's four millimeter by four millimeter in the square, and then the electrodes are one millimeter in height.																									
So the electrode goes one millimeter deep into the cortex, which is just the correct and required depth to reach the neurons.																									
And if anyone's more familiar than I am with motor neuroscience, but there's a specific neuronal cells in the motor cortex, and the cell, the actual cell body is right around that later.																									
So we're actually recording from the ideal depth in that, using that system, and basically it's very different from neural link in the sense that it's a rigid, it's like one flat surface that the electrodes tips are all at the same depth, and it's just what happens to work pretty well,																									
but you don't have any variability, you can't just like place the electrodes in particular spots.																									
So you just kind of like put it there, and then it works in all the patients, so that was good.																									
But if you can think of it as a rudimentary system that was more developed through monkey neuroscience research.																									
Maybe I can create a more…																									
Sorry, just wanted to ask, how many neurons can this one chip reach at this moment?																									
What's the maximum amount of neurons that these chips can reach?																									
In theory, every electrode can actually record from more than one neuron, because if you have an electrode tip, and then there can be multiple neurons around the electrode, and then you basically see different…																									
Every neuron has a different pattern of the action potential, so you can actually see multiple neurons around the tip of an electrode.																									
So in theory, you can have like 200 to 300 neurons, but in practice, it would typically range due to like possible scarring or possible, you know, not proximity to a neuron or something like that,																									
or just a broken electrode, which can happen as unlikely, but back when we did it in the first, first, first times, which was like 2004 or 2005,																									
this is important to note, I'm talking about like some pretty old thing, like 15 years ago.																									
But back in those times, it was like probably more like between 20 to like 100, so that was pretty constant.																									
And what is it currently right now? Do you know, like with the current amount?																									
It should be around 150, I would probably estimate.																									
Oh, we haven't reached a thousand yet?																									
Well, no, the neural link will be different, and the neural link, they're actually going to be inserting wires, like tiny filament wires,																									
and targeting everyone will be implanted by a robot that's targeting specific neurons,																									
and they can implant like a couple thousand, probably 3,000 into the specific area in the brain individually.																									
And then I think they can actually record from multiple neurons.																									
For each wire, you can actually record multiple neuronal recording sites and stimulate.																									
So it's like orders of magnitude more neurons, and you're able to place them precisely.																									
So the Utah Ray was like, like I said, like a flat sheet of like 100 recording electrodes,																									
and you get whatever you get when you implant it, whereas the neural link is like precisely implanting 3,000 individually.																									
So to clarify, I think like the best metaphor that actually worked for me when I was working,																									
at least like volunteering some of the lapses, is that it's like dropping a mic in the middle of the stadium.																									
So what these electrodes are doing is kind of like listening into different neurons talking,																									
but there are, like I guess like one of the novelties of neural link is that they're able to do spike sorting,																									
or a mechanism that actually differentiates like which neuron is firing at which location,																									
then you can essentially decode the neural information as to like which neuron is like firing at what rate.																									
So it's like, like I said, to go back to my analogy of dropping a mic in the middle of a stadium,																									
it's like you're trying to discern which person is talking based on their voices,																									
but the only instrument that you have is the mic.																									
So what these electrodes are doing, even though they're not recording for a single neuron,																									
but due to different clustering tech or like by applying different clustering techniques,																									
you can actually decode which how many neurons you have in the constellation where these electrodes are implanted.																									
Well, you get a lot of information actually because we were in a specific area designated for like hand and arm movement																									
of the brain, of the direct in the primary motor cortex of the brain that controls the hand and arm,																									
and it's like the last part of the motor system that right before the signal gets sent down the spinal cord to the actual hand in the arm.																									
So it's actually like very rich information.																									
And even if you just have like five to ten neurons, you can actually decode with relatively high precision																									
the exact either location or velocity of the hand in space.																									
And that was, you know, so it's surprisingly how precise and rich the information,																									
even from a relatively low number of neurons.																									
And once you get more information and more neurons, you just, you don't need it.																									
The amount of encoding is quite impressive in the brain.																									
And yeah, I mean, if we want to kind of generalize this more, I think we've gotten a little bit too in-depth on these specific questions,																									
maybe, but maybe if anyone has other general questions or topics to discuss, yeah.																									
Yeah, just, Elon, when he first, when he first presented Neuralink,																									
they referenced this, an application that, you know, I think either was FDA approved or had gone through that process.																									
I'm starting to wonder whether he was referencing your work, or is there a number of...																									
No, no, he was talking about our project. He named it by name at the first presentation.																									
Elon Musk had done a few presentations, and the first time he actually talked about BrainGate and all that.																									
The second or third time, I think he started to degrade the description and start calling it like an archaic system, an ancient archaic system.																									
But I mean, in reality, it's literally, they're basically replicating exactly the experiment that we did.																									
And I think that was done on purpose because of the FDA.																									
In the FDA world, things are very slow, and they like to see proof, and they like to see precedent and things like that.																									
So I think they're probably modeling it after our system for that reason that we did a successful IGE.																									
This is awesome, because this is where I'd like to probably take the conversation a little bit,																									
but we were just talking about this earlier today on a group chat and how Neuralink is more of an innovation on a prior invention																									
and that he had referenced this thing earlier.																									
And then as soon as you started talking, I was like, could it be him? Could this be the original thing that he was referencing?																									
And so this is crazy that we have you're on stage.																									
																									
# Part 5																									
																									
I wasn't planning to, I didn't know that this room existed, and I've been having a really tiring week and day, so I'm a little tired also.																									
That's all good. No, this is exciting. It's exhilarating to have what is essentially a key person and the founding team of the thing that really...																									
I think from the perspective of an innovator, from the perspective of what Elon, I think it was the work you guys did and that the FDA component of it,																									
that you had advanced it so far along on the regulation side that caught his attention that this was a promising solution.																									
And so it's really incredible, you know, the kind of influence that you've had in what is potentially the future of computing and what you have here on stage.																									
You referenced the commercialization aspect of what he's doing.																									
Maybe you can touch on a little bit about, you know, has the prior work, has there been prior attempts to commercialize the history behind this?																									
And, you know, what is it that he's doing right as it relates to the commercialization of this stuff?																									
It'd be really curious. And then also just your timelines. You kind of touched on, you know, two to three years, maybe typing then auditory.																									
Seven to ten years, you said maybe, you know, that thing that Mika touched on, the working memory being edited or that sort of potential.																									
Could you maybe share some of that as well? A little more of your history around, you know, prior to Neuralink and what you think they're doing right in terms of commercialization and then your timelines.																									
Travis, can I add something? Well, can I may add something?																									
Yeah, go ahead.																									
So what I wanted to say is Abe is an amazing guest to have, but Neuralink builds on, I think, a hundred years of neuroscience.																									
Neuralink builds on not just Abe's work, but also, you know, the work on neural dust and optogenetics.																									
And I believe it represents a true successor to EEG and ECOG and DBS. There's tons more.																									
It's like, it is the next frontier of a hundred years of neuroscience.																									
Yeah, Abe's work is really a big part of that, but there's so much more.																									
And also, it's not my word. I was like an employee and I was just out of college at that company.																									
So I was, it was the Donnie Yuleb and Hockberg, Dr. Professor Hockberg and these other guys.																									
Michael, Misha Saruya was actually kind of like the star guy who did the, his PhD thesis was the monkey, the closed loop monkey,																									
intracortical monkey, you know, motor, like basically a neural prosthetic in monkeys.																									
They got, that was kind of like the major, the major milestone in around 2001, 2002.																									
And yeah, those guys kind of made it all happen. I kind of, I'm good at just getting things done.																									
So I kind of joined in. I was coming from a computer engineering background.																									
So, yeah, but that's, I'm glad you referenced that. Thank you, Mika.																									
Like you're part of that larger team and the larger movement that's been going on for some time.																									
So I'm glad you referenced that. I do love to hear your, you know, like, has there been other attempts to commercialize																									
and what are these guys doing right? And what do you think is going to happen in the next two, three years?																									
I mean, I think the big thing about Yuleb first of all, yeah, that's absolutely correct.																									
The one thing is that it is an intracortical decoding, you know, motor neural prosthetic device																									
that Braingate was one of the, you know, first systems of that type with populations of neurons being decoded in real time.																									
You know, EEG is just a little bit different technology as well as ECOG.																									
I mean, of course, all of neuroscience is necessary. And like it was just a massive field that goes back 100, 100, 200 years.																									
So, yeah, so I mean, I agree. It's all part of the same development there.																									
But as far as like the commercialization, I think it's important to note, yeah, like this is a huge, the neural link,																									
if they pull it off, which definitely hasn't happened yet, you know, like they have to have human, you know, subjects																									
and have people controlling the computers. I don't, I have no doubt that they're going to do it.																									
But if they, if they're able to do that, then I think it's hard to describe how big, I mean, it's kind of like similar to the scale																									
of like going to space, like creating a commercial space program, the first in human history, right?																									
Before that, it was either the U.S. government or the rest of the Soviet Union or China doing that.																									
And then it was like a commercial company sending satellites to space or going to the International Space Station																									
or sending a manned mission to Mars, which is probably going to happen also.																									
So it's like, I think it's along those lines, it's a pretty huge development because commercializing something of this type																									
and mass producing it, if they actually end up doing that, which is what they plan to do, it's, it's just, it's not an easy thing.																									
It's, technologically, it's not, it's not complicated, like this technology has existed.																									
We did 100%, in fact, it existed before 2003 or 2004 when we did it.																									
It was not new technology even then, it's a little bit complicated to take, you know, neuroscience technology,																									
electrical engineering technology, clinical neurosurgery types of things and put them together.																									
But it's not, none of those things were new.																									
And they're definitely not new now, but putting them together and making them commercial and using like a robotic implant																									
and mass producing it, that's, that's very new.																									
And I don't think anyone has ever done a neural, you know, a neural interface.																									
And I think the coolest part is going to be when they go into an augmentative type of approach,																									
going instead of just like helping someone with spinal cord injury or ALS to regain, you know, limb movement																									
or control a robotic arm or control a computer or an iPhone.																									
If they start going into augmentative, that's even a bigger thing.																									
But I guess to answer your question, I mean, there have been a lot of commercial projects.																									
Most of them are like on a much smaller scale.																									
I can't think of anything.																									
I mean, Micah, maybe you didn't know something, but like on this, on this scale, I mean, it's the one thing that for me in my,																									
I mean, this is not going to sound, it's going to sound like in a different realm.																									
But in my opinion, the most similar thing that's happening now is control lab CTRL labs,																									
which is an EMG decoding device that decodes hand motion.																									
And you just, it's a wearable EMG system.																									
And it was just acquired by Facebook for, I think, over $500 million.																									
And it's basically able to decode like you can type without a keyboard.																									
And you can even, when you get good at it, you can type without moving your fingers at all.																									
So it's basically a very high bandwidth interface.																									
And it's the guy who created it, his vision was like doing neural interfaces and neural technology.																									
So like neuroscience type technology, but why stop at like medical treatment?																									
Why, why, why, why do we put billions of dollars into like computer software and like iPhones and like VR?																									
But then, and we have all this neural interface technology, but we only do it for like treating a disease.																									
Like, why do we stop there? So his idea was, let's take that technology and then go towards increasing the bandwidth																									
between the human and the computer system.																									
And that's what they're doing with control labs.																									
In my opinion, that's the big thing is like augmentative systems.																									
And then there's a whole other realm, basically.																									
So I may be able to add something valuable here.																									
And that is that control labs, in terms of like the application of BrainGate,																									
in terms of giving people who can no longer move their limbs, control labs may be a very valuable tool in that specific context.																									
And it does make sense to compare control labs to Neuralink in only that respect in terms of controlling devices.																									
But, and I say that because the differences between what the machines are doing is vastly different.																									
As Abe knows, it's not news to Abe, but devices that might be more similar.																									
I mean, you can look up, and it won't be that useful for you to look up,																									
but you can look up Open Water by Mary Lou Jepsen.																									
Look for her talks on YouTube to read about what she's doing.																									
I'm sorry to watch her talks on YouTube to see her talk about what she's doing.																									
You can look up Furoxa, Microwave Imaging.																									
Unfortunately, there's not a lot for the average folks to read on that topic,																									
and I'll try to write something about it so that there's more stuff out there.																									
There's work, and you won't be able to find a whole lot of information about new work on combining deep learning with electrical impedance tomography.																									
They're seeing some huge medical imaging results there, especially for imaging the brain.																									
The idea that we can do, so MRIs are too slow, they measure blood flow, but they measure blood flow really slowly.																									
So the idea that we could speed that up with new faster chips to basically detect neurons firing																									
basically by reversing the refraction of light, which is called telegraphy,																									
and doing it fast enough so that we can notice the expansion and contraction of neurons as they're firing,																									
that would enable us to basically read things as fast as Neuralink is reading them,																									
as precisely as Neuralink is reading them, but in a non-invasive way,																									
and with ultrasound, we could stimulate the brain also non-invasively.																									
So this technology that Neuralink is doing potentially could be non-surgical and non-invasive in the future.																									
																									
# Part 6																									
																									
In that timeline, I don't know what it is, but that could also be a 15-year timeline.																									
The idea is that maybe you don't get brain surgery and you just sit in the wrong car and behind the headrest,																									
there's a device that will wirelessly take over your mind.																									
So that's another possibility in the future world.																									
But I want to break down also, from my lamest perspective, that there's vast differences in what Neuralink is																									
in terms of we talked about how many sensors and how many electrodes,																									
that maybe the first devices were talking like 3,000 electrodes,																									
and each hair is, I think, 16 electrodes, and then you have to have a whole bunch of hairs to get to 3,000,																									
and then potentially devices like 10,000 electrodes, and each electrode is potentially reading from several hundred neurons.																									
And when you have many of them in a string, you can do things like, you can basically create a really precise,																									
maybe 3D map, a spatial map of around the electrodes of what's firing and when.																									
This is like compared to the Utah rate, compared to DBS, compared to any sort of electrical reading done since																									
electrodes have been implanted in people and in animals for a very long time, over 100 years, I think,																									
that what you're getting is not only a massively greater amount of information,																									
a massively higher sampling rate, and you're getting big data.																									
You're getting data that might be more than your phone can handle.																									
Your phone may not be able to handle the, in fact, I don't think that your phone is going to be able to handle																									
the actual sampling rate of EEG currently, but this is vastly more.																									
This is way more than, I mean, so with this big data, doing things like BrainGate,																									
this is stuff that is way below the capability of Neuralink in the long term.																									
The real capability of Neuralink, I believe, is actually in decoding the signals that are passing between the microclusters																									
or neural columns or neural circuits and really, really beginning to decode what your thoughts are																									
and then beginning to manipulate your thoughts.																									
That's the bigger, longer term picture, as Abe said.																									
I don't expect this to happen in the first year or anything, and I don't know if the timeline is 15 years,																									
but I think this is real.																									
For people in the room, and Mika and Abe, I've got two follow-up questions for you here,																									
but for people in the room who are listening in, the topic is, of course, Neuralink and whether it's revolutionary																									
or potentially has tragical consequences, and there's been discussion on both,																									
but we're very fortunate to have some folks here.																									
Obviously, you are at the front line of some of this work and long before Neuralink showed up.																									
The two questions I had for you guys is, you referenced some of this prior work.																									
I'm curious about where are the geographical locations of this work.																									
Are you seeing, prior to Neuralink, and even now, I'm sure there's more companies spending time in the space,																									
are there certain cities, certain areas, and I'm curious for two reasons.																									
One, regulatory reasons, and I'm wondering whether certain countries have perhaps different moral,																									
philosophical differences that might be okay with certain types of research.																									
That's the first question, geographically speaking, where is all this research and work happening,																									
and then the second question I can do is follow-up.																									
Before we get into the answer, I just want to point out, Sanmoo is also very familiar with a lot of these topics in general,																									
and also Nick, Bergerf, and a couple other people, so I just want to make sure that they had a chance to share their thoughts,																									
because Mike and I have both been going babbling on for quite a while, and I thanks again for the help, for pointing it out.																									
Oh, that's great. Anyone of you guys, if you could just share some thoughts on geography, where is all this happening?																									
I mean, with computing, obviously the valley played a huge role to pushing things.																									
Is this predominantly in the valley as well, or is there other cities that are leading the church?																									
I'm not sure. Well, I can speak to just the basics of country-wise.																									
Most of this development is happening in the U.S.																									
A big, a cool company that comes to mind is NeuroPace.																									
They were quite one of the innovators for a long time doing epilepsy treatment.																									
They had closed-loop epilepsy treatment, or it's like Metronik had the implantable DBS.																									
There were several other companies that had, I mean, for me, it's important to differentiate between kind of reality and, you know,																									
where in reality, as far as treatment goes, not reality, but let's say clinical treatment or clinical implant of patients,																									
even in a clinical study or commercialization, is one area of something.																									
NeuroLink actually had a clinical trial, a successful clinical trial,																									
and then actually had a commercial product that they were implanting in patients in addition to Metronik with the DBS.																									
And I think that is significant, you know, because you can do a lot of stuff in the lab even, or just talk about it,																									
but that's not the same as having it done.																									
And then actually, to ask you a question about other geographical locations,																									
there's something called medical tourism, and basically you actually go to a different country to get medical treatments,																									
and it's cheaper, and that's usually the reason people do it, and you get very high-quality medical treatments for a lot less money,																									
and insurance companies even cover that nowadays, because it's even cheaper with the flights and the hotels than it would be due,																									
the same thing in the U.S. And there's other reasons to do medical tourism, which could in the future be like,																									
you go to like an island or something, or a place without a jurisdiction or just a country that has very lax laws,																									
and then on that topic, and you have a very high-quality system like NeuroLink or something, and you get it implanted there,																									
and there's not as many restrictions, and then you can get that for like an augmentative purpose or something like that.																									
I think in theory it's possible, because I think it's very likely that the FDA is just not going to open up like applications																									
for like augmentative types of things or treatments if you don't have a spinal cord injury or Parkinson's or ALS.																									
Can I ask you a few questions?																									
Oh, sorry, did I lie?																									
Oh, just five seconds. I don't think that French is also catching up with the U.S.																									
So, yeah.																									
Which country did I do? Which country did you say is better than us?																									
France.																									
France.																									
But there's also Brazil.																									
Nicolayla's in Brazil did a lot of cool work in Brazil, various times.																									
I had a quick question just to follow up regarding the geographic region.																									
I think Travis posed a really interesting thought.																									
There are some countries who have proven that they will use technology to control the population or limit the freedom of the population to some degree.																									
What do you think, based on some of the issues that were brought up by Mika and during this conversation,																									
was there any thought as to the threat against, not necessarily against other people,																									
but inside the country itself to utilize this technology as a sort of control method,																									
or like a hypothetical would be forced implants where your thoughts would be decoded.																									
And if you attended a meeting or viewed something that was considered forbidden speech,																									
it could be essentially prosecuted even though, because they have direct access to your thoughts in that regard.																									
Yeah, I just thought, I'm not sure how to really frame it,																									
but essentially the threat model regarding countries utilizing this technology in a really malicious way against their own citizens for control purpose.																									
This is someone who was speaking.																									
I just wanted to add on that and just to get back to the topic.																									
I think it is revolutionary that there's a huge commercial platform and it's such funding.																									
I think it's always difficult for researchers to actually get funding to do research.																									
And then we have done a lot of those already.																									
That's what you're all saying.																									
It's already been published, already been credited,																									
but I'm not sure how much credit are they giving to the scientists who actually wrote and did all the research in the last two decades or not.																									
And back on this Matt's point of view, the moment I was hearing about it,																									
I just think of a bunch of movies, Ghost in the Shell, Alina, The Battle Angel,																									
and a bunch of other things where they talk about not just patients, right?																									
They're just normal people who just want to extend their capability.																									
They want to have a robotic arm.																									
They want to actually store memory better away, like with that full chip.																									
																									
# Part 7																									
																									
Instead of you trying to think about it, actually have a memory chip to actually get the exact photo of your mind and show it to someone else.																									
But when you think about it, anyone who have a higher power into the computing system or the control center may be able to hack that system that you're actually using																									
and then actually control your mind or control your hand.																									
So I always worry about this wireless or Bluetooth type of this hardware that people can track you.																									
People can spy on you. People can actually take over decisions for you.																									
I mean, we already chip our pads and then we know exactly where the pad is, even though it may be lost.																									
And, you know, I think we're going a direction where there will be a whole lot of new communities, new laws, regulations,																									
maybe as Abe and some others were saying that it may be so difficult within U.S.																									
It may not be the case in some other countries. I know some countries in Africa who use Chinese telecom services,																									
they already have the capability to track you down and share your information online.																									
So the political party can exactly track that person down and persecute you or prison you.																									
And they actually have tracking system on all their population.																									
So it's already been happening on domains that we are using right now. And I'm sure more we make,																									
more things that can be controlled than more things that can be hacked.																									
We're going to have somebody chime in a little bit.																									
Go ahead. Go ahead.																									
This is Manuel. Thanks.																									
So one thing, I just bring some clarity on the idea of decoding brain signals.																									
I think it's really important to use words so that people who are laymen can actually understand what is going on																									
when we're talking about brain computer interfaces.																									
And the idea of decoding brain signals, I think is a little bit disingenuous																									
because we're still really at the capacity of really kind of like a super polygraph																									
in that you can map a baseline and you can get a control that's related to some idea.																									
And then you can have the computer compare, do the pattern recognition and apply control to that.																									
That is not decoding brain signals of someone in trying to identify what their thinking is.																									
That is far from that.																									
In fact, that leap is a near miracle if it is to ever happen.																									
But for now...																									
That's a straw man.																									
How is that a straw man?																									
I'm literally talking about what is happening when you map neural activity and you store it																									
and you use a machine recognition system to compare what is happening in real time																									
and you're making a guess.																									
That is not decoding brain signals and identifying the content of someone's thoughts.																									
Your statement is true, but it's a straw man because you're talking about what we've done in the past																									
not what we're going to do with this new technology, which is what I'm talking about.																									
Okay, great. So you have high hopes for it and that's great.																									
I hope those really come through.																									
So the reason why what I'm saying is true is because the research...																									
So I'm currently writing a book about all the research that has been done																									
that we're going to use to apply to decoding thoughts with this technology.																									
Optogenetics, yes. You're going to use optogenetics to, I guess, do it in some point.																									
And I'm looking forward to it. I'm very excited for it.																									
In the meantime, though, if I could just add real quick,																									
I think when we talk about decoding the signals, there's different levels of signals that you can decode, right?																									
If you're decoding an EEG activity, sure, you're going to get sort of broad scale different regions																									
and picking up their activity, but if you're talking about sort of like a multiplex array type system,																									
you're going to be picking up the actual individual neurons within that region that you're sampling from.																									
And so when you start to decode that, you have multiple different probes that are picking up a number of different neurons.																									
And sometimes the probes, an individual probe is going to collect activity from three, four, five, six neurons that are around it.																									
And so you have to be able to take the signals and you have to be able to sort all of those different signals																									
in order to decode what activity is coming from an individual neuron versus what is coming from a number of different neurons.																									
And so there's different techniques that you can employ in order to literally, I guess, decode the signals that are coming in																									
to figure out how many neurons that you're recording from and where are they in relation to the other ones.																									
So some clarity around the term decode.																									
If I look up to a stop sign and I read STOP, I've decoded the symbols, right?																									
But I've decoded the symbols based on an stored eligibility to identify those symbols and to read a word, right?																									
But if I'm not an English speaker and I've never been taught English and I walk up to it and I somehow decode that is said STOP,																									
that is the magical gate that you're trying to cross and that's not been proven nearly, not even remotely.																									
Well, I think what you might be talking about is associating the activity with an action or with a thought.																									
I'm trying to get clarity around the term decode being brain signals and I'm saying that to map into stores of interpretation																									
and to read into pattern recognize it is not decoding in the sense of putting something in somebody's head and reading their thoughts.																									
Nick, I'd love to hear your thoughts. I just wanted to say manuals point, and this is a bit of the curse of knowledge,																									
but for anyone who's hearing this discussion and is relatively new to these concepts, I think manual raises a decent nuanced point,																									
which is this, that if you're walking away thinking that a neural link or this technology currently has with the monkey video example,																									
it's not reading the monkey's purest thoughts in terms of what it wants to do, it's inferring it by training a neural net																									
that every time these particular brain patterns are occurring in this part of the region,																									
the monkey seems to want to move the joystick in a certain direction, and it's predicting or inferring intent, I guess,																									
and that's not the same as the monkey's actual thought of I want to move this thing, I guess.																									
That's a useful nuanced point for anyone listening.																									
It's a really important point because the ultimate goal, like I think Abe suggested, of getting to the point of being able to actually do augmentation,																									
or as we call it, intelligence amplification, does not require one to be in the brain. That's the point that I was trying to make.																									
I have a question. What do you think is the real decoding?																									
Real decoding would mean that you walk into a room and somebody has some sort of EEG sensor placed on your head,																									
and whatever your thinking starts essentially just going into some interpreter that says what you're thinking.																									
And that's impossible. It's important because the reason why it has to be made clear that that's impossible is because behavioral biometric data																									
is not just about my privacy in the sense that, oh yeah, it was my thoughts or it was my email,																									
or it was my behavioral biometric data is your nervous system and activity in real time.																									
Now, if some company or whatever government figures out how to straight decode behavioral biometrics,																									
everything that enroll data, all signals that come from your nervous system are behavioral biometric,																									
whether you want to call them EEG or you want to call it heart rate, you want to call it just freaking facial recognition, whatever,																									
is behavioral biometric. But to be able to suddenly, without the reference, decode behavioral biometrics,																									
and then use it is the ultimate control of humanity, is the ultimate. There's nothing beyond that.																									
If I can ask a question regarding your focus on decoding, I think my statement when I was asking about whether or not																									
a country or entity could point this technology in a malicious way at an individual or a group of individuals,																									
I think it's not whether or not it can be decoded in real time and controlled or sort of bi-directional single amplification																									
like you mentioned, but more so to the point of analyzing. And I think just sort of like the precedence on this																									
is that Black Mirror episode, I think most of us have probably seen it if I could presupposition,																									
but it's where the patterns could be analyzed because I think you make it really strongly about the future uses of this																									
and there is one hypothetical where if we're talking about analyzing and recording short-term memory																									
and all of these neurons and activity going on in the brain, and if we were to record that like we saw in that Black Mirror episode,																									
that's sort of where my head was at when I was asking the question about hypothetical, let's say without proper constraints																									
or ethical guidelines like we would see maybe in the West. Is there sort of like this idea that or threat that we should be precedent?																									
Here's the good news. The good news is, just quickly if I can respond to him, the good news is we're not able to decode brain signals.																									
And if we were, it would be extremely dangerous, but here's the bad news. We can do the stuff that you're imagining																									
without decoding brain signals. We could do it with basic behavioral biometrics, whether you're typing on the computer,																									
whether you're essentially taking, whether I'm taking two or three shots of your face in 10-minute intervals from your camera phone,																									
whether your activity on through the accelerometer, and the Lord, God, help me. You give me your heart rate.																									
I used to work for the State Department doing psyopsis in Afghanistan 12 years ago, and I figured out back then that I could do,																									
I could map your neurodynamics based on your heart rate, and that's before you even get into the content of your psyche.																									
So, I mean, it was possible today. It's sublime.																									
																									
# Part 8																									
																									
I think, though, just that analysis that you just determined, right, like the telemetry and all these other biometric indicators,																									
that's interesting to a point, but you're still running on an assumption basis, which is you're assuming that these various data points																									
are correlating to a hypothesis that you...																									
Well, that's the thing. That's like I just said. Again, if you're looking at it in terms of me trying to identify																									
what the content of your psyche is, you're missing the point. I can make better inference based on your neurocognitive dynamics																									
to decide what decisions you're going to make. I don't necessarily care for the content of your psyche.																									
Did you have a comment in between this? Because I had one more addition to that after.																									
Yeah, I basically think the same thing as some... Well, many of you, you kind of just like answered yourself.																									
Essentially, you're asking a question of like, is correlation equals to causation, right?																									
But then how much does it matter, right? Let's say if you're an engineer...																									
It only matters if you're a neuroscientist, like, oh, I want to know if the signal is the cause of this behavior.																									
But it doesn't really matter if you're trying to make a commercial product or if you're an engineer.																									
As long as you have a working model that can have a high accuracy in predicting something, like...																									
Yeah, I don't see... Yeah, I've had...																									
Yeah, they're at a very high accuracy right now, as what I'm saying. They're at a very high accuracy right now.																									
And what we can do first and foremost is actually bring some clarity to the difference between behavior barometric data																									
in real time because that has to do with literally knowing your cognitive dynamics in real time.																									
And if we just throw that data in with your pictures on Facebook,																									
the advantage is the difference between a mosquito bite infringement on your privacy																									
and an elephant trampling on your cognitive and your cognition in real time.																									
I think that manual is hitting on a really important point here, and it's just touching on something that I was trying to explain earlier,																									
which is we keep talking about the ethics of this stuff and then the cognitive and the decoding,																									
and it's so important to address what is the big difference of actually having an intracortical or an implantable electrode system																									
or decoding actual neural signals and all that because we have...																									
So the neural signals are mapped into physical reality through the body and language and things like that.																									
So we already have the ability to map facial expressions, your habits, what you write...																									
Google is analyzing everything you write in all your emails, all your searches.																									
Facebook is doing the same thing and then they're analyzing for your advertising type of profile																									
and then they're selling it to advertisers.																									
So I think it's so important to get into...																									
When you start getting access to neural data, what is that changing in the picture?																									
Because you can't even talk about that if you don't understand.																									
It's like manually bringing in what the current picture actually is,																									
which I think most people here probably don't even understand the level...																									
And I don't know if this is sensitive territory here or something,																									
but when someone's watching you, you can learn a lot about someone just by looking at their habits.																									
More than you can fathom.																									
More than most people can fathom.																									
Yes, you can learn so much more in the book.																									
That's what I'm saying is that the neural brain is already mapped to the outside world.																									
That's your body and it's your voice and what you see is the input and what you hear.																									
This is all available because you don't need a brain-computer interface to do that.																									
The interface is the sense organs and the motor control.																									
I think that's such a key point and it's kind of related also to this whole ethical thing.																									
Everyone talks about what are the ethics of what we can access and all that,																									
but why don't we also talk about the ethics of what's actually currently happening,																									
which is breaking ethical and privacy guidelines.																									
So those are just some interesting questions.																									
Can I say something about...																									
For those people listening, if I can try to sum it in layman's terms,																									
you guys are saying that the vast majority of the things that potentially could be the equivalent of those...																									
What's that, Matt? What's that?																									
What's the name of the Black Mirror episode where things get really, really out of hand?																									
Those things could occur long before we can actually read thoughts.																									
In fact, many of those things in terms of applications happening through smartphones																									
and will continue to inch away.																									
So we could begin those debates and separate that from the very specific advancement of Neuralink.																									
Is that a fair summary of that?																									
I think that's a good point.																									
What I want to say is a couple things.																									
One is that you can look this up on Wikipedia.																									
It's called Effective Computing.																									
It's basically the idea of using multiple sensor modalities																									
or just basically analyzing user behavior and their behavior on a computer																									
and making predictions about the user.																									
That could be how the user feels or what their intentions are.																									
This is a kind of decoding.																									
Really, what I want to talk about is decoding for a second.																									
When it comes to the Utah Array or to the Neuralink device that we've seen...																									
I'm sorry, I meant BrainGate or the monkey in the Neuralink video																									
that is recreating the BrainGate where we're decoding the monkey's intention based upon																									
reading neural patterns to the intention of where the monkey wants to move the cursor.																									
Let's call that a certain resolution of decoding that you can get with BrainGate.																									
When you increase the resolution and the sampling rate and the amount of data																									
that you can collect from the brain so that basically what you can recode																									
or reconstruct from that data is a vastly higher resolution.																									
It's like going from not only knowing what the monkey's intention is																									
but knowing of where it wants to move the cursor																									
but knowing very precisely where it wants to move the cursor.																									
Maybe knowing a little bit more about what the monkey intends.																									
Now when the monkey is...																									
Maybe the computer is doing eye tracking on the monkey																									
and there's a bunch of things in the environment																									
and the monkey is seeing a banana.																									
There's some neural activity that Neuralink is picking up																									
when the monkey thinks about a banana.																									
The monkey is still doing the cursor thing.																									
Neuralink is predicting where the cursor needs to go very accurately																									
faster than the monkey can move the cursor when it was using the joystick.																									
The Neuralink is noticing when the monkey wants a banana or an apple or a grape.																									
This is high resolution decoding.																									
The thing is with Neuralink is such a huge leap forward																									
in the resolution and capability that what higher resolution decoding is like...																									
This is when we can begin to...																									
We know that the monkey is thinking about a banana																									
and we know the cursor is over there																									
and maybe you put this in a human being																									
and maybe we know what word a person is thinking about																									
or which picture a person is thinking about.																									
So the resolution of decoding matters a lot																									
and that's why this is different.																									
																									
# Part 9																									
																									
Michael, this is a very good point.																									
Go ahead, Manila.																									
The resolution between a regular EEG device																									
and Neuralink is astronomical.																									
Nobody is debating that.																									
It's insane.																									
But it's still in the motor cortex																									
and the motor cortex obviously is extremely favorable																									
to mapping so that works perfectly for people who have...																									
I don't know, people who are disabled																									
and would like a way to interface with their computer																									
if they don't have the voice or tactile or something like that.																									
So nobody is questioning the value there.																									
I'm just trying to bring some clarity around what it means to read your mind.																									
What we're saying is if what you want to arrive at is intelligence amplification																									
it turns out you don't need to be in the brain at all																									
because there's more than enough information in real time																									
especially if you have a wearable device on the right																									
and essentially look at your face and intermittent times																									
to give you the opportunity to cultivate that closed loop potential																									
and improve your neurocognitive dynamics																									
and with that your decision making and exploration capabilities																									
and learning curve that is possible today.																									
So not disagreeing with you there in that terms of effective computing																									
which is a way to describe what you just said																									
is a way to...																									
What we can do with EEG and eye tracking																									
the limits of those technologies alone, just those two																									
hasn't come close to what is their potential possibility																									
with just those two technologies.																									
So there's far more.																									
But to the topic of the room, what Neuralink offers																									
is for the two main points I think about																									
is this is not a technology we can stop from happening																									
and two, next level decoding of thoughts is very, very likely																									
and I apologize to people who don't want to hear that																									
but...																									
No, no.																									
And I think just I want to definitely...																									
There's a few folks who haven't chimed in yet																									
I definitely wanted to get their opinions as well																									
but I have a larger question for you guys here																									
there's a lot of technical experience in the room																									
I'm going to use an analogy to help sort of frame the question																									
so when we look at Tesla, we know where the breakthroughs are																									
it's essentially obviously the battery manufacturing capabilities																									
the ability to, you know, autonomous driving is next in the horizon																									
like you can start listing out the core breakthroughs																									
when it comes to Neuralink, like what are the...																									
You guys are touching on it but I'd love to hear thematically																									
what are these core pillars that they're advancing																									
that maybe they built on the prior work																									
but these guys have taken it to a necessary step to commercialize																									
the wires and the precision around surgical implantation																									
the resolution.																									
If you guys can just comment on some of those core architectural pillars																									
that make Neuralink particularly a revolution																									
I'd love to hear people's thoughts																									
and, you know, yeah, so go ahead.																									
I would say the scale, you know, the scalability of the product																									
because I think most of the technology, like has been mentioned by Micah																									
most reputable neuroscience departments will say in academia																									
have most of the tool sets that are available that Neuralink is using																									
it's nothing, you know, monumental by any means																									
in terms of what they're actually recording and doing in the brain																									
but to be able to scale that is no small feat																									
and that's what is very, very impressive																									
but not only that but kind of, and Micah touched on it earlier too																									
which I never really thought about																									
but it's really an interesting idea is that the ability to handle that much data																									
in some sort of smaller package that can be utilized across, you know,																									
thousands or millions of users because even as it is right now																									
even if you stick one probe into the brain																									
to record, let's say, 300 or 500 neurons individually																									
it's not a fast process to analyze all that data																									
and you need a certain amount of computing power																									
that most residential folk do not have at their hands																									
so it'll be interesting to see how they'll be able to sort of scale down																									
the computing power that's necessary in order to handle that much information																									
that's coming in because I think you guys were talking about decoding																									
I think there's a number of different levels of decoding																									
and so, you know, when we talk about it, first you need to take the signal																									
that's coming from the brain itself																									
and you need to figure out what's contributing to that signal																									
which neurons are firing and how are they firing																									
and then on top of that now you need to decode the activity																									
that is, you know, responsible for creating that signal																									
which is more, you know, putting it to an action or a personality																									
and then you need to map it into the person themselves																									
for inter-individual differences																									
so I think the ability for scale																									
and which is why it is very cool with Neuralink being, you know,																									
very much with Elon Musk and the Tesla group																									
I think the capabilities of them to scale that is definitely in good hands																									
but that would be what I would think is the most revolutionary thing about it																									
So could you, so maybe you or if someone can elaborate on the scale piece																									
am I hearing this correctly?																									
So every aspect of what they're doing, even the choice of materials																									
like has been used in labs that have been essentially working in this specific domain																									
or are they pulling things from, I don't know, the semiconductor or other industries																									
that historically are more needed for the scale aspect of it																									
but are they bringing in other domains that traditionally were not mixed,																									
brought into the mix to achieve scale or other technologies, other applications																									
I'll give you an example, like for battery manufacturing, you know, Tesla had looked																									
to bottle manufacturing and adopted some of these practices to help, you know,																									
increase the production capacity and reduce its cost and achieve economies of scale																									
so I'm just curious, like, what are some of these things that these guys are doing to achieve scale?																									
Is that stuff, you know, any technical advancements there that they're pulling from other places?																									
I had actually two questions, one of which I have to stress this point																									
so they're sort of related, so I'm going to put forth, again, I should probably mention																									
not a bioperson, I deal with physics, so very far from this																									
but there are two things that should be noted.																									
The first is, I think I looked at Micah's point of, you know, how much resolution are we getting																									
but there is a very different ethical dilemma based upon how fungible a learned model is,																									
how replaceable the human is, that is, if I train a model on, say, Micah																									
and how he conducts motor activities, how does that model transfer to another person, right?																									
And based on that, you have different degrees of privacy concerns and ethical concerns.																									
Now, that's a very interesting notion and I'd be very curious just to understand																									
how similarly different brains interact, I think that is scientific goal in and of itself																									
and it's also ethically really concerning because it means, you could say, train a model																									
then force your device upon a prisoner or a war or something																									
and use them to interrogate out the entire view of the enemy's military formations																									
using an implantable device, that's pretty scary.																									
Now, what I was thinking about that, I was thinking about learning																									
and I was realizing, let's say you have a model which you've learned, right?																									
Now, conventionally, what you guys probably do and you know this better than I do																									
is you wait systems so that your output matrix can be reduced																									
and you have a sensible result.																									
But you have a system which is a very simple model.																									
Say I turn on a light to on, price and off once or it's 1110 or 1110 or anything like this,																									
you have like a finite state machine and it's very simple in electrical engineering																									
to come up with a circuit which will look at a system which goes through a finite state sequence																									
and directly code that to give and result.																									
Now, you could either go through a lot of transistors to make do with this in a very abstract system,																									
say an x86 system, or you can just come up with an FPGA that's a field programmable gate array																									
or an ASIC and use custom digital logic which is trained to recognize a certain sequence																									
and use that for processing.																									
So what I'm saying is, say you had a reprogrammable ASIC or an FPGA in every person,																									
all of a sudden the scale goes down to such a degree																									
and there's so much parallelization because of the way it operates																									
that I do think that becomes entirely tenable to handle this on a very, very large scale.																									
I think that's a really interesting point.																									
Regarding scalability though, because we're really hypothesizing about future technologies																									
and if we apply Moore's law to all of this as well, there is the application that																									
or the inference that we can make that scalability for processing																									
and increased processing power will go down in size																									
or we'll find some new revolutionary method for handling all of this.																									
I do think though, on this note about talking about scalability																									
and all this large scale data processing,																									
for everyone in the room, a general question I want to throw out,																									
is what are the implications of being able to analyze the big data coming from everyone's brain?																									
What kind of like, what would that mean for like,																									
manual made some really good points about the bio indicators																									
and how much inference you can get out of those just by itself.																									
Those are generally available right now.																									
What happens when we actually can scale and find those key indicators																									
right from the human brain?																									
What does that mean when extrapolated and analyzed across like million plus population sizes?																									
And the point is you definitely don't need anybody worried about a brain																									
and having a population of cyborgs to get super rationality																									
because you can do it with the existing technology.																									
The question is, are you going to create laws that protect individual behavior																									
by metrics to make it even feasible in the first place?																									
But it would be an extreme advantage, yes, to arrive at super rationality.																									
I have a, my retort to that would be,																									
laws are not a clear indicator of prevention.																									
They're not, they're a reaction more than anything.																									
Laws are about creating design spaces.																									
Right now, everyone in technology who works with machine prediction																									
is designing in the approach of artificial intelligence,																									
which means that you're trying to create a standalone complex																									
that will be able to read humanity and be a benevolent shepherd to it.																									
That's one approach.																									
Another approach is intelligence amplification.																									
You're using the same resource that resources called machine prediction,																									
but you're doing it in a different approach.																									
You're allowing the individual to optimize their cognitive dynamics																									
and their learning potential.																									
But you cannot do that until you can essentially create a line																									
that separates the data necessary to do the one versus the other.																									
If you, if you have no line,																									
then everybody's approaching it from the standpoint of artificial intelligence																									
and everybody's using all the data and however they see fit																									
and you have a land of confusion.																									
Now to Kev's point that you were,																									
and it goes right along the line with your question about																									
what do you gain from this kind of thing																									
is the question of the empathy gap.																									
If you create a universal model of the human mind,																									
whether that model is, it might be universal in terms of how you gathered data																									
and essentially modeled it, but you still will have an empathy gap																									
that it will not relate in any way to the mind of an individual walking down the street.																									
And if you assume and say, well, based on the science																									
of my having collected 10 billion parameters																									
and created this model that is right, then you're now in the land of tyranny.																									
That's a really interesting point.																									
That's what I was actually kind of wondering with it.																									
And I think you summarized it.																									
The empathy gap is what it's called.																									
But that's interesting because I was wondering regarding how the individual neuro-inspiring																									
in one person's brain, if they would be almost identical																									
in another individual's brain based on, you know,																									
everyone's individual neuroplasticity and everything.																									
																									
# Part 10																									
																									
But that's a really interesting point.																									
I just wanted to make a point which is sort of on a different aspect																									
of the neurolinx impact on us and vice versa.																									
How is the human mind going to cope with something being implanted into it,																									
which is neither the self nor the imagination?																									
What keeps us from going down this like weird schizophrenic out of touch with reality thing																									
once some things exist within our own minds which don't pertain to the self,																									
don't pertain to ourselves?																									
What will be the impact on our own psyche is my question.																									
And if there's any neuroscientists or psychologists in here																									
who can tell me if the brain will cope with hearing voices,																									
all of us from this neurolinx thing.																									
Don't we already have something like that with, like,																									
how do you differentiate between a neural interface																									
that allows you to, like, control a computer and, like, a keyboard																									
and a computer that, like, you know, having access to social media																									
or all kinds of stuff like that?																									
I think the difference for me is that the sensory input																									
and sort of action output, it's clear here.																									
These are tools like our eyes, mouths, hands.																									
These are tools that we've evolved with for thousands, millions.																									
God knows how long.																									
So when something like this gets implanted into the mind and body out of nowhere,																									
how are we going to be able to handle that?																									
So I think Nika is raising a point as in we already have the sensory modalities,																									
five modalities to that same.																									
But having this implant will be our sixth modality																									
that has not been part of our evolution or development																									
that's suddenly implanted.																									
How is our brain, or mind, or our consciousness going to cope with																									
interacting with such external, I guess, external hardware																									
that's in our brain?																									
And just thinking about that, I think for people who require such equipment,																									
let's say in the medical community, people will be more inclined to use it.																									
But for people who just want to enhance their capabilities,																									
I think that's where people are going to be murky about whether they choose to do it or not.																									
But for the medical community, I think it will be a huge push and advancement.																									
Also, Nicky, can you elaborate?																									
Because like, well, sorry, I just, I worked on a project called BrainGate.																									
That was a motor interface that we actually did, an implantable motor,																									
like enabling people to control computers and robotic arms with thought.																									
That's pretty much just like they couldn't move their arm																									
so they could think about moving their hand or arm																									
and then the computer will actually do what they want.																									
And I was wondering if you can, I think what you're trying to say is like,																									
in the case where you have an auditory prosthesis																									
that you're getting sound into your brain without the traditional sensory organ like the ear,																									
I think that's what you're saying.																									
I'm just not 100% clear like, you know, what you're getting at with regards to a neural interface.																									
Because like a neural interface does not necessarily imply that things are, you know,																									
working completely differently from the current system.																									
For example, if you don't have an arm and you get a neural interface																									
that decodes the hand and arm movement and then you get a prosthetic arm connected to your body																									
and you're controlling the prosthetic arm.																									
I mean, that's not, that's not different from having an arm in most regards.																									
It's just a replacement arm.																									
Or if you have an auditory prosthesis or you can like, let's say a cochlear implant																									
or a more neural interface auditory prosthesis.																									
So you have a microphone and then you put the sound into your brain.																									
That's not any different.																									
So I just curious, can you elaborate on what you're getting at?																									
Sunwoo actually did a pretty good reiteration of my point here.																									
It's the whole concept of having another sense added to us.																									
In the case of like having a robotic arm be controlled directly by the brain,																									
I can see why there's a bit more sort of transference with the skills our brain and body already has																									
for things like moving arms.																									
My anxieties are more directed towards what would it be like to have a Google bar implanted directly into our mind?																									
I can answer that with a real example.																									
So there's a neuroscientist, his name is David Eagleman.																									
He was Texas-based San Francisco Bay Area based now.																									
He's written a bunch of books.																									
I recommend that you check out his books.																									
And one of the things that he talks about are basically alternative kinds of neural interfaces that implant information into your brain.																									
For example, there have been tongue strips that have electrodes on the tongue and they're connected to a camera.																									
And you give this to someone who's blind and they can begin to make out an image from the electrodes on their tongue that are coming from the camera.																									
So it's like imagine that every pixel in the camera, which represents the image that's being captured,																									
is causing a corresponding electrical stimulation on a flat grid that stimulates their tongue.																									
And the person is able to see basically a crude picture of reality via that stimulation.																									
So the image from the camera is going into their brain because their tongue is being stimulated.																									
This same thing has also been done with a back strip of electrodes, a really large back strip where people were able to see through their back.																									
So the camera was plugged into, you know, the pixels on the camera corresponded to stimulation on their back and their brain turned that into an image.																									
So that's an example of how you can plug in data into the brain.																									
And so David Eagleman further goes on to talk about how you could do that with stock data.																									
You could send stock data directly into someone's brain with a similar idea.																									
Now if we bypass the tongue in the back and then we just, you know, basically directly stimulate neurons,																									
then the idea is like, okay, so if we can, by watching a person eat broccoli enough times,																									
and watching many people eat broccoli enough times, watching their neurons and watching in just the right places.																									
So we notice just the right, just the right temple and spatial patterns in neural activity that correspond to broccoli most of the time.																									
Then the idea here is that if we could then recreate those patterns through brain stimulation,																									
if we could recreate the temple and spatial patterns by stimulating neurons that we saw,																									
the temple and spatial patterns that we saw in medical imaging that corresponded with broccoli,																									
if we could recreate them inside someone's neurons, then that person might perceive broccoli where there is none.																									
So there are experiments in which you can give someone special brain stimulation																									
and they, I think, it's transcranial magnetic stimulation and they might see like a light.																									
There's examples of, you know, I guess, I mean, you know, there are many examples of altered brain activity																									
where someone takes some sort of medication and they see things that are not really there,																									
or they see patterns that are not really there, hallucinogenic medication, for example.																									
And there's also examples of, you know, people who hear things are not really there.																									
And, you know, I guess schizophrenia is a topic that we don't really want to go into,																									
but you can sort of like consider how do those people deal with it.																									
And in that particular instance, schizophrenia is very devastating.																									
And like I said, we don't really want to go to that topic because it's kind of sad.																									
But yeah, so these are, check out David Eagleman's work.																									
And that may really be an area of your interest.																									
Thank you, Mika. Sorry.																									
I just wanted to also ask if, do you know if David Eagleman conducted these experiments with conducting, sorry,																									
putting these, how do you call it, putting the input directly to the mind through the tongue or the back or whatever																									
of images in the mind rendering these images and actually seeing it.																									
Would it work with people who are born blind or are these people who are just, they had their eyes covered,																									
they weren't blind, what's the deal with that?																									
But at the same time, the schizophrenia aspect, I'm hesitant because you can't always tell ahead of time																									
and I'm nervous if they start putting these implants into people who are predisposed or anything like that.																									
It could be an entire disaster, but that's too cynical.																									
Agreed. Yeah, the potential for mistakes are big.																									
I just forgot. What was the previous question?																									
As to David Eagleman's studies, do you know if the people who are being tested on, did they always have vision?																									
Did they lose their vision? Were they born blind?																									
Okay, so I can answer this question in a general way.																									
You probably want to look up David Eagleman's studies for a specific answer,																									
but the general question is that, so what happened is there have been experiments on rats where they've taken an eyeball out of a rat's eye socket																									
and they've plugged it into the part of the brain that is called the, considered to be the audio cortex																									
and the audio cortex of the brain, which is supposed to be for processing your ears, learned to see.																									
So the idea here is that the neocortex is a general learning algorithm.																									
You can plug in any sensor into any place.																									
What the fuck?																									
Yeah, because the reason is because basically it's as if the neocortex has the same sort of way of functioning no matter what it's functioning.																									
It's like you plug in any sense and it can process any sensation.																									
It's like a general learning algorithm.																									
To add to Nicky's point about people who are born blind, because I did some work on people who are not born blind,																									
but became blind after lesion or surgery or accidents in their primary visual cortex,																									
but I think you'll be interested to know the work of Ahmedi from Israel, I think he's a Weissman Institute or maybe Tel Aviv.																									
But he works with people who are consented blind.																									
They're born blind.																									
But how do they actually learn to navigate through space and see is what he does is that he actually trains these patients or blind people																									
to use cameras that actually read out your area and then send very specific sound, timbre, pitch, tone, what not.																									
So you would associate different type of patterns of sound through space, color, depth and objects.																									
And more recently, he's been shown that these patients can actually differentiate between color of red, green and blue,																									
or like if this is sprite, this is coke, things like that and they could literally have these blind patients who are successful in learning easy over two to three years,																									
can actually walk through maze.																									
And if you actually run fMRI and other type of brain imaging data and brain imaging techniques on these patients,																									
they've never had any visual input through their visual system.																									
So technically, their primary visual cortex would be just not working, assumed.																									
But when they actually learned to navigate the visual world using sound as an association,																									
he actually saw a representation of space in primary visual cortex, but their input was auditory system, right?																									
So our understanding that this specific brain areas are very localized and specific may not be so true that certain areas we call visual area																									
are not just visual area, there are other audio-visual, multi-sensory integrated neurons																									
and populations that actually interact with one another.																									
So I highly recommend you read into our medis for if you are very interested.																									
And some people like Project Prikash by Power Sinha from MIT, he worked with patients or actually population in India																									
who easily after cataract surgery can gain vision.																									
But they are so, you know, in such remote part of the world, they don't even know about the surgery.																									
So when they're born, they literally have no vision.																									
So he takes all these doctors to FGA's perform the cataract surgery.																									
And suddenly after nine years, you gain this rich information or feature about the world.																									
And these people not having access to vision in their critical period are now suddenly having all this information coming through their eye.																									
So of course, there is some transition that happens individual development that they have problem with occlusions																									
and detecting certain borderlines and whatnot.																									
But with enough treatment, these patients or these children can actually gain as normal side as a person who is actually not born with such eye problems.																									
So I think there are enough interesting research going on right now and people who are born blind																									
or could be, you know, normal but did not have a surgery.																									
I also wanted to, like, I think I'm starting to understand the concept of, like,																									
if you just start getting access to tons of data and information and, you know,																									
I think a lot about Yosha Bach's description of consciousness and, like, you know,																									
like, what if you can just, your BCI is, like, accessing and helping you control your own attention or, like, direct access to memories																									
and, like, filing through the memories and filing direct information or cognitive stuff.																									
I think that's a really interesting question and I, it's kind of like, what happens?																									
Like, is it possible?																									
I do agree.																									
And then what happens in that situation?																									
Like, does your brain just, like, spark to life with, like, this new, dimensional types of abilities?																									
And I, there's another area that's related to this that I'm interested in.																									
It's hard to describe it, but it's basically looking into almost consciousness but, like, psychic phenomena and things like that.																									
That would, where you're talking about schizophrenia or psychosis, that definitely would be a negative issue.																									
Like, but there are other, there are other things that are in, like, altered state of consciousness.																									
Like, we already, people do, like, LSD or psychotrophics and things like that and access to different areas.																									
What if the BCI or neurotechnology can actually either go in a complementary way to using psychotrophics or doing similar capabilities with technology?																									
I think that's a future area of neural interfaces that is also, I think, interesting or possibly related.																									
So, I actually found that very interesting because I have a similar question for you.																									
So, let's consider a state space, right?																									
So, say you have, so this is, I'm going to use maths terminology.																									
Please, some of the CSP people over here break it out into the language you guys actually use.																									
So, say you have a real number, right? Any real has a cardinality.																									
The space of reals has a cardinality to continue.																									
Now, say you have R2 or R3 or R exponent n where n is a natural number.																									
All of these will still have the cardinality of the reals that is the continuum.																									
And if I wanted to, say, map all of, say, R2 or R2, you know, R1,																									
I can essentially, using a modular system, map all of R2 or R1																									
because I can split it into two parts based on congruences.																									
There is essentially a linear tradeoff between how many different states I have																									
and how accurate, you know, I have to be if I have a single finite double as a variable type.																									
So my question is, is there also a linear drop-off between how many nerves am I looking at																									
and when they're firing? Like, if, say, a nerve is on or off at a certain time,																									
is there a linear tradeoff and accuracy to the number of nerves you have for the same state space?																									
And secondly, if, as Maitha says, these are all spatiotemporal signals,																									
does that not mean that when you send them in,																									
every input has to have a certain time signature? That is, say, I have a spatiotemporal reaction alpha,																									
which corresponds to me tasting a banana. Does that mean for you to induce the taste of a banana in a subject?																									
You need to be stimulating for a time period alpha.																									
So essentially, we are limited by how much time each sub-task takes to process.																									
Or is there, say, a harmonic system to these spatiotemporal setups,																									
where we can speed these up by an integer multiple or something?																									
																									
# Part 11																									
																									
And of course, the obvious workaround I see over here is, we don't send in a reed pulse,																									
which is, this is what a banana tastes like.																									
We can try to send in a right pulse, which is, this is my body's reaction after I've tasted the banana.																									
And I'm trying to understand how these things play in terms of complexity and getting around this time limitation.																									
I think if there's like a neuroscientist who can explain some of the neuro, the fundamental, like the systems neuroscience,																									
I feel like you're asking math type questions, but I'm not sure how they go directly into like, you know, systems neuroscience.																									
Well, I don't know if that moved.																									
Or, yeah, I don't know, someone who has a neuroscience background.																									
So, I mean, this is not, it's specifically cognitive neuroscience.																									
But it's also, so the topic, we're talking about basically the precise mechanics of decoding temporal spatial frequencies.																									
I sort of tuned out a little bit with what Keshav was saying.																									
It's just that some of the things that you're talking about are beyond, a little bit beyond where the research is at currently.																									
That's my opinion from what I've read.																									
Okay, thanks. Sorry. Again, I'm a complete outsider. I've never taken organic.																									
So everything you guys can help me with over here is great.																									
Right. So, Keshav, is that, did I say that your name, right?																									
Oh, it's Keshav.																									
Okay, so when it comes to neural encoding, there aren't any, at least to my understanding, it's basically like a classification and clustering algorithm.																									
But if you're trying to model the human dynamics response, like for example, the brain actually regulates the blood flow.																									
And like into the blood, like it regulates the blood flow vis-a-vis controlling the cerebral pressure.																									
And there are state-based equations that actually dictate that. You can actually create a transfer function that can essentially model the input as well as the response of the brain actually regulating the cerebral pressure.																									
But these are like highly granular responses, like they don't actually really apply to say like decoding the brain because you have a discrete system mostly.																									
If you're trying to, at least I read out the neural response because you're just counting the spikes and neurons have certain discreetness in the way they fire.																									
So I don't know if that answers your question.																									
Oh, it helps a lot. And just to clarify then, so is there like a time series?																									
Like say, I'm modulating at a certain rep rate, I can only send in so many bits of information in a given second.																									
So is there like a limitation to how many bits you can send in for, you know, a given spatial temporal pattern?																									
Right. So this is highly constrained by then the firing pattern of neurons.																									
So if I'm not mistaken, the considering the despite the depolarization and hyperborealization of a neuron, you're looking at two to five milliseconds.																									
So that by itself would limit the amount of information that you can gather.																									
Of course, the neural link group actually has more sampling rates, and that is to create certainty in their ability to decode.																									
But on top of that, like if you're talking from biological point of view, like you're looking at a very limited time, which is like two to five milliseconds.																									
And that's widely constrained to your ability to get like a continuous time to respond because you won't be able to get that that answers your question.																									
Yeah, just sorry, I'm taking up a lot of time just want to clarify.																									
So what you're telling me is if I have a perfect good drive signal and it's nice and triangle, perhaps you're telling me that with 200 to 500 kilohertz, I'm going to match the behavior of a neuron.																									
Exactly. In fact, there are mathematical models.																									
I don't know if you heard about the Hodgkin-Huxley model, which was the earliest adoption of the earliest model, which is basically a partial differential equation,																									
which dictates how neurons fire and they were able to do that on a giant squid axon.																									
So what they did was that like they implanted electrodes into the squid axon and tried to see the response of the different, or at least I can measure the depolarization and aquaporization																									
and map that to a mathematical equation, which widely is successful and has been successful ever since I don't think there's been any modification in using that kind of model.																									
But to put it at least like in a simpler terms, yes, there are mathematical equations that you can put to model neural response,																									
and it's also going to be constrained within like you just said, 200 to 500 times.																									
But is there anybody else that's willing to take this one?																									
I think with the time series, I don't know if Nick wants to jump in in front of me because he's a very good neuroscientist.																									
But in terms of the time series, I think what you're thinking about with the Neuralink is basically watching one neuron fire after another and then another one.																									
And so from that, like the time series is probably constructed from that.																									
In terms of, yeah, two to five milliseconds, but I think the whole neuron, after it fires, it goes inhibited for a while.																									
It doesn't have any activity in the full reset time.																									
I guess I've heard it's closer to 10 milliseconds before it's sort of ready to go again.																									
Yeah, and I guess that's kind of above my pay grade as far as the data perspective.																									
But I don't think the time series is ever going to be necessarily a limitation because even with the two to five hundred hertz sampling,																									
you're going to have more than enough capture of the resolution of the single neuron.																									
It's different biophysical properties, I guess, if you will, because the average action potential, even for a very, very fast spike neuron,																									
is still like one millisecond, which you're easily going to be able to capture.																									
Then after that, you're going to have two to five milliseconds of this absolute refraction where it's not going to fire again.																									
And then after that, it can start going back on its way. So yeah, I don't think, you know, typically we use sample for most of our studies.																									
We're trying to get a really high resolution at, like, anywhere from five hundred to a thousand hertz.																									
And that's very much within the capability of picking up most, if not the entire action potential itself.																									
Can I ask you a question?																									
Can I ask why you were inquiring about the time signature?																									
Just because of your background in computing and all the processing,																									
was the time issue related to sort of an inference that you had?																									
Actually, there's two things. One, I'm wondering if this whole system is created by how much time it takes to process information,																									
in which case there is an up-and-down to how useful the neuron is, never could be.																									
So you can't sit down and watch a movie because you can't, say, have a single scene which takes you half a second to digest,																									
into twenty-four, into sixty, into seventy-two, for a seventy-two minute movie.																									
Secondly, and this is fun, so this is called a squid. It's a superconducting quantum information of one hundred pairs twice.																									
And this can sense my new identity. You can tell the person's ideas are open and trusty by the method.																									
So we're going to reach a point where we can essentially judge people's, what the muscles are doing,																									
what the neurons are individually doing in different parts of the body,																									
if people were wearing, say, a suit which has superconducting devices on it.																									
And that means that you can get tons of information out.																									
And I'm wondering if it's possible to create a feedback system which would be at par with it.																									
And for reference, suit conducting systems have very low impedance,																									
so it's not uncommon for them to work at, like, an RF frequency range.																									
So it's super, super fast, like 40 gigahertz is perfectly normal.																									
So I was wondering if you could have 40 gigahertz IO to a human brain.																									
And that would be kind of, yeah, that would be pretty awesome.																									
Well, yeah, and I don't know if it helps at all or if it's completely off point,																									
but especially in terms of if we're saying, like, augmentation of brain activity,																									
like, if you try to speed up the natural processes that are already there,																									
the neurons tend to very quickly go into, it's called paroxysmal block, where they don't fire anymore.																									
So if you try to speed up the rate of those firing of the neurons in order to say,																									
you know, take a normal process that takes one millisecond and condense it down into a tenth of a millisecond																									
in order to fit more spikes within a given unit time,																									
you're just going to end up sending the neurons into block where they're no longer going to be firing anymore.																									
And so it's sort of, you have to, at some point, maintain that time series																									
in order for them to repolarize, to fire for the next action potential, so if that makes sense.																									
Our otherwise, too, you could result in seizures as well.																									
You start firing, driving these groups of neurons at certain frequencies,																									
then you're going to result in seizures.																									
I do a lot of work with transcranial magnetic stimulation,																									
and, you know, if we start getting into higher frequencies like E, you know, even like 20 hertz,																									
but we run the risk of causing seizures and even normal individuals.																									
And to kind of get back to something that Nikki had talked about earlier with CMS,																									
we do, you know, brain stimulation like over motor cortex,																									
and someone, I think, Micah mentioned it earlier.																									
Donna Roberts?																									
She brains on life.																									
But in all of those instances, and I've, you know, done it to myself, had other people do it to me many times.																									
I mean, I always knew that I was not doing that myself,																									
that there was external stimulation to my brain causing those movements or those flashes of light																									
or speech arrest or whatever it was that was happening.																									
So I think that there's still, even with a higher resolution of a neural link,																									
that we're still going to be able to sense that this is not me, that it's not my brain that's doing this.																									
And I think it kind of gets back also to something that was talked about earlier,																									
is actually decoding signals.																									
And are we really doing that?																									
And ultimately, in order to do that, to really decode someone's signals,																									
that's going to be, that's equivalent to being able to decode consciousness.																									
So even though we might be able to put in to someone's brain stimulate the taste area of this tasting light broccoli																									
or the visual area, this is a green object that I'm eating,																									
it's still, the sense or like, I think the famous question is, what's it like to be a bat?																									
You have this physical properties, you can hear at higher frequencies, whatever,																									
but you still don't really know what it's like to be a bat.																									
And so I think it's the same thing.																									
We're not sophisticated, obviously, far off from being sophisticated enough to be able to decode signals																									
to the sense that we would, you know, that it would be consciousness or that we would mistake it for ourselves.																									
Very well said.																									
I'd like to respond to one, I have a different take.																									
So I agree with everything that Abyss and Nick and Donna said.																									
It is, it's absolutely true that there's a limit to how far you can push neurons.																									
And I learned a little bit today from what Nick said, I didn't know exactly what the process was there.																									
And really great to hear from Donna's experience.																									
My thought is on the computational, is sort of like on the computational side of things.																									
So like, if there's a fundamental limit to how much you can stimulate one neuron at a time,																									
but when you're talking about the brain and we have 86 billion neurons,																									
imagine you're trying to transfer information to the brain and if you're just doing it through one neuron at a time,																									
then yeah, you can have some hard limitations on how much information you can transfer.																									
But if you have a high bandwidth situation and you can talk to a billion neurons at a time,																									
then just imagine, just think about that, how much information do you need to send																									
																									
# Part 12																									
																									
per each frame to get a frame of the movie at a rate that makes sense for that person to see that movie, right?																									
And so if you can stimulate many neurons simultaneously, then basically like each additional neuron,																									
I mean at some point, the amount of information you're transferring is multiplying per each new unit of computation.																									
So you're like, you're speeding things up by doing things on, by math, by sort of, what's the term,																									
massive parallel computation?																									
So to add on like what Keshev actually asked earlier,																									
I found this mathematical approximation, so I have to just stop some of my earliest lecture materials,																									
but you can actually apply the discrete Dirac delta function to essentially model how neurons spike,																									
and that gives you some kind of theoretical approximation as to how neurons would actually spike in a more distributed manner.																									
I hope this answers your question or at least gives you an insight on how to use mathematical approximation.																									
In Keshev, Mika, just for others in the room, could you kind of help us, I guess, map out?																									
So based on what you just, you guys just discussed, are there any upper limits to the way things are currently being designed,																									
and would that mean that there's certain applications that in order for us to unlock other technological breakthroughs need to occur?																									
Could you guys maybe just translate that back in layman's terms for everyone in the room?																									
I guess maybe I can go.																									
So to Keshev's point, it is true there's ultimately going to be a bandwidth limit to how much information you can physically send to the human brain.																									
That's crazy to think about. I don't know what that possible limit could be, but yeah, there ultimately has to be a bandwidth rate limit.																									
But it's also possible that we will, before we even get to that, that we could figure out something more fundamental,																									
which is, so imagine if your brain is a network, because there's a book called Networking the Brain.																									
The book is, let's see, Networking the Brain.																									
Maybe I have taught it, no, Networks of the Brain.																									
So Networks of the Brain by Olaf Sporns, he's a neuroscientist, so this book is really cool.																									
But imagine that the brain is like the Internet.																									
Imagine that your neural circuits, the clusters of neurons in different neurocolumns and microcolumns,																									
they connect to each other across the entire brain like a network.																									
So the neuroscientist Olaf Sporns, he tries to use graph theory to map those connections and to sort of figure out how they work.																									
And some of the ideas of how the brain is networked yielded, some of the research yielded something called the Discovery of the Default Brain Network,																									
and another thing called the Rich Clubs, and these are basically the macroscopic structures that connect different brain areas.																									
I guess you can think of it that way.																									
But what's interesting is, what is the specific protocol, the networking protocol for communication between one part of the brain and another part of the brain?																									
And one way you can think about this problem is just consider networking protocols in general.																									
Our computers use HTTP, right?																									
So we have a whole bunch of networking protocols that you may have heard of.																									
There's one called UDP, or User Data Protocol.																									
There's one called TCP, which TCP is an old one,																									
and it requires that the two computers do a handshake first to make sure that this other computer is really here before I start sending information.																									
Whereas with UDP, I just throw the information, and I don't care if anyone else is there.																									
So that's what I mean by a network protocol.																									
Does a neuron need to know that another neural circuit is there?																									
Does it need to do a handshake first before it throws the information?																									
Or does it just send the information and just like the way UDP works?																									
So if we can figure out the particulars of the networking protocol, what's being sent, what the handshakes are, if there are handshakes, how signals are received.																									
These are important things, but it's important because if we can build artificial neurons that can take this decoded networking protocol and allow a neuron to talk to an artificial neuron,																									
well, the next step is building artificial cortex.																									
So let's say a person gets a pull through their brain and they survive, but they have missing brain tissue, right?																									
So we can put some artificial cortex in there that replaces their old cortex and now their brain isn't suffering any deficits.																									
It might be working better.																									
But we can go a step further and say, okay, well, what if we took up a completely healthy person and we gave them another cortex.																									
We call it the external cortex, right?																									
We just put it right on top.																									
It's like a hat.																									
You wear this hat and it's full of artificial brain tissue.																									
And it's networked to your actual brain, but it gives you like a second neocortex, right?																									
You just have another layer of brain, but it's artificial.																									
And it works the same way as your original brain.																									
And what's cool about it is that now instead of having like, let's say that you have 160,000 thoughts a day and let's say that you just made that up.																									
But now you have 10 times as many thoughts per second because of your artificial cortex.																									
And so for you, one idea that I had is, well, maybe if your brain is processing information 10 times faster, what if that means that your experience of time changes?																									
What if that means that relatively speaking, if you're able to perceive your world 10 times faster, that time for you slows down.																									
And that experience basically means your days are 10 times longer.																									
Now, before you say, well, that's a bad thing, I don't want, but wait a second.																									
Think of all the things you could do in one day if your days were 10 times longer.																									
That is like getting 10 times more life.																									
That's like getting 10 times more time on Earth.																									
That's the kind of thing that I'm excited about.																									
Basically, Micah, I was really freaking, yes, I'm very happy I met you, man.																									
So my main concern was, yeah, initially I was thinking there is an up about to how much information you can encode in a given time frame.																									
And if there is, there's an up about to the usefulness of any system that allows a direct input to the brain to circumvent the senses and to connect us perhaps to the internet.																									
Now, and so thinking about that, I started to consider whether there are workarounds.																									
And the best workaround I can think of was a, we can pre-process the data that is instead of sending what is, you know, the sense of a banana in your mouth or the taste of banana,																									
we can send the information of how does the brain react after you've had the banana.																									
Secondly, there's a case of parallelization because I think quite a few of you mentioned this, I'm forgetting who all mentioned this,																									
that it's possible to train one cortex to function as another form, like the auditory cortex can process visual information.																									
And as you know, when we, we can smell something, taste something, feel something, feel something and see something at the same time.																									
That means we have five different strands by which we can get information.																									
So say if you were to parallelize how fast we can see an image and have all five processing them at the same time,																									
it would be very interesting to see how much faster humans could perhaps say, find the difference between two different pictures which have subtle changes.																									
And to Micah's point, I find what is very interesting because I looked up the model, you suggested the Huxley model, the Hodgkin-Huxley model,																									
and it describes in terms of limit cycles and attractors, I think, and that is basically the vocabulary we use in nonlinear dynamics and chaos,																									
which, by the way, is how I first learned about this stuff because one of my best professors, I love this man, is looking into how the human brain is essentially a model on synchronization.																									
And we have found that with oscillators, very often of the electro or optical kind, that these graphical networks or networks of interconnected things,																									
they have, you can infer the geometry or connectedness of the network based on how they oscillate and vice versa to a decent extent.																									
And also that the geometrical setup enabled these oscillations to create a network-wide memory.																									
And I'm kind of curious where that leads in terms of, say, human memory being a product of network dynamics over time.																									
I think you might be making assumptions, though, about the limits to the interface.																									
I mean, I don't think there's necessarily limit, like, technology, there's nano-technology already, you know, let alone MEMS and micro.																									
I think it's going to be possible to get, you know, hundreds of millions of real-time input and output directly to neurons and whatever else is going on in the brain.																									
I don't know, I'm just saying if we're talking theoretically here, like, we're not necessarily limited on that front.																									
Yeah, I don't know. In terms of, like, the information, yeah, go ahead.																									
I was just going to say that, you know, a lot of these physics, the folks from physics, they're really asking questions that are a little bit disconnected from reality,																									
like, completely disconnected from reality. No offense, Keshav, but this is sort of normal.																									
So, like, in theory, like, in theory, like, there is a potential, like, ultimate limit.																									
It's just whether we reach that in this lifetime, I don't know, maybe not.																									
Can I ask you a quick question? Can I just have one quick question?																									
So, I had to leave for another meeting. I've learned a tremendous amount from Micah and Abe.																									
Keshav, you guys, my brain is stretching. I'm a layman. I just have a quick question that I'd like to take a pulse of the room,																									
which is basically for all of those of you who are in this industry, the original question was neural link is a revolutionary or a tragedy.																									
I'd love to hear your personal breakdown, like, what percentage do you think it's going to be revolutionary?																									
And what percentage do you think is going to be a tragedy? So, just, like, okay, it's going to be 50-50.																									
It's going to be 40-60. I would just love to hear from your perspective, because you guys are deep, deep, deep, deep into this tech.																									
And for a layman's perspective, I would love to get that kind of pulse. That was my question.																									
I'm Sam, and I'm done.																									
Can you be more specific? What percentage will it be revolutionary? What percentage do you think it's going to be a tragedy?																									
50-50. Well, I mean, I guess I can try to be more specific. I think in terms of the technological and kind of human,																									
I think we might be approaching a new era of human development, which is going to include, like, direct interfaces with...																									
It's not even about direct, because I think... So, it's important to, like, differentiate what is happening here,																									
when we're talking about, like, okay, first of all, there are two major aspects to narrowing. One is the medical treatment aspect,																									
which is just, like, alright, a person who is paralyzed will be able to, like, move a cursor on a screen or, like, move their arm.																									
And then there's, like, augmented, or, like, a person who can't hear better, and things like that.																									
But then there's, like, augmented aspects, which it's sort of assumed, and it's, like...																									
But that's a really big one, in my opinion. So I think that's where it can be really revolutionary,																									
because, you know, just making people hear better, that is amazing, but it's already being done.																									
So I think the augmentative stuff is, like, okay, is it possible that we're going to have new capabilities as human beings																									
with this type of technology? And I think that is possible. And I think it's kind of important to differentiate, like,																									
where, like, what are those types of new capabilities?																									
Yeah, and then in terms of tragedy, you know, I mean, like, yeah, if you have an implant, you know,																									
you might not have as much control over your thoughts and your interfaces with, like, reality,																									
and with the internet, like, as you do on a computer, you can stop using it if you want to, or use a different platform.																									
And in that situation as well, I don't actually think there's a huge difference,																									
and we have to learn to, like, differentiate between that tragedy and that problem																									
and the kind of mechanism that it's happening on, because right now, we already have the tragedy of, like,																									
you just don't have privacy on the internet. These companies own everything you do, and you don't even have a choice.																									
If you want to use the platform, you're handing off your personal life. It's kind of like,																									
if you wanted to buy a dishwasher or a washing machine in your house or, like, plumbing,																									
you have to have a microphone and a camera in your house, just because that's how plumbing works.																									
And it's just, that's pretty much what we're dealing with on the internet. That doesn't matter.																									
You don't have to have an implant. You just don't have privacy, and you don't have any control over your personal data.																									
So, I don't, a lot of people will say, like, oh, Neuralink is going to prevent us from having control of privacy.																									
Like, no, that's already happening. So, yeah, that's my two cents.																									
I'll add just one perspective here. I do think that's worth heading.																									
And, I mean, there was a time where there were multiple sub-human species, I guess you can say,																									
derivative from apes. Neanderthals and homeosapiens are just the more commonly known ones,																									
but I feel like we're heading towards a period where, because there's so many moral dilemmas																									
and various ways that our tribes can organize around, you know, decisions relating to Neuralink,																									
but also genetical engineering and all these advancements that we might have, like, you know,																									
just like today, like there are tribes in Papua New Kimi that are completely disconnected from the rest of society.																									
Then you have the Mormons who try to avoid tech, tech in the, you know, I guess the electrical sense and internet sense.																									
But, you know, if you pick up a tool, I mean, at one point when humans first picked up their first stone tools																									
and made those tools and harnessed them, that was a form of tech.																									
So, I feel like there's, like, a spectrum and we're just going to continue along that spectrum																									
and maybe have, like, a period similar to that period where there was various types of, you know, homo-species,																									
not just homosapiens, and where we would basically have some folks who are cyborgs with Neuralink implantations																									
and genetic engineering upgrades and some who basically, you know, are opposed to some of these concepts																									
and might try to avoid it altogether.																									
I do think in general it's a good idea to have diversity just as a species.																									
Anything could happen, but I think it's like swimming upstream.																									
It's just going to force most people to opt into, you know, whatever progress is kind of heading towards.																									
And ultimately the vast majority of us are going to probably have, like society's going to have technological implants,																									
if not in the next 20, 30 years, maybe in the next 50 years, whether we like it or not.																									
But I do think, yeah, it's going to come with its tragedies,																									
but I do think we're going to have, we're probably going to go through a period where there's, like, many,																									
what might feel like many different types of species because of our relationship with tech.																									
So, again, I guess, like, I also agree with what Abe said for the most part.																									
So the revolutionary part for Neuralink for me is the miniaturization,																									
that they are able to miniaturize a device that small and can be linked to, you know, the brain																									
																									
# Part 13																									
																									
and their electrode designs has also certain some novelty because it can detect on a discrete level of microcolumns.																									
But the tragedy part, I think, like something that really worries me, and I don't know if this is actually mutually shared																									
by everybody that has gone through the neural implant is that the implants don't stay long.																									
Like, the electrodes actually degrade through time because the brain is actually highly corrosive environment.																									
It has, like, rich sodium in it. It's like, you know, implanting something into an ocean.																									
It's not to say that the Neuralink electrodes are metal,																									
but there is also the risk of, you know, electrodes being breaking																									
and the immune system kind of attacking these electrodes, eventually reducing the signal strength																									
and also raising some kind of cytokine storm that would cause severe damage to the brain.																									
So I would see the tragedy part in that, but this is my opinion.																									
I don't know if it's mutually shared by others on your scientists here in this group.																									
It's interesting the regular maintenance aspect of it.																									
I wondered about, we're really worried, I guess, that the conversations we've brought up due to the topic at hand																									
about, you know, the revolutionary or tragic aspect of it.																									
Regarding the bioavailability of all of these implants																									
and the issue that you just brought up regarding maintenance,																									
I know you had actually studied this and actually gone through an experiment																									
where you implanted something in a human being and you talked about the scarring being minimal																									
and it's fairly insignificant repercussions from the damage to the brain																									
similar to existing brain-surgent applications.																									
But I'm wondering about what you just brought up with.																									
If we're constantly upgrading these additions,																									
I don't want to call them cybernetic additions, but essentially that's what they are,																									
what does that look like for when they break down?																									
I guess to try to form a thought, or to summarize this a bit better,																									
earlier on we were talking about parameters that we could put in place to protect these things																									
and what happens if you have a mouse or if you're dependent upon this tool																									
to actually utilize something, a computer or interface with something or not																									
and the system breaks, what sort of repercussions do that have?																									
And I was thinking at that time about a security option, a hardwired kill switch that you could implement																									
if in the event that something did malfunction you could simply turn all of these things off.																									
Has there been any discussion about implementing like an actual physical or as best you could get																									
physical kill switch for these implants to simply cut the contact it would have to the brain if they are implanted?																									
So Neuralink is powered by, you have to stick something behind your ear in order to power Neuralink.																									
There's no battery inside your brain.																									
That's actually, I don't think that's true anymore.																									
So I don't know if they changed it, but that was what I saw in the original demo.																									
I don't know if maybe that's not true for the monkeys, but I imagine that for human beings it would be there.																									
So if the connection is severed then it simply simply turns off if that's what you're saying.																									
If the device can't receive power, because imagine if you take this home you're going to want to do surgery to replace your batteries																									
so it makes sense that if you're not a monkey in a laboratory that you would stick a device behind your ear																									
and that's how you would power the device and if you needed to take it off, like in an emergency way																									
then pull the device off from behind your ear and what it's just going to do is remove the power from the device.																									
Something tells me humans generally tend to migrate towards Wi-Fi capability more than hardware though.																									
So I would assume anyway that at some point in time they would try to figure out some sort of wireless capability																									
or wireless functionality simply from a convenience play, but that's really interesting.																									
My question, it came out a bit weird, but it was actually around the security around everything																									
so we were talking about the tragic consequences of having manipulation																									
and it could even be the case of people sending signals to these transmitters to cause an auditory hallucination																									
or some sort of a man-in-the-middle attack if you will inside the brain.																									
And I was thinking like the easiest solution to prevent that in the event that some signals were getting stimulated																									
inside the transmitter would just be like a kill switch similar to what we have on high security computers																									
or cell phones now where you can simply press a button and it actually severs the connection between the camera or microphone, etc.																									
and the computer so that it can't be accessed in the event that it has been breached by a significant actor																									
who can maybe turn it on without notifying anybody or using the lights or whatever.																									
So that was kind of where my train of thought was going with it and then I thought regarding the maintenance issue																									
if these things are malfunctioning it would make the most sense to simply just be able to turn it off																									
but it goes back to that question about regular maintenance and everything.																									
What happens if you have a significantly misfiring something inside your head																									
and needs to be taken out rapidly?																									
If I could throw a wrench in the conversation here																									
it's the idea that future attacks might be so sophisticated that you don't know that there's anything wrong.																									
And so you wouldn't have any reason to hit a kill switch or to pull the power																									
and no one else around you would have any reason to either.																									
You just think everything is fine.																									
So I'm probably going to answer at KShift's point because like you raised a very good question earlier																									
and it's time for me to turn it anyway so I just wanted to answer that before I leave.																									
So there is a floating theory that a memory can be encoded in the network itself																									
instead of simply by strengthening the synaptic connection between neurons																									
and the theory is called connectome so it's gaining wide popularity																									
and there have been some computational neuroscience,																									
aspects trying to demonstrate that it's possible to encode some kind of memory in a higher dimension manifold																									
and this was done by the Blueprint project I think it's in Switzerland.																									
So it's a very interesting idea to see that the network itself is capable of storing information																									
instead of like I said by merely strengthening or weakening the synaptic connections in the brain.																									
So I just wanted to mention it out there and this has been a great discussion.																									
Thank you guys.																									
Thanks for joining us Abis.																									
I had a question and Matt's offered to continue the room if anybody wants to continue																									
but I had a question for dropping off or for Mika, Abe, Nick and anyone else who thinks they could sort of help																									
provide some insight around this.																									
So I mean Abe you had mentioned obviously the work that led up to Neuralink the precursor																									
and your involvement in it maybe you might be able to comment on this																									
but like what like specifically because a lot of folks when they think okay Neuralink commercialized something																									
you know like they might overly simplify what that means you know it's not simply you know putting up a billboard																									
and saying hey we want we have something we want to sell you there's likely a series of																									
maybe smaller engineering problems or problems in general that they have to have gone through																									
and solved to achieve economies of scale to achieve you know some of the efficiencies that they have																									
could maybe some of you guys maybe chime on some of those recent things that they would have had to have solved																									
in the last few years to get to where they are.																									
I know this sounds pretty in some ways ignorant because you've already mentioned that they a lot of what they've done																									
has been done in labs today.																									
So what I'm really speaking to is you know just along the steps of like outside of the core things																									
I'm convinced they haven't invented anything new and we've actually had that discussion offline earlier this morning																									
my question is more around like what are the specific problems that they did they solve you know that helped us get to																									
the current technology that they have today.																									
I imagine there was at least an handful of engineering or other types of problems.																									
Could anyone comment on that?																									
I haven't answered but I'll let anyone else who wants to go first go first.																									
Okay I guess it's me.																									
So Neuralink they created a microsurgery robot it implants these microfibers with their each one has like a 16 electrodes																									
with such precision it does like really microscopic imaging you know it's they're able to have pictures on it																									
if you look at the Facebook group self-aware networks of the Facebook group neurophysics these groups that I've been running for 10 plus years																									
and in some instances there's pictures up there on the cover photos that show you the basically Neuralink's																									
what it looks like through the camera they're basically imaging the blood vessels at really high resolution																									
and then the robot is using a neural networking algorithm to plot to identify areas where there aren't blood vessels																									
so they can pick areas that are good targets for surgery and then a neurosurgeon is supposed to approve																									
to say I agree with what the machine is saying these are excellent targets to implant electrodes																									
and then the machine has to do it because the needles are too delicate for human hands to handle																									
and the precision required is I believe it's too much for the hands of a neurosurgeon so the robot has to do it																									
and this way like imagine so I don't know if people saw the movie Prometheus but then the movie was interesting																									
because it's not the first movie to have this but it's maybe the best reference																									
the movie has a robot in it actually it has like a capsule machine that does surgery																									
so at one point the character has an alien in her stomach or something I might be messing up the story																									
she has something she wants to get out of her stomach and she goes to the surgery machine and it's only calibrated for men																									
so she's really upset about that but she says okay I want to remove this thing from my stomach																									
and then the computer does the surgery automatically so the idea that in the future we will have machines that do surgeries																									
like a vending machine that does the surgery that's sort of like a big component to mass producing medicine																									
in the next 100 years is basically to have the precision of surgery so well done by a computer that is better than a human being could do it																									
and then you could eventually put it in a vending machine and mass produce surgeries																									
so that is an incredible innovation																									
Can I chime in? Can I make a comment? My name is George Zavala, I am a neurologist so obviously I don't do research in this area																									
but I am familiar with technologies that are currently being used for clinical practices																									
and these modalities have been standardized and tested and they're pretty safe																									
so what you're telling me with the grids of electrodes placed on the surface of the brain																									
this is something that is done currently and you are right there are several types of machines or robots if you want to call them																									
they help people not only to place these grids in the surface of the brain but also to find out where you're going to put them																									
so this is used mostly for people who have complex type of epilepsies where medication is not working																									
and you want to localize where the seizures are being triggered so you can maybe remove them through surgery																									
and this technology is broadly used obviously not in country side hospitals but in the major centers where you have a comprehensive epilepsy center																									
and this type of procedure is performed and I am assuming that there is some type of collaboration between Neuralink and companies																									
that already do these devices because it would be silly for one not to use this technology that's already available																									
and try to reinvent the wheel so I'm pretty sure that there will be some collaboration there																									
and another aspect that I think is really interesting to notice is that there is another company that produces this thing called Stentrode																									
probably some of you in the audience have seen this before and are familiar with it																									
but this is a technology where the electrodes are not being placed by neurosurgery but they are being implanted in the brain																									
in the blood vessels of the brain they've done a few studies with shapes and I don't think they used monkeys																									
they used mostly shapes but they are starting to do this in humans as well																									
and the goal of this technology is obviously very different from Neuralink but these electrodes are being placed in the motor cortex																									
so the part of the brain that controls movement and they are using these electrodes to control artificial limbs																									
and people who have been victims of amputations or war mutilations and so forth																									
there is an older technology that's already readily available but that requires neurosurgery																									
but Stentrode is doing a similar thing minimally invasively so they just go the same way people have a catheter put in their hearts																									
when they have a heart attack it's a similar concept where the stent goes into a blood vessel in the brain																									
and that's how the process starts and obviously everything is transmitted wirelessly																									
now just taking a step back when I think it was Matt who was talking about malfunctioning																									
obviously we do have a lot of brain devices that are available																									
I don't know if you guys know anything about deep brain stimulation but this is also a technology that's used for modulating brain activity																									
not for cognitive functions like Neuralink is planning to do																									
but for people for example who have intractable Parkinson's disease or also people with epilepsy																									
people with various types of neurological conditions																									
so these devices they're very safe they are made of material that do not cause any inflammatory reactions to the brain tissue as was mentioned before																									
and I'm assuming that this is the type of material that also Neuralink is planning to use																									
because again you don't want to reinvent the wheel if there's something that's already very safe to use																									
now these devices deep brain stimulation they are probably the ones that are most used in the medical in the neurological community																									
and what's interesting about these devices is that once implanted very deep in the brain																									
there is a wire that comes externally and under the skin out of the skull and under the skin																									
and ends in your chest under the skin in your chest and through there so there is a battery there that operates the machine or the device																									
but also through there wirelessly with something like a tablet or your iPhone																									
you can control the amount of stimulation or inhibition that you want to the structure of the brain that's causing trouble																									
so all these technologies are there obviously not for the purpose that Neuralink is using																									
but things that are safe things that can be used quite widely and it's very doable																									
so I want to believe that these guys from Neuralink are talking to people or manufacturers who are doing these known devices																									
just finally the main problem when these things stop functioning is that most of the studies that are done																									
for example one day in your life you will need to have an MRI scan of your brain and as you know an MRI is a giant magnet																									
so a lot of these devices they are MRI compatible provided that the battery is functioning																									
now we probably assume that if the battery is flat it is going to be safe as well																									
but all the studies were done with patients with full batteries so this is always a problem that if someone has a device like this																									
and they are needing an MRI for other reasons and the battery is flat nobody is going to go ahead and do it																									
and once you have a device implanted in your brain there is scar tissue that forms around it and getting rid of it is going to be very difficult																									
if not impossible without causing any damage thank you																									
okay can I, I'd love to respond to what George, did you say George or Jorge?																									
you guys I got it, whatever you prefer man call me anything																									
I'd love for you to respond to the mods, Abe and Mika I'd love for you to respond to George																									
but just one question like the applications that George has Abe Mika are you guys very familiar with some of the technologies referring to?																									
yes I am top off but thanks so much to the mods and have a great night																									
take care Abe																									
twice I'm heading out just wanted to say thanks Dan this has been fun																									
okay thank you																									
so in fact if anyone else is leaving go ahead and say so I'll just be quiet for a second																									
sounds good																									
so in fact I have written the best intro tonight interviewed Dr. David Petrino PhD at Mount Sinai																									
Tom Oxley																									
okay																									
right so Tom Oxley he's an instructor and a director of innovation strategy for the department of neurosurgery at Mount Sinai																									
and he specializes in vascular neurosurgery and interventional neurology																									
my article is if you go to sdgn.io and you type in the word stentrode you can read the article and includes a recorded audio dialogue that I did with stentrode																									
so stentrode does not require brain surgery																									
it's amazing so you can inject it into your arm																									
and then you push it up through the blood vessels into the brain but in the blood vessel somewhere above the motor cortex as it has already been said																									
and then what happens as you withdraw the device that what happens is after it reaches where it's supposed to be and you withdraw your implantation device																									
what happens is the stentrode expands inside the vein so that it basically presses outward against the walls of the vein																									
and basically it allows the maximum amount of flow through the vein it's not going to block the vein at all																									
and then the electrodes are basically in the wall of that vein that's above your motor cortex																									
just quickly there Micah this is the same technology that's used for unblocking a blood vessel that caused a myocardial infection or heart attack for example																									
or if someone has a big stroke keep going																									
wow so I didn't know that but that makes perfect sense but it's like yeah it's like they did that																									
and then they just say hey not only are we going to put this in someone's brain to open their blood vessels but we can stick electrodes there at the same time																									
the application Micah so this is fascinating because you're also heavily in this and you're learning from George as you speak as well																									
which is really fascinating for me am I hearing this correctly Micah so Micah yeah																									
in George is this the application was initially used or as you said to unclog blood vessels and other sort of applications like that																									
and these guys have flipped it and used it to now insert wires is that correct																									
can I tell you the story how this started because I was there when it started																									
so Tom Oxley was a neurology trainee in the hospital where he used to work in 2011 and always a very fascinating clever guy																									
so this is a technology that back then for neurology was being used for retrieving clots that were causing strokes in big blood vessels in the brain																									
and this is a technology that's been available probably since 2014 or 15 I would say																									
sorry 2005 2006 but it really became a hype in the late 2000 first decade of the 2000s and early 2010s																									
and this technology now is amazing so this is pretty much a state which is a device that goes flat into a clot opens up																									
and then when it opens up clot gets attached to it and they pull it out very sophisticated way of doing this																									
so Tom was he actually was a military doctor before he became a neurology trainee																									
and he took a year off and he went to the US and one day he sent an email to the guy who was one of the directors of DARPA																									
and somehow he got a meeting to see this guy and he said now I have to come with a clever idea																									
and he had this he tells me he had this light bulb moments and he thought why don't we do this																									
I'll tell this guy that we're going to use this for putting a recording electrodes trying to maybe in the future																									
use this technology for moving artificial limbs so it was pretty much a combination of two technologies that were already available																									
the unblocking of the blood vessels plus the recording electrodes that I used for monitoring people with epilepsy																									
keep going Micah																									
I don't know that I have a whole lot more to say except I just I just I shared the story																									
you wanted to add to that or but this is so what exactly did Neuralink where did they step into this story																									
like well this technology existed I know when Dave was here earlier like they were talking about a different type of technology																									
that was being inserted in the brain he had a picture of it on his profile earlier																									
and so what exactly did Neuralink do with these things Micah																									
hey sorry I was having a little trouble with my mute button there																									
so I what I want to say first of all is if you if you click on my profile right now and visit my Twitter																									
and look at the the latest thing that I shared not my pin post but the latest post that I just shared																									
that is a link to the story about Centrode so that will be basically the best starting point is to read that story and listen to the interview that I recorded																									
but so what was also brought so Centrode is you know we so I I'm kind of like I'm a little bit at the at the end of what I can say about Centrode for right now there's more in the article																									
but I sort of like want to get back to to DBS and Neuralink that's for my this is right at the moment maybe maybe we can go back to Centrode later																									
so when Neuralink first																									
Micah can I ask you one quick question before you leave Centrode is it just for clarification arteries or veins																									
so the the stents goes the the use the the original stents designed for retrieving clots was going into arteries																									
but these arteries they are of a certain caliber and the stents that had the electrodes were too big for it																									
so for Centrode the technology is slightly different because it's going into big veins that you have in the surface of your brain																									
so one of them goes from right in the midline from front to back on top of your of your brain right below underneath your skull																									
and then there are two other ones that go at the back of your head to the so coming from the midline to the to the sides and then down your neck																									
so so what I what I heard which is not not going to be as accurate as what he what which is said but what I the the story that I wrote down was that																									
the Centrode is inserted via a catheter into the jugular vein and then maneuvered into the brain via the vasculature and there's no there's no																									
basically the I just wrote that there's no need to drill through the human skull the sensors are built into a self-expanding stent that expands into the wall of the blood vessel																									
and in time it's expected that cells will grow over the sensors and incorporate them into the tissue and then the signals would be transported out of the brain																									
through the vein to a unit implanted in the chest and from there the signals from the brain would be sent to the computer																									
I don't know if it's still up to date but the Centrode records brain activity in a way that's I guess similar to EEG or or ECOG																									
which are like surgically implanted electrodes and but the advantage of being inside the skull is is is massive																									
I mean that's just basically the field of ECOG research right and just skimming skimming my article see if there's anything other here that I wrote down																									
but yeah so check out check out you can check out pain pain medication reimagined was wasn't was something that so David Petrina was talking about the																									
the he's a PhD but he was talking about the work by																									
you said his name earlier																									
by by Tom by Tom Oxley who Tom J. Oxley MD and PhD																									
part of the cerebral cerebral vascular center																									
yeah anyway so I mean I think that it's just like I think that you know																									
so a lot of people this is this is interesting because a lot of people who have been studying COVID-19 and effects on the brain have been like																									
what we don't get how COVID-19 could get into the brain we don't understand why why it's affecting the brain like what what is it how is it																									
where are the are the ace two receptors and well																									
I guess maybe it was overlooked but the brain has a lot of blood vessels and it has a lymphatic system and throughout the blood vessels and the lymphatic system there's there's there's a there's a lot of																									
what's that you know there's a lot of cells that have what's called an endothelial lining and that endothelial lining has ace two receptors so																									
I I don't know why it's it's it's a big mystery but but but but yeah it seems pretty obvious																									
hey guys just want to quickly jump in and kind of introduce the dent to everyone																									
always a pleasure co-hosting our disruptors then sessions we had a lot of new faces today and lots of new speakers																									
a lot of our topics including this one today are sponsored by audience members like you also if you're interested in contributing or have any feedback																									
please reach out to myself or Ravi we're always looking to expand our group of disruptors																									
we're building this great platform for you to share your thoughts and introduce yourself what you're working on and also finding like minded amazing people that you can connect with																									
in more depth offline and I observed a lot of connections being made live as the discussion was running so that's amazing																									
we do do this every Monday to Saturday 9 to 10 p.m. Eastern time so everyone in the room right now hit that disruptors then icon at the top																									
and hit that fall button bring a friend invite people that you think would be a great addition and yeah let's continue this discussion sorry for interrupting there																									
sounds great thank you myra is that hey yeah well I wanted to add that so George also brought up DBS																									
and so when Neuralink was first announced they made a lot of comparisons to DBS and they pointed out that their device is much smaller																									
DBS the implantation of DBS can can rupture a lot of micro micro vessels micro blood vessels that's part of it's part of the I believe that's part of the reason that there's a long term sort of scarring issue																									
the device is really big compared to Neuralink the idea here is that Neuralink is going to cause far less scarring that the you know I don't know that the materials are that different																									
but there's far less of them there has been some research which was sort of pre Neuralink which suggested that if you make your if you make the devices you put inside the head made out of graphite																									
that the immune system would not react to them and there's also so Neuralink came out with one of their announcements was that they had implanted the devices into pigs																									
and the pigs are you know they like to bang their heads together they're little rock stars and so far the devices were not breaking																									
so I guess they're thin enough and small enough and light enough that the pig could bang its own head against other pigs heads and it wasn't causing these really light and small hairs																									
which contain the electrodes to break and that's interesting because you know the brain is basically like it's really soft it's almost like jelly or butter																									
it's painful to think about how delicate the brain is but yeah so if you put something heavy in there and it gets knocked around then the potential for scarring like with the DBS																									
the big DBS system seems pretty like a big deal and just putting it in there could cause bleeding and other problems in fact like the first 10 years of brain surgeries																									
in history of medical neuroscience and this is a true story the first 10 years of brain surgery not a single patient survived because they couldn't figure out for the long for 10 years																									
they couldn't figure out how to cut into the brain without killing the patient because there are literally blood vessels everywhere everywhere																									
it was extremely it took 10 years for humanity to figure that out so																									
Micah on that point it sounds like there's a bit of material engineering work that was done in terms of the advancements they did with the actual material but how did they advance the technology so that they can minimize scarring and cutting into blood vessels																									
was that a bit of software engineering like in terms of you know analyzing the topology of the brain before they did the insertions what sort of stuff was going on there in terms of advancements																									
I don't know if George or Micah can answer that																									
so without working there I can just answer that in a very general way that very fast basically to make surgeries better and less traumatic on a patient you have to make them less invasive less impactful you have to make the surgical the surgery has to be smaller the cutting area has to be smaller																									
you want to stick as little as possible into the human body or human brain and you want to you want to do really good imaging ahead of time to figure out exactly where you need to cut and what you need to cut and with and so in a sense the																									
micro surgery robot that narrow link builds does two things one is it does really high resolution microscopic imaging of the brain area where it's going to be implanted so you can get you can get a look at the blood vessels but then to also like figures out where the the you know what areas are the best for implanting the electrodes																									
and then it implants them so that that's basically the general idea and then of course you know there's a long history of materials design and and and trying to try to find stuff that's at least offensive to me being I think that answers a question without specifics																									
yeah I mean this this this is incredible this has been really really helpful folks who some of the folks who are contributing left but you know I initially walked into this whole like when I started observing your link I it looked at you know in the realm of R&D and I																									
had no idea that this there's this in this much prior work that has led to led up to their their their I guess contribution to the overalls you know advancement of this of the stuff you know this is you know if you look at Tesla like that there was																									
an electric car that Elon had acquired and obviously there was a lot of work that had to be done to get to where it is today but the concept of you know the strategy and the concept of you know starting with a luxury car working																									
really towards an economically feasible one that was baked into the initial vision I think of Tesla was first started and in many ways like when I when I'm listening to the various domains and the prior applications that have already been tested including the monkey example																									
including now the surgery that George is talking about here and you Micah it's like yeah it's it's it's a cradle to me that a lot of a lot of people don't know just how much work has led up to this moment and maybe partly due to Elon's popularity																									
and you know recognition but and also their contribution to commercializing this I don't want to under you know value that but it's it's I'm just shocked at how much prior work and invention and application and even understanding these use cases had already																									
existed and been discussed before New Orleans showed up to the party and you know it's really impressive stuff but just as now blown away but all the work that you guys are have been involved in and thank you for for you know sharing all this																									
so I think there's there's there could be a big perspective shift for everybody if you just think of this this isn't this is not Elon Musk's company just just imagine that he had he he's he's the guy who's funding it																									
and not the reason I said that I say that because what what what I'm getting at is like you know there was someone who basically you know it I forget his name but there was a neuroscientist who was the first to measure e.g. signals																									
and he he thought that you know basically he read this letter where he heard that a woman had written about like her boyfriend she had the stream that her boyfriend fell off a horse and at the same time she wrote a letter her																									
boyfriend had fallen off the horse and so he thought well well maybe our brains maybe there's maybe it's telepathy so he wanted to measure to see if the he wanted to measure electrical signals in the brain to see if if he wanted to																									
detect them and analyze them and he did and he was he was basically the like the grandfather of e.g. because he wanted to see if telepathy was real and it turns out that he also he did he did really good work and it turns out that he was able to																									
to do his own disappointment realize that that e.g. signals don't travel far enough there's not enough power in them that they could leave one person's brain and and and travel to another person's brain through the air it's just not it's not it wouldn't work that way																									
but you know that so but in a real sense e.g. and also you know just measuring electrodes there's another guy who was was famous for he he was a famous he was the guy who a neuroscientist who came up with																									
I'm sorry I'm not being very good with names tonight but but he basically was implanting electrodes into cats into their brains and he figured out that neuro columns he was the first guy to say well neuro columns have a function and and																									
and at some at some point the idea that different parts of your brain had different functions what was unheard of and in human history and so he's like yeah so your neuro column does something special it's different from what the rest of your brain is doing and it's organized it's																									
somehow it's organizing what you know the cat's reaction to to being petted or something like that right and it's organizing this this this mental activity and so so so that so so we so then we had lots of you know we had many decades																									
of people sticking electrodes in cats and mice and and rodents and monkeys and human beings and and we had the of course ecog and we had the Utah ray which was mentioned earlier and dbs and and so so all of these																									
technologies so if you look at who's hired by narrow link you can see that that one of the one of the guy one of the guys who's hired was a djco and he was the co-founder of neural dust and neural dust I wrote about																									
the other co-founder so I didn't know I didn't I missed the I guess I need to write another one about djco but I wrote about his co-founder and then this was before narrow link sort of like																									
had their big reveal and and shared who was working there but if you look at the people who worked there and there's been a lot of turnover but the people who worked over time so I think it was George that brought up he says I hope that something																									
like I hope that that they're talking to all the companies and the scientists who have worked with dbs and all and and and and stent road and and the thing is for a fact many of the world's leading scientists are working at at narrow link and have been working at																									
narrow link or previously worked at narrow link I mean it's been a long narrow link has been around for years and inside and people have come and gone but in great numbers but the thing is like there is a vast amount of communication happening between the																									
leading minds and in neuroscience for a neurology and you know cognitive cognitive neuroscience and and and it's just so yeah so to George's like question this it's not it's only yes they ought to be doing it yes they have for a fact																									
been talking to you know the leading minds and the leading companies this has been happening these people have been working at narrow link so that's just what I wanted to say																									
I I think it's it's can you guys hear me I think it's worth mentioning as well that everything that you in plans on the body needs to go through approval from regulatory companies																									
but not companies entities like the FDA in the US TGA here in Australia so every country has that so I'm pretty sure that if you want to take shortcuts and make your your implants work quicker you probably use substances that have been approved to to be implanted																									
rather than again trying to invent something that might or might not work if I can ask where you mentioned something about the scarring regarding implants being a factor earlier on I think we had some some previous discussion around																									
this evening and people were talking about how it's not going to be so critical but how in your opinion as a neurosurgeon like how critical is it or what is the impact and is there a difference between the age of a patient based on their neuroplasticity and their ability to recover from that																									
scarring so obviously the the age is very important the younger the person the more likely that there will be effective and less damaging regeneration of brain tissue that's no doubt obviously once once you reach a certain age there is virtually no																									
no chance that someone can have a 100% guarantee that their brain tissue is going to regenerate so the what happens is that when you put in a device like this I think I might I might have misused the term scar tissue																									
what happens is that some tissue from the body organizes around the structure so for example the stents that we were mentioned before the stentrodes and cardiac stents and kidney stents and everything has stents in the body these days																									
once you put inside a blood vessel there is a lining inside the blood vessel that's called endothelium which is a lining of cells so this endothelium grows on top of the stent and the stent gets incorporated into the vessel so if you if you are small enough to go into the vessel																									
or hey you have a camera that's small enough and go into the vessel and you and you look at the vessel from inside you're not going to see the stents because it's been endothelized as we say so it's going to happen with these																									
with these devices is that probably there will be tissue that will grow on top of it and make it part of the body so you're not going to be able to see the device in its entirety but the problem is that as someone was mentioned before if you want for some reason get it out of your body																									
then you're going to create a lot of problems it's like it's easy for you to build something with concrete and put it on the floor or on the ground but when you remove it a lot of dirt comes out with it so the same concept would happen in the brain																									
but the brain is so delicate that any additional or any damage that you do to your brain tissue it's going to cause trouble and particularly with these devices like Neuralink for example you're stimulating the probably the most important part of your brain which is you right your intelligence																									
your sense of self-being and I don't think that this is the type of device that will be able to come in and out very easily so once it's implanted well prior to implanting the decision needs to be made very carefully and the person needs to be aware that for whatever reason this should stay with them forever																									
is that clear? very very thank you very much for that																									
I'm sorry one thing to mention too is that I'm a neuro radiologist and I see what it looks like after electrodes have been implanted and also for epilepsy surgery trying to figure out where the seizure focus is																									
electrodes get implanted for like just a few days at a time and then taken out but these electrodes and also deep brain stimulation electrodes and I don't know the numbers but are much larger than the type of electrodes that we're talking about here with Neuralink being the size of human hair																									
I mean the electrodes that are put in for epilepsy surgery mapping I'm always amazed when I see these and they go you know going all the way across the brain and then they're taken out and don't leave scarring so I can't imagine																									
well can I interrupt you the reason why there is no scarring is because they're there only for a limited time right so when you do these monitoring for epilepsy you keep the grids for what two weeks three weeks and then it comes out because these patients when they are being monitored for epilepsy surgery																									
they need to stay in hospital you can't take the grids with you home be monitored home and then come back so they usually in hospital for a certain number of days so they can have a seizure captured																									
and then the biggest number of seizures captured so you can be sure that they are all coming from that foci and then you can act on it through surgery or whatever method you're using																									
right no I didn't mean to imply that that the electrodes do come out within a few days but still you've sliced through brain you've displaced brain as these electrodes are being placed so you're displacing brain tissue and they're much larger than the electrodes that Neuralink is going to use the size of a human hair																									
I find it really fascinating I had my father was a like a type personality high functioning individual like a director of cybersecurity for an energy company and he was in his mid fifties and suffered he started having some symptoms regarding his motor control																									
and he went in and he was diagnosed with cavernoma and had to have some some fairly significant brain surgery to remove some some malignant tumors so they were non cancerous but it was a it was you know significant impact																									
primarily related to his motor control functions and that was back in 2018 and he's been in rehabilitation since and trying to recover from it and he it took him years but with his older age there was a significant impact on his state I guess if you will																									
now his intelligence was it did seem to be impacted thank goodness so he's he's cognitive but it's it's the motor control and when you mentioned I guess when I was kind of probing around asking around the the damage or the potential for damage for these plants																									
it was more or less like what happens when a person who's younger gets one and like you said or hey when you they might have to live forever how what happens if the technology you know certainly frogs and a more or better implant comes out 10 years 20 years down the road																									
you know what could you apply a different one or would you have to take the chance of removing it and risking I have a I have an answer to this and I'm pretty sure that our radiologist colleague also knows all about this as well but in medicine everything that's prosthetic or foreign to the body does not last forever																									
so and just to give you an example for example so if you have severe arthritis of your hip and you need a new hip we try to delay the operation for as long as possible because we know that even the most modern prosthesis they will last for what 15 years or so in your body and then you have to change it again																									
so I am and also with if someone has an aneurysm which is a like a blister on the side of a blood vessel and it bursts into the brain they can have either coils or or neurosurgical clips applied to these to these aneurysms and we do know that the clips they only last for so long as well																									
so obviously the coils they do last for longer but they are much smaller structures so it's going to be very interesting to see how long and only time will tell how long neural link is going to stay in the brain without causing any trouble																									
and and also what certain age will be the age where you can will be able to implement these devices into one's brain because I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't want a adolescence or a teenager to have this implanted to their brains because we don't know what's going to happen in the longer term																									
and not only that our brain obviously all the cells are there when we are born but the connections they keep on happening up until you are in your mid 20s and so the structures of the brain they only finish maturing when you are in your mid 30s																									
so you don't want to get anything that's going to interfere with this process if you don't know that this is going you don't know how it's going to behave if this is giving you a benefit and giving you better connections yes but how are you going to be able to prove those fights probably impossible isn't it																									
well as a neurologist I'd have to ask right if you had a you know the original use case of neural link is for people who are paralyzed right to try to give them some sort of communication point to the outside world if you had an adolescent patient who would significantly benefit from a life																									
lifestyle change by implementing neural link what would you how would you weigh out the benefits or the drawbacks of providing them this this you know device even though what you just said right you may significantly alter their neurological																									
growth of the years yeah well then it's a different question because if someone did you say someone who had a brain damage and then they had a paralysis of their body is that what you're saying whatever the whatever the current use case for your neural link is now right																									
I believe it's for like paralysis or brain yeah so if you have if you have someone who has a brain lesion that has already caused irreversible change to that area of the brain and you want to try to compensate that lack of function by implementing something																									
that's artificial and is going to work I don't see any harm in that I think that this is a medicine is all about risks and benefits every medication every vaccine every procedure has risks and benefits so I think that in this sort of situation																									
where you have even someone with a cerebral palsy someone who has a damage to their brain tissue because of lack of oxygen when they're being delivered by their moms if someone is has paralysis in one side of the body because of that then there's nothing to lose I totally agree with the																									
with the concept of implementing things to make their lives better and have a near normal life but if it's something just to enhance functions that you have now and that are considered normal I think still a little bit risk I think to be honest with you I think																									
that in the future we'll have that opportunity but I think that we are very far from that that time we'll have to prove in people with brain damage that this works prior to using this as a brain enhancer that's my point of view																									
and in that situation that you mentioned that if you if someone was paralyzed and and there wasn't this artificial stimulation replacement then what would happen anyway is that brain tissue would wear away																									
it's called wallerine degeneration because it's not getting stimulated so in fact you would be enhancing retaining that tissue and I think the thing that happened perhaps with your father is that when the surgery was done they could that there was perhaps																									
some because of how deep the cavernoma was there could have been injury to the white matter tracks in the motor area and perhaps that's what's causing some of his weakness but in the case of neural leak again the the electrodes are going to be so small the size																									
of the human hair that they would not disrupt the white matter tracks and I think what he was saying earlier was whenever it is time to upgrade in 10 to 15 years you're just going to have to leave the ones that are already there there and get new ones in addition																									
so I want to I want to share something that I want to share two points one is that you know so so the white matter tracks that some that's there's two things happening one is you have a ligodendrocytes that are covering those are cells that those cells are covering the axons or the body of neurons that are																									
covering the axons and and those run those run great lengths they in some cases they might run from your head to your toes right they're really long but but what's interesting is that the the the																									
white waxy stuff that is covering the neurons it's not like it's just it's not like one a ligodendrite and one neuron it's like they're going every different direction and you might have you might have a thousand different																									
ligodendrocytes touching one neuron it's it's it's a it's a little bit chaotic and so going back to George's point it's like imagine so imagine you've got a wire in there that's about the length of the human hair and then what happens is a cell a cell just randomly grows around																									
that wire now now sell it imagine the cell is like a bubble it's basically a lipid bubble or a bubble of fat it's got it really matters if that bubble is is has any punctures or holes in it that that's a big issue for that cell																									
and so if you just if you if it grows around a wire and you just pull the wire out no matter how small that wire is now there's a puncture in that bubble so you see the problem there																									
and so if you look at in the case of you know what is what is SARS-CoV-2 doing to the body well it's it's it's it's the viruses is invading and it's causing these cells to burst and and I can maybe just having just just pulling																									
that that's the hair out of the cell might might cause it to burst I don't I don't know exactly but that's just a picture I wanted to paint for you another thing I think Travis said that he believed that maybe we were moving towards a world where everybody has these																									
impossible devices my my thought is a little bit different in 20 years I think that will have basically will have optical technology that will be integrated with basically like like open water technology but it'll be laser fast it'll be																									
it'll be like something like laser optical holographic technology that's integrated with ultrasound and and microwaves and it will non-invasively do do effectively the same thing that their link does without surgery outside your brain you'll have to worry about it																									
yeah I can I can I comment I have two comments about this number one I agree I agree with you and I think that this is probably the ideal way of this happening and I don't know whether you guys are familiar with the technology called																									
transcranial magnetic stimulation but this is a technology that's a through through waves or radio frequency you can stimulate certain parts of the brain and and and it's something that's being used for actually treatment of																									
of depression because we do know so the centers how they cause or are responsible with the physiology of depression or how depression happens and we do know that if you stimulate these centers patients can have temporary relief of their																									
depressive symptoms so transcranial magnetic stimulation is probably the closest we're getting to what you you're talking about the problems that the that the few disease to the coverage of TMS is very wide and you can't have a																									
stimulation of a very very small or even a microscopic area so obviously I think that if we can get a device through laser beam or optical stimulation that'll be ideal but I think that this this subject is so complex and sorry I don't I don't																									
I don't mean to to sound very unreasonable here or or to too much of a dream but I think it's probably going to be easier for us to think about computer singularity and sharing our brains with the hardware devices																									
than having a structure like Neuralink that's going to be able to control a biologic body the way they are thinking about so I think the way singularity is is evolving these days is so much faster than the way biological enhancement is evolving																									
that I'm not entirely sure whether when Neuralink or the equivalents become available we won't have something far superior for silicon bodies I just want to say that I'm very familiar with TMS but I do believe it's oversold and it's not appropriate in all cases of depression																									
especially cases where the depression is caused by a metabolic disorder because if basically the idea is you know you're blasting the brain with a bunch of energy that's that is it is a you know that there is a previous version of that in the like 1960s I think in psychology where they're called electroconvulsive shock therapy																									
which turned out to be a really big disaster there's a huge differences with transcended magnetic stimulation compared to electroconvulsive therapy it's far more it's far more targeted and it's like very precise in terms of the frequencies that it's stimulating your brain with																									
so it's it's different in many respects but the idea here is that if a person is suffering from depression because their cells are not able to to to process enough you know addendo triphosphate addensity and triphosphate you know or ATP if they're unable to make enough energy then giving that person you know a TMS treatment is not going to really help them in the long term																									
that it may actually make things worse.																									
I'm sorry again I might not express myself appropriately I was just giving you an example in like most things in medicine there's no such thing as one size fits all right so there is depression and depression there is stroke and stroke there is all conditions in there																									
several types of presentation so yes I didn't mean that this is a magical solution for depression sorry.																									
And one other thing I am I'm actually funded by NASA and we're using TMS to enhance enhance cognition and and so we're applying that over the frontal lobes and and and I think one of the biggest drawbacks about TMS is the depth that doesn't go deep enough to get to																									
deeper structures like limbic structures in other areas I think that's one of the biggest drawbacks of TMS and one other thing Micah is that is that electric convulsive therapy.																									
It can be a disaster but it can also be a lifesaver and it still is in use today and and very severe cases of depression but in those cases it can really be a lifesaver.																									
Yeah I mean I there's there's yeah I can't disagree with you at all that there's and I think I think the idea behind behind DBS or deep brain stimulation is sort of vaguely similar.																									
If you have someone who whose depression or or other PTSD isn't related to a metabolic disorder and they really just need more stimulation then then everything we just mentioned might might potentially including what wasn't mentioned TDCS those all might be helpful depending on what the patients needs are.																									
KKJ you wanted to say something.																									
Yeah I was kind of curious.																									
To Donna's point I think she mentioned at the very end of one of her remarks.																									
Where if you sort of have a version two of Neuralink you can just sort of like leave the version one in there and I guess just let it sit there dormant and then install the version two.																									
I'm wondering what the like upper bound is for like version updates in that manner at some point to sort of lock the pathways that you need to accurately detect like neural activity or is this something that can be done essentially like indefinitely.																									
The other comment that I had was is it possible if the goal is merely to move a cursor around a computer and click so very just like minimally viable output to a computer.																									
Could one conceive of instead of installing a Neuralink or a stent road type device in your brain could you use some other points in the nervous system like your fingertip or your your arms and just have less long term like																									
upgrade ability risk to sort of like monkey with your brain and then the other idea that I had was you know we're talking about use cases.																									
I wonder to what extent this technology could be used in the following way like imagine a patient who is on life support.																									
They're on a ventilator they're intubated however they still are not brain dead.																									
I wonder if you know being hooked up to a Neuralink and being able to use the internet is like preferable to death.																									
And you can take this one step further where you know maybe one day we have you know extra corporal brain life support like a brain bag and you know maybe after you sort of live your corporal life you kind of just get thrown into the brain bag																									
and then with Neuralink you can kind of live a productive second life kind of connected to the computer or about lockdown so essentially we are just essentially brain bags connected to our computers contributing a lot to society anyway.																									
I was curious what everyone thought of those ideas.																									
I think one of the important keys that as far as I understand when people try to develop these quotation mind control technologies what they're trying to do is improve speed of action.																									
And I think that if you like you said I'm moving the cursor just by thinking can we use some other parts of the body.																									
I think that if you you probably can but you want to go straight to the source of the information so you can make it as quick as quick as possible.																									
And I think that if we have a good interface moving the cursor and you compare the speed or the velocity that it takes or time that it takes for you to move the cursor just by thinking or by thinking																									
and then using your hand I think that just thinking that you're moving the course cursor without or bypassing your limbs is probably going to be much quicker.																									
And I think that this is probably the main goal of this technology.																									
It's going to be used for tasks that require quick response and precise response and and if you think about your hand if you get your brain to get a small object.																									
Obviously you will be somewhat precise but like I was mentioned before you're not going to be as precise as a robot for example.																									
That's why Neuralink is developing these robots that are very precise for implementing these devices in one's brain.																									
So I think that that's the goal and I think they're trying to do it some other way would be sort of futile and it would defeat the purpose.																									
Now coming to the last point of your question.																									
And he had a stroke never had any never knew that he had any risk factors and he had a stroke in a part of the brain called the brain stem in a transition between a part called the midbrain and the pons and that's a part where all the connections that go to your brain and come out of your brain travel through.																									
So there was a as if someone cuts with a knife that parts that communicates your brain to your body and this guy had what we call and you probably heard about this before what we call locked in syndrome.																									
So he could only move his eyes up and down and blink and that was all he could do.																									
And this is a very clever person who's a surgeon highly active and very fit.																									
So if you if you ask me 10 years ago what would you offer this patient I would say look this is there's no quality of life there.																									
I think we should probably just offer comfort measures and let him die let nature takes its course.																									
But now I am at a point where I still don't have I still don't think we have a solution for the problem.																									
But when I was discussing this with the patient and with the family I was thinking should I offer these guys to keep him alive for five years hoping that Neuralink or whatever is available is going to help this guy in the future.																									
Or should he just pay the penalty for not being born in the right time in the same place and let him die knowing that at any time we can have a technology that will be very helpful for him.																									
And at the end of the day the guy was a very proud surgeon and he decided with his family that he wanted to die and we actually let him die.																									
But what a waste of brain tissue letting someone die just because they have no communication to their bodies knowing that their minds are intact and they're cognitively they're fine.																									
Please help us Mika. So I understand the point that maybe a brain interface has higher throughputs and would be more performance than something that would replicate the signal of moving your hand moving your limb.																									
But isn't that what we have now. I mean like when you type on a keyboard those are essentially that's neural activity that's being fired through your arm.																									
So if the goal is not to create like the super interface if the goal is just to have a quality of life that's commensurate with that is a lot better than dying.																									
That is you know closer to what we have now. I mean like with that that's risky in terms of what if you're able to extract or having the unintended consequences of putting something in your brain.																									
I mean the downside there is just like if you take your arm or something in the worst case scenario rather than you have to be left with a lot of features.																									
I suspect that if we can actually interface directly with our brain it's not just going to be an incremental optimization from just typing on a phone.																									
I think there's going to be opportunities to evolve language potentially even anticipate someone who's trying to communicate a certain thing.																									
It might even potentially lead to helping them string the right words together. I suspect that there's probably some demands from there.																									
This is just again this is just one example of so many stories that we hear every day and we live every day and like the person who was mentioning about their parents before.																									
And look there's always hope that technology will be able but I was thinking also that maybe an interface that might be able to control an exoskeleton that supports this guy's body and at least give him some opportunity to walk around and do minimal things that would make his life a little bit less boring than just sitting or lying in bed and watching Netflix all day long.																									
You can only watch so much Netflix right? Yeah yeah exoskeleton I can think of that but that's the other aspect of it as well.																									
I was going to say this one thing like you guys are all familiar with like how Tesla started with luxury cars trying to you know demonstrate that there was a market for this and then eventually use that to fund and create economies of scale for the Model 3.																									
The folks who are likely to benefit from this like the patient that you described if they can get experience if they can get advantages that clearly you know leapfrog ahead of us and you know that's I think where the tipping point would occur.																									
Where we see them having benefits. They were once paralyzed but now they're communicating and you know being productive in a way that's far more efficient than we currently are.																									
Without Neuralink I think that would be the tipping point that could occur in the coming decade and that could be where others would want to.																									
I think it was called medical tourists I think Michael was talking about earlier but medical tourism. The idea of going around to places where perhaps you can get your own Neuralink implanted that sort of thing.																									
I definitely if you think just think about like hunter gatherers like you know we today like you know I'm sure back then if you were a certain size a certain physique a certain strength that was you know an advantage for survival.																									
Today you know like that's not the case and I can only imagine that how some you know just in general technology and other investments allow for many folks who perhaps were not biologically necessarily the most suited for survival.																									
5,000 years ago today I think you know because of technology because of all these investments we are all part of the sort of modern civilization and I think perhaps Neuralink could do something just as similar by beating the charge with folks who are paralyzed																									
and other types of issues near degenerative issues giving them an edge over the rest of civilization and then causing that to be the tipping point for wanting to pick up these tools as well.																									
I think there's a couple of big things to think about that maybe haven't been mentioned I wasn't here from the very beginning but one of them was I wish I wasn't drawing a blank right now so one of them was connecting your brain to																									
Okay so back in 2012 I opened up a business in San Francisco that was a neurofeedback business alternative therapy and the goal was to use EEG to drive light and sound to goggles that you would wear to LED glasses and headphones.																									
Your brain would be immersed in light and sound patterns that were being driven by your own EEG patterns and the idea here was in my experience with it was that by feeding these signals that your brain was causing changes to back into your brain through your eyes and ears																									
that you might begin to sense your own brain activities and also sense how your thoughts and feelings were becoming brain waves and were then changing the light and sound which was then so basically my hope was at the time that this would allow me to understand to a greater extent																									
basically to become self aware of my brain activity of my brain waves and how my thoughts and feelings were brain waves.																									
And you know I know a lot more now about the brain than I knew back then and there's huge sort of problems with maybe it doesn't help that much to go into it but the basic idea is that maybe with the greater resolution and definition of																									
neurolink if you could send that activity back into your own brain maybe you would have a much higher resolution understanding of your own brain like sort of like the way meditators																									
so there's all these stories about I guess the big story is Siddhartha Gwattama sat underneath the tree just for a very long time and then he realized he was one with the universe and then the Buddha right it's the Buddha story																									
but there's all these stories like well if you become somehow more aware of your thoughts and feelings and you could have transformational growth, you could have happiness, you could have peace, you could have more control over your own choices and you could make better choices and you'd have enlightenment																									
and so like what if we could mass produce enlightenment where people become very in touch with themselves, very self aware and very at peace they find very like imagine think about all the unhappy people in the world																									
well what if you could just create a device okay well hey you're unhappy but there's a way try this device in a short order you'll become enlightened you'll gain great insight into how your mind works and how you're doing the things that are not working for you and how you can do the things that do work for you																									
and that's one thing so the other thing is artificial intelligence so when Neuralink was first discussed two ideas sort of seemed to emerge one was telepathy and one was artificial intelligence																									
telepathy yeah if you can connect your brain signals to a computer and then send them to someone else it's sort of like an artificial telepathy and artificial intelligence is different																									
so I had this dream one time that I was the dream is interesting because it's like one possibility out of a million possibilities you know a lot of different possibilities but in this dream I went into a cafeteria and I sat down and I accepted this chip and the chip was a little AI																									
and I could put it either on my waist or my neck and the idea is that it would tap into my nervous system and begin sending and receiving messages too much to my brain and then I got up out of my body now I was basically in a lucid dream																									
the computer induced the lucid dream the AI was managing my brain so that it looked like I looked at so it looked managing my brain in my body so that it looked as if I was sitting in a cafe in a normal way drinking a cup of coffee and just sitting there																									
but then in the lucid dream that the computer created for me sort of like virtual reality but it's like it's like an induced dream and I was aware it was a dream and I was aware that the computer was creating the dream																									
I got up and walked out of the cafeteria and then I began to play sort of like an augmented reality game where I was in the world but now there was like angels coming out of the sky and they had like axes and swords and medieval weapons and I had to fight them and this was one of the things that I imagined the future would be like in the stream so I just wanted to share that and maybe with AI and VR																									
I'll just teach you a very cool experiment so if you want to be somewhat aware of what your brain activity is like so obviously the brain electrical activity works in frequencies, hurts																									
so one day try if there's a bright light or even I think the best way of doing this is light down outdoors on a sunny day and close your eyes but make sure you focus on your vision and you see like an inverse ripple effects the circles coming from the periphery to the center of your vision and their circle after circle after circle																									
that is the frequency of your occipital lobes or the frequency of discharge of electrical activities from your occipital lobes which is where your vision is controlled																									
and this is one of the ways that people use for starting their meditation just by looking at these circles and trying to disconnect from the outer world and going to their inner world if you do meditation try doing that and you'll see how cool that is																									
so I have a question maybe Jorge or other neurologist neuroscientists might have some insight on this but my understanding is that the current like the demo monkey or whatever the neural link had is essentially using the neural link for like brain output right																									
they were controlling the pawn game or whatever with their mind but their input was still sort of you know their eyes does neural link based on what we know of the current technology have a solution for the input or is the input we're sort of banking on																									
sort of like a prosthetic eye or prosthetic ear technology or is this not relevant is output essentially the is there a reason why output is the only method that is being focused on right now																									
I can answer that so so neural link has read and write capabilities these electrodes that can read your brain can also you can also transmit electrical stimulation through them and so what they're talking about is creating closed loop therapies where you send some stimulus and then you read to see what the stimulus did																									
and then you send some more stimulus and then you read again to see what the stimulus did then you figure out if therapy is helping or not helping that's in a nutshell that's the most simple way to explain a closed loop therapy																									
but yeah but in addition to that there's nothing that stops scientists then who's using a neural link to also use the eyes and ears in addition to the electrical stimulation provided by the device																									
right so that's used for therapy but I'm saying that like if I just wanted to like project an image to my brain without using my eyes or ears is that something that is like certainly that wouldn't be in the category of the therapy right that's																									
the other technology now the other consumer technology now I know that's that's that's how that's when you start using psychedelic drugs because this is projecting an image into your brain is not that that's simple the pathway is so complex that having a structure																									
that's by not using your vision is going to be able to stimulate different so many different parts of your brain to trigger that image is I think sorry never say never but I think it's virtually impossible it would have to be something																									
super sophisticated and and unbelievably complex but I think yeah that's that's when psychedelic drugs can can help you with that and there are lots of places and studies that are showing that you can do this in controlled environment																									
very safely and the experience that people get our mind blowing and they help for number of medical conditions and even just to improve your performance improve your your levels of energy and healthy people are doing it because it																									
works but that's not a solution to the brain the computer interface really we're trying to the computer is trying to project no it's never but I that's what I'm saying I don't think we have that sort of solution but would that just sort of be then an artificial eye that is like you just plug your																									
eye into a computer and it's just sort of projects the image through your eye pathway or maybe an artificial year is easier to create I guess we have these intercontinental plants already but so I so I have reasons to disagree																									
if I can share so so I mean look if you consider David Egelman's work he he you know and in the work that he talks about done by others they they you know for example I brought this up earlier that they can plug a camera into an																									
electrode strip that they can put on your back of your tongue and then your brain can work out with the images they can also take an eyeball out of a rat and plug it into the audio cortex of the rat and your brain and their the rats brain can begin to see that way																									
so what that tells us is that it is possible to make the brain see through through electrical stimulation whether you're stimulating the brain or stimulating the skin or stimulating the tongue it's possible to make the brain see things in addition our TMS																									
expert left but but you know she said she had also experienced that if you stimulate the brain sometimes if you stimulate the brain with TMS people see a light that's not there all of this points to the fact that with them with brain stimulation it is possible to make people see things																									
but I don't know if I okay I'll pause well I was going to follow up with what Jorge was saying about psychotropic drugs or psychedelic drugs my understanding of how LSD is actually affects the brain is similar to synesthesia																									
right where I believe that's the right term where it's essentially remapping the neural connections between the different senses and that's why people see they'll taste color or they will feel sound or something like that																									
their neural pathways are basically not interchangeable but can be remapped inside the brain and to your point Mika about having the sort of interoperability between the different sensory inputs I think that's I think there is a lot of research to still be done to really understand the availability of these																									
neural pathways but I think that to sort of answer KKG's question I think there is a good opportunity to reimagine the input interface and how it correlates to the how neural link actually provides the output to control a separate function																									
like if you can imagine maybe if the visual recovery isn't available maybe there's a sensory one maybe there's a hearing one where you can actually control the neural link using some other sort of sensory function rather than simply relying on a single one																									
sorry guys I'll just quickly I have to leave it was great talking to you and I hope we can catch up some other time thank you																									
great conversation already thank you very much for your participation																									
I think I need to go to bed so I'm going to head out too thank you goodnight																									
thanks again Mika again it was great great to hear your perspective on everything thanks you so much																									
yeah guys it's been really great I think it's uh
