My driving questions
Short Circuit was a movie about a conscious sentient robot that the government was really super interested in. There were a lot of movies, tv shows, and cartoons that I remember from the 1980s that featured talking robots, talking cars, talking cats, talking aliens. I think they asked a lot of people to consider the idea that intelligent people could exist in many forms beyond humans. 

When I was 16 in highschool I tried LSD for the first time, and that really deepened my curiosity about how the human mind worked. My life was changed by my first LSD experience. I became determined to understand how the mind worked.

I had several more psychedelic experiences over the years, many of which I have written down, so that I can share them someday with a broader audience, which helped expand my curiosity about what consciousness was.

By the time I got to the book On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins in 2005 I was running with the idea that consciousness had to be some sort of temporally active sequence of spatial patterns, as if the Matrix film in 1999 was actually about your brain being a computer that simulated reality.

By the time I learned about 3D Semantic Segmentation in Or Litani’s talk “Deep Learning for “Exotic” Data Like 3D Meshes and Point-Clouds January 31, 2019”
 I had the idea that the illusion referred to by Daniel Dennet, later referred to as a hallucination by Anil Seth, was actually a computational rendering, a concept I learned about studying the work of Jules Urbach from Otoy because Otoy has done pioneering work in capture, rendering, and streaming, with their most visible product being Octane Render.

Now I can see that with NerF Neural Radiance Fields the same idea is occurring to many more people, this idea that neural networks can render computer graphics means that the neural networks in our brains could be rendering computer graphics.

With 3D Semantic Segmentation I was able to wrap my mind around an idea of how a neural network might distinguish objects from a point cloud

Once when I did a psychedelic drug called Salvia Divinorum I experienced a loss of my ability to distinguish objects, and so the entire room melded together, this also happened during my LSD experience while in EEG with Mind Workstation where the universe blended together in a single concept and I experienced the beginning of time as a fractal ever present now moment, as if we are here now always at the very beginning of time.

But there has to be a neurological process for someone to be able to make a distinction between one object and another and that is partially illustrated in cases where someone who is blind, for a long time, is able to see again after some medical procedure restores their sight. One such patient described seeing blackholes for a long time that his mind eventually resolved as windows, I think I read this in the book Action to Perception

So with 3D Semantic Segmentation and Pointnet++ that I began to learn about in 2019 I began to construct in my mind a model of how the brain might, with coincidence detection notice when two features in space had some proximal relationship either spatially, temporally, or via some analogy. Two points in close spatial proximity might be detected by a 3D semantic Segmentation neural network such as pointnet++ and then an association between those two points might mean they were part of the same object. That is a very crude description of how object detection might progress. 3D semantic segmentation goes a step further, if we can say that all these points, or all these colors, or all these features like edges, lines, surfaces belong to one object, can we then classify that object by analogy to some other abstraction such as the word car, or the phrase car window. How often does the phrase open car window occur with all those points lines edges surfaces making up some particular object that has been detected? Connecting phrases and object detection is the world of 3D semantic segmentation, and if an artificial neural network can do then so can a human brain, or an animal brain.

So I had this idea then, since 1999, that the brain could infer from sensory information what objects are, like a neural network connecting the dots into objects and connecting objects to words and forming concepts that essentially map learned objects, and the learned features of objects to learned words and verbal concepts.

But then came some medical mysteries such as what was the data format in the brain, how was data stored, where was it stored, how was it retrieved, how were memories captured, activated, made conscious, and my notes contain answers to these really hard questions, but the answers are based on studying all the work I could find by leading scholars, physicists, neuroscientists, mathematicians, computer scientists going back centuries & millennia.
