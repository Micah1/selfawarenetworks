   13: Space around atoms expands spatially because all particles have to oscillate, and the increasing time means greater oscillation travel times for particles (relative to or compared to travel times for particles at the center of a mass where the frequency or density of mass is higher) The way this is represented in a per interval moment of spacetime is with the relative appearance of expanded space, but expanded space is spacetime that has a greater oscillatory interval.
   14  

   16  
   17: The center of mass is like the top of the pendulum, it has the highest frequency which is also the highest mass density, and because it's frequency interval is higher it is like extra spatial surface area that is hidden in time dimensions, essentially a time crystal.
   18  

   27  
   28: Space appears to consist of a harmonic oscillating field of particles that can be classified as either energy or mass depending on their frequency or speed.
   29  

   31  
   32:  frequency and ~~amplitude~~ magnitude in the human brain have a 1/f relationship, as ~~amplitude~~ magnitude increases frequency decreases and visa versa.

   50: Suppose that Spacetime as whole is a wave with a frequency pattern.
   51  

   61  
   62: In a fractal cosmos it would make intuitive or visual sense for the relationship of particles to oscillate between a location existence in vortices ie atoms & galaxies, and a frequency interval that is 'an expand spacetime void' relative to the combined density of the oscillator.
   63  

   65  
   66: The expansion of the spacetime voice adds a new interval of scale dependent time (time gets more intervals in space vs on earth, so the clock interates faster the further it is from a dense mass. Yet the higher frequency or density of mass creates an invisible surface area in time that tips the odds of particle travel.
   67  

   77  
   78: The center of mass is where the intervals of time are slowed down, but around a particle time is sped up, so what that particle emits is going to create the quantum gradient time dilation effect of increasing the odds of particle movement in the direction of any other nearby particle. If particles have a compatible oscillatory frequency they will clump together, because their quantum gravity time crystal dilation effect allowed a clustering to happen, an an atom forms, then a molecule.
   79  

   87  
   88: The frequency of mass in a volume, or the density of atoms in a space, produce the 3D volumetric spacetime field as we know & experience it. What I suppose is that the spacetime field & mass alternate in existence, taking turns with one being spacetime energy while the other is a mass, or a vortice in spacetime, like a never ending pendulum, when one vortex (atom) breaks a part, the energy that is released causes another to exist somewhere else, in a never ending cycle.
   89  

  107  
  108: Perhaps its about the conceptual probability of a universe existing being split between two undecidable states: 1 existing somewhere like mass or 2 being a frequency like energy, that is defined as an interval between two points in spacetime that it takes for something with an oscillation or spin to travel.

  151  # The Tonic Mind
  152: Most of the tonic brainwave activity is detectable with EEG sensors. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, (and also low Gamma 30-50hz). My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequences can spike much higher.

   83: imagine the rest of space is also a computed phase field that is relative to the minds computed phase field but it does not have the same dense spatial frequency configuration that the brain has that allows for sophisticated systems like short term and long term memory, just like how a leaf does not do the same thing as a cpu you or a gpu

   8: as if different power bands might be related to different clock speeds of tonic oscillation patterns based on the time of flight of light or sound in the receptive field of each of the sensory modalities resulting in different bandwidth needs, implying that frequency is the bandwidth of some sort of information transfer which I believe is four dimensional grids of multi-sensory multi-data type multi-frequency representation

  4: What if our brain's ability to more accurately control devices that read brainwaves are influenced by the feedback we receive through our senses. That is to say what if there is a certain sound frequency or visual patterns that act as a feedback to say we've given the correct signals to the EEG (?) that our brainwaves are on the right track?

   9: the low frequency high amp power bands might concentrate or focus energy, attract electrons, stabilize and converge powerbands, merge small oscillators, maintain borders between some large oscillators, tempo-spatially synchronize frequency information across modalities, allow voting on correct representations to dominate and correct incorrect representations, or to absorb changes to representations in the brains models.

  25: but changes in dendritic spines that reduce or increase active potassium receptors may have the biggest effect on short term memory as the neurons spike is going to close sooner or later, resulting in higher frequency, low amplitude, small novel sequence firing, faster phasic spikes (information broadcasting) or low frequency, high amplitude, group guassian firing, slower tonic spikes (information observation).

  11: but many of the incoming sensory paths are in the alpha powerband frequency range, so maybe alpha, beta, and gamma frequences can be considered phasic
  12  

  16  
  17: I'm not sure this is right or a useful way to look at things because in a sense the consistent repetition of any frequency range would be considered tonic, and changes or differences in the phase could be either inhibited or phasic or high phasic, and those difference levels signal a degree of difference that helps shape both unconscious mental patterns and conscious mental qualia

  439: If I build a wax cylinder audio recording device I have decided to model the vibrating air molecules with a groove cut into the wax. The audio frequency response of the system is limited by the physics of the diaphragm and needle that is cutting a grove into the wax. I select the hardware in this system to give it the frequency response I need for the application (human hearing range). The grove in the wax is a model.
  440  

  444  
  445: If I digitize the vibrating electrical signals from the microphone into a stream of bits, and store those bits on a flash memory card, the electrical charge patterns on the flash drive is not my model of the vibrating air. As the engineer, I choose the sampling rate of the A/D converter and the simple frequency which sets the dynamic range and frequency response of the model. These are all parameters of the model I select as the engineer of the system. The fact that I decided to use a digital format that had fixed rate sampling and linear encoding of the samples at 16 bits in stereo, are all parts of my model. I could have selected 8 bit using A-law algorithm for dynamic range compression instead of linear.

  19: This interesting visual of an AI attempting to correlate changes in the brain state at a macro level with speech processing in an artificial neural network. The visual correlation they created in the above link I think provokes the idea of sensory data traveling in waves anywhere & everywhere, distinguished from other sensory criteria by the frequency or part of the powerband spectrum, which is why heat is distinct from vibration and that is distinct from sound, and that is distinct from light, and yet all these different frequency range patterns in the em spectrum can be correlated into a unified or entified pattern or rendering for the conscious person to experience because they have common spatial & temporal occurances across the 3D grid of the human brain & body.

  17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations
  18  

  42  
  43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.

  206: perhaps spacetime might oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like the maximum magnitude of spacetime volume like the heat death of the cosmos, and maximum frequency of mass (density per volumetric area) like the big crunch, but I suspect it spacetime never gets to either extreme and is perpetually & infinitely oscillating alternatively between both states in different areas, when one area is getting crunched another area of spacetime of being expanded by the inverse amount.
  207  

  211  
  212: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between mass frequency (density & volume of mass) and spacetime energy magnitude, and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  213  
  214: In neuroscience the freq amp relation is called the 1/f frequency.
  215  
  216: but since high frequency signals travel across oscillators, in a long enough timeline everyone eventually intuits everyone elses secrets
  217  

  258  
  259: the expansion of space time is like amplification of space through the slowing frequency of time
  260  
  261: the density of mass is like the contraction of space through the increase in time frequency

  21: The higher frequency phasic firing neurons then inscribe the contents of the mind, that the mind is aware of, they formulate from everything you see, taste, hear, smell, touch, they are the words in your mind, the songs in your soul, the hallucinations of people touching you when no one is around after a night of drinking Absinthe.

  38  # "Calcium-activated non-selective cation currents are involved in generation of tonic and bursting activity in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta"
  39: "Nigral dopamine neurons are transiently activated by high frequency glutamatergic inputs relaying reward-predicting sensory information. The tonic firing pattern of dopamine cells responds to these inputs with a transient burst of spikes that requires NMDA receptors. Here, we show that NMDA receptor activation further excites the cell by recruiting a calcium-activated non-selective cation current (ICAN) capable of generating a plateau potential."
  40  "An animal's behaviour is altered by the temporal pattern of DA release, and it has been proposed that tonic dopamine levels provide a general motivating function while phasic DA permits the corticostriatal plasticity necessary for habit learning (Reynolds & Wickens, 2000; Wise, 2004; Niv et al. 2007)."

  53  "NMDA caused a switch from tonic to burst firing
  54: A, NMDA (15 μm, in the bath) caused the tonic firing and stable resting potential from time point i to depolarize and switch to high-frequency burst firing with regenerative oscillations of membrane potential (mean: 0.3 Hz ± 0.02, n = 88) by time point ii. Lower trace: DC injection was slowly ramped to −100 pA in order to hyperpolarize the cell and induce stronger oscillations starting at time point ii. B, ISI histograms of firing activity for a representative DA neuron. Tonic spiking had a unimodal distribution of ISIs at 250 ms (CV = 0.15). C, NMDA caused strong bursting with a bimodal ISI distribution, with peaks at 150 ms (ISI within a burst) and 2100 ms (ISI between bursts)."

  13: so the neuron is physically capable of learning a vast number of representations that sculpt its action potential into a frequency pattern that represents so something like an instance of a modality for one frame of consciousness, you would need many such hertz firings perhaps to represent a painting, temporal hertz patterns of many spatial hertz to represent that painting over time as you were moving in front of it. The rows of neurons that are collecting the electrically charged ions are doing the physical act of listening the collecting charge is the screen you are watching, the molecular structure is recording to the electric charge and the observer is the tonic oscillator while the words of the mind, and the content of the mind including our sense of space itself arises inside the notebook or canvas of the mind that is a spectral electromagnetic graph, with magnetic and electric dipoles as created by the oscillators interacting and the differential between them and phasic firing neural circuits in multi-level fractal patterns

Our sense of balance and other inner sense as well, and perhaps our sense of our own magnetic dipoles and electric dipoles gives us the sense of not only what we are focused on but what we are imagining, predicting.

  10  <insert dot painting>
  11: To illustrate dots up close, of different colors, representing electrical frequency patterns to the next set of neurons, the next set of neurons are detecting frequency patterns with little drips of neurotransmitters that arrive in sequences over time to pass ions through their receptors, resulting in the occasional build up of charge with a depolarization or action potential event, that indicates a high threshold of a varying magnitude, that itself is dissipated in a multitude of tiny frequencies carried in lipid sacks called vesicles which release neurotransmitters radially across the branches of an exit terminal to the post-synaptic membranes of the dendrites of other neurons as a common class of brain activity to be an example. The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices. Since neurons are in a tonic firing pattern when they are not firing phasically they can also create dark spots, or patterns that appear as

   97: In the real brain, spikes have variable amplitude and frequency, they are soliton waves, they do not collide with other waves and they do not summarize. In the real brain spiking is not an all or nothing event as it is described in comp neuro, and neurons oscillate.

You can consider neurons as dimensionless points, but you can also model the full dendritic tree with ionic current dynamics differentially modulated on each compartment.. You can consider synaptic interactions as current transients, conductance transients, transmitter release probabilities... Etc, etc, etc..

   7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
   8  
   9: In other words my conjecture is that the principle of 1/F in neuroscience is scale invariant and that it applies to everything at all scales. Essentially the universe consists of quantum waves and galactic supercluster sized waves and every wave has the same inverse relationship between ~~amplitude~~ magnitude and frequency
  10  
  11: Amplitude is not always inverse to frequency, nor is duration, but my hypothesis is that magnitude might be inverse to frequency. In the brain at the scale of EEG it appears that amplitude is inverse to frequency, and at the neuron scale it appears that amplitude is fixed but the duration is changing, this led to the idea that magnitude, the combination of amplitude & duration might have an inverse relationship to frequency at all scales of the universe. Including at the neuron action potential scale, and at the brainwave measurement scale. Hypothesis: When amplitude shifts to not have an inverse relationship to frequency the duratio of the wave has also shifted.
  12  

  16  
  17: So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?
  18  

  20  
  21: The idea is that because of the All or nothing principle the duration of the action potential is more precisely inverse to the frequency. 
  22  
  23: So it’s frequency is supposed to change without a change in amplitude, but there is an amplitude change that is being passed through the action potential as a duration of the potential, or the potential's decay time, or the delay in time for how long the action potential is open before it is hyperpolarized, and potentially it sends a message to other neurons by releasing more neurotransmitters but also it collects a receipt of the extra transmission with h
  24  
  25: However if the frequency changes, and the amplitude stays the same then the duration must change, the shape of the waveform must change.
  26  

  28  
  29: So the idea is that when we have high frequency bursts the duration will be lower, and when we have low frequency bursts the duration of each burst will be higher, because there is an inverse relationship between the duration & frequency. 
  30  

  32  
  33: Light peps, or slow slams. This idea would be consistent with physics, that amplitude as duration or time cannot stay the same if frequency is changing.

    81: see I was in a discussion the other day, talking about how the synaptic inputs can increase or decrease the membrane potential, potentially causing an action potential that has a variable amplitude and frequency, that effects the membrane potential of another synapse
    82: in comp neuro, and in many AI models, they simplify so that all action potentials are equal, and they only take into account the frequency of the spike.
    83: but the amplitude of the wave matters, because that impact is going to determine how much the next synapse's membrane potential is going to be effected, which critically is going to effect it's firing frequency and amplitude also.

  14: The chemical properties of dopamine, serotonin, acetyl-choline, and gaba must have temporal effects determining the likely oscillation value for the group oscilation array, which is why gaba neurons tend to oscillate with delta frequences. This makes sense because the combined oscillator force of a lipid sack of neurotransmitters is going to cause a variation of some sort in the frequency experience that is transmitted between neurons. Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron

  37: sparse quantum pattern learning/prediction is probably better for high frequency low amplitude senses, such as olfactory, maybe taste, but taste is also texture which is about high amp high surface area. smell, emotions, and point clouds have a lot less mass and a lot more energy, so quantum signals represent a sparse sample learning spread over a large area

  56: "Different elements of a memory, or any mental event, are encoded in locations distributed across the cortex. A prominent hypothesis proposes that widespread networks are integrated with bursts of synchronized high-frequency oscillations called “ripples,” but evidence is limited. Here, using recordings inside the human brain, we show that ripples occur simultaneously in multiple lobes in both cortical hemispheres and the hippocampus, generally during sleep and waking, and especially during memory recall. Ripples phase-lock local cell firing and phase-synchronize with little decay between locations separated by up to 25 cm, enabling long-distance integration. Indeed, corippling sites have increased correlation of very-high-frequency activity which reflects cell firing. Thus, ripples may help bind information across the cortex in memory and other mental events."

  89: "if a pair of oscillators do not interact and they have a frequency difference, their phase-relation will change continuously with a rate determined by their frequency difference (detuning), a phenomenon termed phase precession.
  90: "Nevertheless, this review demonstrates that changes of a few Hz either between brain locations or a moment-to-moment basis, according to stimulus or cognitive conditions, is a property of neuronal oscillations in many frequency bands. Moreover, the precise oscillation frequency can have profound consequences in terms of synchronization properties (correlation, phase relations). Hence, we argue that manipulations of detuning represent a key experimental target to causally infer oscillatory properties without strongly affecting other network properties. Advanced multi-neuron electrophysiological and optical techniques (optogenetics, cellular voltage imaging) in future studies will provide exciting possibilities to measure and target frequency generation in neural oscillations and synchronization during cognition and behavior."

  113: "neural spikes which are the carriers of information" Yes AI people who have opinions on neuroscience largely think this is so, but I don't agree. What I am saying is just opinion based on actual neuroscience I have read. I think singular neural spikes can represent just noise. While bursting and or higher frequency patterns can represent but one form of information transfer. Most of information transfer in the brain is probably subthreshold (brain-activity that does not cause a neuron to spike) There is probably a lot of chemical activity involved in information transfer that is subthreshold. I view spiking as a sort of retroactive indicator of brain activity, like blood flow it allows us to "read minds" or "plot" the activity of minds, via implanted electrode chips, eeg, meg, or fmri. The spike, I think, it's just a discharge, like a waste product, removing an excess, and like blood flow it's about removing heat, and reducing the inflammation of cells.

  27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.

We find that the surprisingly rapid frequency-dependent broadening of APsyn is enabled by a unique molecular combination of Kv1.1/1.2 channels with the Kvβ1 subunit. Indeed, this small broadening of the APsyn mediated by Kvβ1 has a tremendous impact on synaptic transmission as the loss of the Kvβ1 subunit blocks synaptic facilitation even during paired-pulse stimulation without altering initial vesicle fusion (Figs. 4–6).” https://www.pnas.org/content/117/47/29937

  78: We may need to model the ionotropic brain. That means modeling how calcium and potassium ions, stored in the dendrite soma, are changing amplitude & frequency of the action potential, which changes the synaptic output, ie how many vesicles are activated, and what types of neurotransmitter are released downstream, which further alters the ionotropic balance of dendrites on the receiving end. If one neuron is connected to 200 downstream neurons, when that one neuron fires, with varying strength, varying amounts of vesicle activation, varying quantities and types of neurotransmitters, how are those 200 downstream neurons affected in a different way?

   4: quantum mechanics are involved in every physical interaction, but that does not make it an obvious solution to a "metaphysical mind" as you put it. I think the information that makes up the human experience consists of synchronizing coincidence patterns in the higher phasic gamma frequencies and inhibiting decoherence patterns disrupting the lower frequency tonic firing of the aware mind. Yes this process involves electric-chemical interactions, but the quantum mechanic may be as mechanical in the brain as a drive shaft is in a car, no reason at this point to assume the drive shaft is conscious.

  17: Well on the one hand I am saying that metaphysics is information and information in the brain is tempo-spatial coincidence detection, but on the other hand quantum mechanics may be essential to the brains metaphysical calculation because the phasic disruptive bursting of high frequency gamma waves contrasting with the tonic regularity of lower frequency waves may be a literal metaphysical expression as scattering amplitudes, so if you compare the high hz phasic Gamma with spherical waves, and the low hz tonic with plain waves, you might be able to use something like the amplituhedron to calculate the metaphysic state. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_amplitude

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

  15: Essentially the wave form of the action potential by itself is a frequency with amplitude, but the multi-possible microvesicle release, with options between 0, 1, 2, 3 vesicles being released, depending on the wave form of the action potential, that means that both the amplitude & frequency of the action potential is being transmitted, in a smaller form, across the synapse to other dendrite computers.
  16  
  17: If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.
  18  

  24  
  25: So imagine that a low amplitude high frequency phasic action potential spike transmits both neurotransmitters and a mechanical wave that is received as sodium channels open on the other side of the synapse. The delta (or amount) of the mechanical wave ought to correlate 1:1 with the delta of the synaptic transmission.

   19  

   27  
   28: I realized that a high frequency firing might created a amplitude release of neurotransmitrers which might open lots of potassium channel receptors inhibiting other neurons faster, creating a collective representation in a columized layer, edge community, circuit, or neural array that would be collectively perceived by the next array, and so on, and that the entire bunch of neurons would learn invariant representations,

Cells can detect patterns by firing at a high Gamma frequency ONLY when a specific pattern is recognized via a multiple possible path of near simultaneous presynaptic neuron firings within about 3 milliseconds of one another resulting in the recognition of a pattern via a phasic soliton wave that will cycle through a neural circuit being recognized by other parts of the brain doing pattern recognition.

Each of those sensory moments is correlated in the brain by a group of cells that fire together. If they fire together with some novel frequency they begin to associate with one another, so that when you have a slightly different experience, that is vaguely similar to the experience you had previously a different group of cells fires that may include one of the cells from the other previous group of cells the fired, because one member of the original group of cells fired, it's associated partner cells shift into a ready state, they are now expecting to fire. This is the basis of memory-prediction in the brain. Now it might be that when you have a thought, you are having somewhere between 100 thousand and 100 million memory predictions being triggered in close temporal and spacial proximity. However despite these large complex numbers, the essential mechanism of memory-prediction is the same. Your memory-predictions are your expectations, your beliefs, your bets, your suspicions, and your every thought about everything.

  6: (not my writing) "Inspired by the work of Dr. Len Ochs and Dr. Ruth Olmstead, I (Transparent Corp) came up with this protocol for increasing plasticity in the brain. It is a three part protocol, increasing brainwave frequency for one session, and decreasing for another, similar to the research by Dr. Olmstead for treatment of ADHD/ADD http://www.avstim.com/manuals/olmstead_dissertation.pdf. I further enhanced the sessions by starting at delta and using Dr. Len Och’s technique of stimulating ½ HZ above or below the most dominant brainwave for each of the brainwave groups. These sessions are to be done once a week, not on consecutive days. The third session is a maintenance session based on Dr. Och’s protocol of alternatively stimulating a fraction of a HZ above or below your dominant frequency in 2 minute intervals between a 3- 30 HZ range. A video of him describing this technique and its overwhelming success can be seen at MindPlace’s YouTube site. http://www.youtube.com/themindplace#p/u/17/RMcoB98xKts .

Theta occurs when your conscious mind is disengaged, such as in dreaming sleep, REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and deep meditation or self hypnosis. Many adults only attain the Theta brainwave state in their sleep, and can not seem to reach or sustain the Theta state when they are awake. Interestingly, the planet Earth resonates at a Theta frequency of 7.83 Hz, a frequency known as Schumann Resonances.

If we only produce delta we will find us in dreamless deep sleep, but we also see delta in various combinations with other brainwaves. They may then represent intuition, curiosity, a kind of radar, hunches or a "feeling" for situations and other people. Delta is often seen with people who work in therapeutic environments or professions and with people who have had traumatic experiences and have developed a "radar" for difficult situations.

And then you can also just listen to like frequencies like the you can look up like this whole fagot frequency like three six nine. And but anyway, the point is that you can find like this. If you look at brain, if you look at binarial beads, you can find like gamma frequencies or delta frequencies.
   81  

   85  11:34
   86: Like, you know, people who have like depression, they have a lot of they've a lot more predominance of data, the slower frequencies and data and delta frequencies which which I think correlates with my idea that that for some people depression is a metabolic disorder. They're not producing enough energy, not enough ATP and so they're not able to maintain those higher frequency states that that the neurotypical has when they go back their daily life.
   87  

   97  12:47
   98: And it ends again, you don't need headphones for the like the just the tones, like the sulfur frequency 369, and so and so forth, like you can listen to the yeah, I think myself.
   99  

  325  40:16
  326: And, and then, and the inner is, like, yeah. So I mean, it's it's, it's they, they're there are the thing. It's like like so the gavin neurons for example, like they the there's they're like in certain brain areas like the like the thalamus and they ought they have in what comes out of them is our brain waves that are in the delta frequency range and that's very interesting.
  327  
  328  40:53
  329: It's like, okay, so we have a certain kind of neurotransmitter in a certain area and the outcome is a certain part of the brainwave frequency, from all the things are correlated. And if you look at like, you know, a lot of the incoming senses from when you go from the eyes, you know, to, to the into the, to the visual cortex in the visual cortex, right?

  123: But also, they are beating up space time because heating up space is the same as speeding up space time. And so the, but then some of space time is also slowed down because inhibited, so it's frequency is slower, but it's at the same time, it's amplitude is higher so it's a habitated inhibited but it takes up a lot of space.
  124  

  185  28:46
  186: The volume of energy time of energy is inverted to the speed of mass. Does that make sense? Yes, yes it does. Yes. It is. Because what I'm saying is like the idea of math is that mass is much more slower and frequency. So the volume of energy is inverted to the speed of mass, the slowness of mass is inverted to this.
  187  

  236  36:55
  237: So the faith. So two particles that represent that represent opposites opposite charges of the same space. Same frequency, same frequency, but opposite charges, right? Positive space and negative space. And when they combine, they become a neutron because that makes sense because it's like, you have two, two particles that combine and they be in the enter a different face state, so they become a different particle.
  238  

  284  45:35
  285: So a particles are frequency, which is in the frequency is like
  286  
  287  45:47
  288: It's like frequency and distance. All right, so space and time are
  289  
  290  46:01
  291: Frequency and distance.
  292  
  293  46:06
  294: Oh shit, space and time are frequency and distance. So essentially what I'm saying is like the distance as is a space frequency, distance is a space frequency, share? Okay, it's a frequency and and which spaces more slow. And slowness is distance and and, and it's called. But but where space is more dense.
  295  

  302  48:25
  303: Entropy is like participation of mass into energy and which is like. So participation entrepreneur. Does that make sense and to this energy? So the universities either mouse or energy but the universe is really like, either mass or frequency or the universe versus either distance, or frequency, or the universe is either amplitude or frequency like this distance and amplitude.
  304  

  548  01:20:29
  549: He can lower frequency and mass increase.
  550  
  551  01:20:41
  552: Actually, the diversion of frequency and and amplitude. So masses, the amplitude relative to the frequency of energy.
  553  
  554  01:20:58
  555: Is it masses? The amputee. That's inverted to the frequency of energy because mouses energy moving out more stories and masses. So mass is the energy.
  556  
  557  01:21:19
  558: By dancing with energy for they to the frequency of

  562  

  785  02:10:39

  787  

b0055y.md:
   35  05:40
   36: It's kind of like these are they're different phases, different phase patterns, different phase speeds. It's really the different phase velocities, right? That's the difference between I would say this, that's why a neutron and a positron. And and I try and do not merge. It's because they have different a different frequency patterns and and they have different amplitudes.
   37  

   53  07:38
   54: It's frequency increases, then it's going to be smaller and faster, but it's going to be smaller and faster and
   55  

   98  13:33
   99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
  100  
  101  14:10
  102: Or as I say increases with increasing mass or decreases with, and increasing frequency,
  103

  36  04:45
  37: So you have more that you can go to the from the parameter cells to the intern neurons, to the thalamus and get to the thalamatic radios. Things through about like the delta frequency, right? It's a much slower frequency. The top of the court six layer and it moves more slowly.
  38  
  39  05:12
  40: It's lower frequency, higher amplitude. And I think of it, as more of the observer of macroscale patterns time, and then I think a
  41  

  45  05:56
  46: So but it's interesting that there are gamma whereas there's so there's like a low 40 hertz camera and the Delta frequency rates it shows up. It's very interesting that it doesn't. So, but I would say that I would suspect that the the high frequency
  47  

  51  07:04
  52: But just a hypothesis it's gonna be like this rate is like the frequency gets reduced over time, but the amplitude grows up and that means that the the sixth layer is like the observer. And are they like the? It's like the that's where the it's like it's like when you look around the world imagine you're kind of like looking inside your skull a little bit.
  53  

b0064y.md:
  43  06:22
  44: They're being made at in the Delta frequency across the layer. Six of the so it's like decisions. High level decisions are gonna be made made across the entire top of the brain which is the slower moving part of the grand district or in that that's part of it like this.
  45  

b0065y.md:
  24  02:26
  25: And and so this allows to have this allows for patterns to have varying levels of frequency, right? And, and so sense.
  26  

  48  05:46
  49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
  50  

  54  06:49
  55: And and of course other you know, that's in the sensory input areas. But the later on your reality is in the delta pattern and a data and in somewhere else hasn't the data pattern and and and, and, and it's in it, it's really in the contrast between the basic firing patterns and the, the resonating contrast because patterns resonate and the alpha frequency and the beta, frequency, the data, and the gamma frequency, but the amount of possible, right?
  56  

  60  07:41
  61: It's really a lot slower than sensory and potato but it's but it's, it's bigger picture. It's it's a higher amplitude. So it's it's more network. It's when the network comes together, the highest levels and the Delta frequency.
  62  
  63  08:06
  64: But yeah, so but think of your reality. Like when you look around, like, when you walk outside Mercedes, you're inside the opera frequency. Innocence you're being your video perspective. On reality has been rendered inside the alpha pregnancy and the lower reasons of your cortex, the visual stuff in the visual reports, the auditory stuff, and there's an audio cortex or auditory cortex.
  65  

b0067y.md:
   42  and then it sends some of it onward, or it's stopped from sending a normal signal.
   43: So the key is that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast, and that's their (high magnitude low frequency) synchronization, right? Like the alpha frequency rate and disruption is to that are things that are events that all of the cells are going to notice.
   44  

  263  
  264: *That inspires our minds to imagine that an anti-gravity propulsion technology could be accomplished with an oscillation pattern is a splay state (relatively opposite in the timing of it's oscillatory intervals) to the oscillation frequency of gravity (the Quantum Gradient Time Dilation). 
  265  

  327  
  328: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  329  
  330: This triggers some ideas for amplifying the human sense of smell, by considering how the shape of a dog's olfactory bulb, and the rates & types of its signal pathways are different from the human nose. I imagine that the sense of smell might be heavily influenced by the frequency of the whole brain and that people who use caffiene to stay in a beta brainwave state might have their sense of smell deteriorate more over time compared to people who meditate deeply & do yoga.

  101: It's that by the, it's different, it's it different in the face field, right? So color is a different frequency, but the frequency is to your brain, is just a difference, relative to everything else. And so, your brain has this sort of like, mental map of functions that are sort of, sort of rendering color based upon the comparison of contrasts and a phase field, right?

  91: What's happening is a lot of charges is, is building up now. So these. So, if these neurotransmitters, if they arrive faster, okay? Then they're going to start to, but put in a lot of energy really fast, right? Because they're transmitted, they're sending energy faster, but if they arrive slower, what's going to happen is, they're this because there's a one F relationship between amplitude and frequency in the brain.
  92  
  93  23:07
  94: What's going to happen is that these neurotransmitters are going to, they're going to basically a, you're gonna get, you're gonna get a high amplitude, low frequency burst, which is going to, which is going to, which is going to

I want to do next or some sort of rule. It's an absence follow as far as what they do if they receive different types of signals.
   64  

  101  13:42
  102: Basically like a pattern that leaves to a state or else. So what I'm saying is that LTD and LTP are both accomplished with also Tory signals, and also it's for a signal, the oscillatory. Coupling and decoupling is basically like accomplished either through the mutual stimulation, or Hey, and also Tori is placed a which accomplishes like a stimulation frequency pattern and which is weird.

Is it is a, you know, zero is it was, it is its magnitude, like a zero, one two or three, because it's frequency like the zero one, two, three, like, you know, there's inverse relationship between frequency and magnitude, right?
  10  01:23
  11: So higher frequency means lower magnitude, and so, all I need. So it needs to sound basically to each one of the neurons. And a second terminal, basically the same message which is, you know, I want to two or three event fired and so here's a bunch of neurotransmitters or no neurotransmitters.

The face frequency emerging from net from cortical columns and oscillators groups of neurons.
   32  05:41

   92  20:12
   93: And, and the rush of potassium opening would would either inhibit the cell or it would cause cell to shorten the action potential, right? And if you have at the at the frequency of of the action potential is shorter than the amplitude of its radius is going to be larger think because there's a there's a there's an inverse relationship so if the if the frequency is smaller the amplitude is larger if the amplitude is smaller, the frequencies longer or larger.
   94  20:58
   95: Yeah. So that would be like a longer frequency or larger frequency. I'm not sure how to how higher for, it's a higher frequenc. I think. Yeah, higher frequency. Yeah, so we're talking like hurts. So if if we're sending out so their height, so the gamma camera bursts, you know the frequencies of gamma ray of gamma vert of sorry, the gamma frequency of brainwaves because the brain can oscillate between like, 0.02 Hertz and 600 Hertz, and the high gamma burst to faceobok burst, those are high frequency births so tent.
   96  21:39
   97: Tonic oscillations are low frequency verse. And I'd in the idea is that to understand the oscillation the oscillations tend to, like get divided into power bands. That are they maintain a distance between themselves of like 2.17? And, and it can differ a little bit between different animal species. How exactly what?
   98  22:09

  102  23:18
  103: Maybe even like high frequency, it would be gamma. That's what I imagine that. You gonna have a little bit more of that, I have to check. And then the the towards the, you know, the top, the at the pyramidal cell level actually, when you get into, you know, I would expect to have more delta up there and because
  104  23:53
  105: And because well, when you get into, because the, when you get to the thought bridges, you know, the the thalamus is like this, this Delta firing circuit, right? And it is got it's it's sort of like you want to be in the same frequency range for data data data comparability, I think like, and I think you need, I think if if we one offslider is going to be able to receive and interpret the signals of another oscillator, I think you want some sort of like frequency matching in terms of the rate of information for it just for so that there's an apples.
  106  24:43

  228  53:33
  229: In the third layer, it's going to be activated by the, by the coincidences that are below it and so it can detect. So because it's like a sparse pattern detector, right? It's looking for, really just like connections between two points that is paying attention to within within a certain frequency range, right?
  230  53:58

  290  01:09:49
  291: But it's creating it's it's it's creating a high amplitude but low, frequency a depression, a low frequency,
  292  01:10:06
  293: Say LTD is long-term, potentiation, and LCD is long-term, depression. It's creating a low frequency depression, but the whole oscillator is tracking that in terms of the depression depression. So, the global oscillation would still like increase.
  294  01:10:35

  318  01:15:54
  319: Okay. So, but what is interesting, is that, you know, in experiments with, you know, like low frequency trains. So so they use high frequency to to high frequency stimulation to evoke long-term potentiation, right to evoke action. Potentials which have that's when you are going to have more spikes, more, high frequency spikes and it's going to create inhibitions I guess as a reaction to those bikes.
  320  01:16:34
  321: But when you feed the brain, a lot of low frequency trains like of electrical simulation like one hurts that that might inhibit basically inhibit short-term memories. In the sense that the low frequency is going to trigger higher amplitude, low frequency,
  322  01:17:01
  323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
  324  01:17:34
  325: So the inhibition process and so, so going back to with the inhibition process. That comes as a result of the the action potential is going to magnify sort of like matte. It's going to innocence magnify the impact of the action potential on the oscillator, but it's an in between step between the action potential, which is it, which is a high phase, high frequency activity to the oscillation, which is a low oscillations, can be low frequency activity and the in between step, is that a set of neurons are inhibited the set of neurons that were a set of neurons that were connected that were connected to the firing order on that were inhibited to this.
  326  01:18:33

  328  01:18:40
  329: Okay. But yeah, I mean recent researchers like really have done have better. Have studied LTP and LL DP as like basically, you know, the high amplitude, low frequency LTD signals, basically, stimulating the brain with like, a one herbs frequency, that is going to de-synchronize groups of neurons. That is going to not be synchronized.

So the electric and the magnetic to frequency spectrum is literally and then the the MRI is tracking blood flow, which is that in the blood flow is a is a another part of the, you know, when they're on fire blood, what gets called blood flows, where attention goes blood flaps are there the phrases blood

You can just imagine like a good like a whole world of molecules that are all oscillating at the same frequency that they're combined to fat is going to create like a thick lane of and I say they claim because like okay so like an atom is like a it's like a piece of space that has has been crunched together pulled together.

I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)

(it doesn't have to be an audibe tone, because it's in the context of information theory it's an information pattern because of the rarity of its distinctive signal relative to the tonic signals nearby. So it creates contrast in the mind of the brain that the organism's collection of cells is perceiving at multiple scales)

   29: So, their information is contained because they are distinct. Distinct tempo. Spatial frequency characteristics. As if the four dimensional temple, spatial frequency is being transmitted.

  119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.
  120  
  121  19:28
  122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

   12  02:57
   13: But, and oscillation frequency allows the, the oscillation frequency is seen when you have, let's say that the gamma frequency is defined by the decay rate of the, of the inhibition of signal or the LTD signal and so you have. But you have with the camera, you have this sort of like linking or association or binding of different gamma patterns or cross multiple reasons of the brain that happened had some sort of coincidental pattern in temp and time or space or stale, or break or frequency.
   14  03:47

  128  33:44
  129: And you can make an argument that the physicists, the high frequency physicverse are decaying oscillators. They're not meant to repeat indefinitely. They're meant to decay and, and the decay is in part part of how the the rest of the oscillator gets to learn a pattern but also be prepared for new patterns.

  37: So it creates such so it creates. So you can have a really unique sounding tone. And in terms of like, how many receptors, how many sodium receptors, how many calcium receptors are active, how many potassium receptors are active? Because it's going to change, like the amp amplitude and frequency of the firing of the end, the fate and the phase characteristics.
  38  07:13
  39: Well, the phase characteristics are going to be like really amplitude and frequency which are in which are inverted. And in terms of like their proportions, so greater amplitude means less frequency greater frequency means, less amplitude, right? And this happens at multiple scale, so you have like this multi-scale temple, spatial phase space at the brain creates and the brain to text.

   17: Lets talk about the value of trying to convey meaning, through tonic repetitions contrasted with higher frequency deviations. Like trying to create waves of meaning with songs or hymns or verses like repetitive tones versus surprising tones, like 5 hmms and 1 hey. The hey is surprising, and information theory that hey has more meaning than the repetative hmms.

   25: In the recording I sound out different tones and I speculate that the beginning of spoken language may have been just differences in tones. (A tone is a frequency pattern that has time & space characteristics). Distinctions in phase patterns are good enough for us to make sense of words, to listen, speak, write, but this is also what our brains process, they detect information as coincidental firing phase sequences (sequences of frequencies over durations).
   26  

   61  
   62: As signals pass through each area, the deviations that are happening (by deviations I mean decoherence patterns deviating from the tonic synchrony in the alpha, beta, theta, or delta frequency power bands) modify our perception of reality in real-time. The deviations in cells especially in the exit from the cortex to the thalamus modify and are modified by the signals from (or going to) the neo cortex, enabling whole brain activity that brings together our history of learned memories with new information from the environment.
   63  

   81  
   82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
   83  
   84: If you have incoming Sensory Signals that were much more sparse, in terms of their area effect, like single spikes instead of big oscillating groups, and these single spikes were distinguished with a much higher frequency (relative to the tonic pace of the oscillating group) then you are beginning to describe the situation in the brain where the oscillating group of cells can detect the novel firing patterns that represent memories, because those neurons that fired reset the pace of the group of neurons that were inhibited by the firing of that one neuron.

  12: And but like what I'm saying is like if power brands like are easily converge and oscillatory, dynamics and electrons are attracted to power bands, then the power bands might be serving as a, the power bands of low frequency. Oscillators like between 0 point to hurts and having 70 parts.
  13  02:58
  14: Like everything that's like below high gamma. So like low gamma and high and all the betas and alpha data and delta like those power bands are perhaps you're like low amplitude neurosurgeon set attract coop cooperation because they're low amplitude. Widespread firing results in neurons, that sort of like send a love frequency.

And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.

And you need to have a certain number of these arriving, was in a certain frequency to, to represent a pattern that has been that, you know, that that the that it means that neuron has detected a certain pattern.

  264: So even if it temporarily changes its frequency because it fired it sooner or later than it normally fires, that's just this temporary pattern but this actually what we want.

  325  01:11:52
  326: This is the event baboon, I don't know if that's right. Maybe that's something I sound but but that is a, that is a different. It's not a tonic frequency, that's a phasic frequency, it's a phasic pattern. It's phase of frequency pattern and so you can say it, we can go into.
  327  01:12:12
  328: Well the brain is consists of temporal and spatial patterns time patterns spatial patterns, and to, and temporal and it'll end and they also can convince. It's also tonic and it's also a sort of like dialectic between tonic and physic firing patterns. All right? So a face of physic firing pattern can happen, which is, you know, it's a different frequency.
  329  01:12:49
  330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
  331  01:13:11

  349  01:17:19
  350: That is very regular and it's a whole bunch of neurons doing it. So it's not really information but then you have phasic firing which is unique and if that's like when the piano when you hear a piano note, that's the phasic firing and that faceobok firing is much, it's much higher for frequency.
  351  01:17:38
  352: That could be like a 200 Hertz, gamma frequency or something. But I'm also arguing that the entire brain from the canvas of consciousness and tonic frequency range to the physic firings and higher frequency ranges. I consist of consists of temples spatial frequencies between 0.02 hertz and as high as 600 hertz.
  353  01:18:04

  375  01:24:01
  376: The right. That is a frequency. It's a frequency and has a spatial characteristic, too. Where is it sound coming from how loud? Is it? How big is the sound? How quiet is a sound? 
  377  
  378  01:24:23
  379: But it has spatial. It has sound, doesn't just have a frequency. It has associated characteristics. Has spatial characteristics. Where's the voice coming from? Does it come from this room? It's coming from the next room. Is it coming from yourself? Is coming from somewhere else? Just spatial characteristics, the sound has.
  380  01:24:44

  436  01:38:33
  437: And but the thing is like, okay. Well, now, what if you see a dog and has the same time, right? So idea, is that not only, you know, so we have these these patterns that. Yeah, the basic patterns is like when phase of pattern flat is when a neuron fires out of at a much higher frequency than the usual tonic frequency.
  438  01:38:59
  439: You get a bunch of neurons and different areas all firing at a time frequency and they all have. And then there's this. Some there's there's some of the internal so they've got neural columns. You've got no micro micro columns. You've got large columns, you've got small, neural circuits or just groups.
  440  01:39:20

  472  01:48:11
  473: It's assault and waves. You can have a lot of different basic patterns happening. There are such they're so high frequency that they're sort of like impacting the slower frequency. Tonic wave oscillations and a big way like like the I think the faster faster frequencies are cause all of the slower frequencies pay attention because then because there is this sort of like, you know, there's this so we oscillators work.
  474  01:48:47

  506  01:56:10
  507: And then there's the actual moment feeling which is when that you've got those pianos are being planned. When you have the big action, potentials firing if higher physic frequencies. This is the thing that happened right now, that's the highest frequency before we land. The neurons are like listening, seems like multiple scales of data collection from from synapses to dendrites, to the summer, to be that to the activity output of an entire neural column to to an intern neuron that travels between neural columns like a long distance, internal that receives that that basically allows patterns to travel from one region of another so that you can connect incoming audio data temporarily with incoming visual data.

There's this idea that wait a second, the oscillation itself. How could it represent? Complex information. It's all the same that you have, like, that's like you all these neurons are that are, how could the frequency, say, the group of neurons?
  30  

  40  
  41: Out of its normal oscillatory, frequency the rest of the oscillation resets it. So there's this whole like that just hold like neurophysics thing where we have to talk about the physics of brain, waves and tendrides and There are transmitters and I think that there's a lot of stuff to mention, but we can kind of get a framework out of it.

  40  07:34

  42  07:48
  43: Sound like a deviate but it is going to sound like an idea in terms of frequency, but it's also going to be in terms of timing and in terms of space, all at the same time, like any change in any one of these is going to result in changing and the others.
  44  08:10
  45: But what kind of macroscale, right? You see, lots of neurons that are making lots of sultan ways each with a number. So it's like each one has a position property right? X y and z, where the x is the frequency. The y is the timing.
  46  08:38
  47: Why is sequence time? So there's a frequency. There's a sequence time.
  48  08:51

  60  11:32
  61: Now, the way, that's the reason I said, waves it, so the action potential has a waveform, right? The shape that determined by an amplitude and duration. So has an amplitude and a derision. Now, it was a second. It has a frequency an altitude duration, the amplitude, but they're all that it's tied together the duration.

  25: That is manifested in terms of like it's either going to. It's either going to have a faster frequency and there's with a smaller scale or it's going to have in slower frequency with a broader impact. And so because there's two possible situations, the firing speed of, the neuron could be excited.
  26  04:04

  30  04:54
  31: It's in between excited. So they're looking for a frequency that's going to allow just going to allow frequency, it's going to allow it to be on the edge of either excitation or in addition
  32  05:24

b0232y ctpr.txt:
  12  01:52
  13: So then you you don't get that first thing effect that you would normally get, what do they mean by a couple? Are they do? They mean that they're oscillating together at the same frequency or is that means the synapses that the activity in the dendrite is enough to cause the solema to burst on and it can go the other way.
  14  02:17

  30  05:54
  31: And that's going to change the amplitude or frequency of the of the action potential. So that's, that's an idea. I don't know what you think about. Yeah. So I like if you change the rest, like, let's say, you, you're injecting a current. And so one, one thing I meant to say earlier that my clarify some things, the some of the stuff I've been saying applies to really large cells, right?
  32  06:24

b0233y ctpr.txt:
  14  02:11
  15: So going back to oscillations each type of oscillation. I mean, each type of activity, is going to have its own feeling to human brain. The human brain has to make mistake. So with color, like there's a frequency range associated with each color. And so the argument is that the human brain has to make green green when it renders it and brown brown in contrast to green and the space in between his blue space or black space in between the ground.
  16  02:47

  20  03:21
  21: The way that the greenness represents a phase pattern, a phase pattern is accomplished by the frequencies of light and so yeah. So, you're your phase in it. Your year on frequency and amplitude is a phase pattern, The frequency and amplitude is a phase pattern. And so if you have but actually is all right.
  22  03:55

  28  06:11
  29: And so, what I'm saying, what I'm talking about right now is the is the EEG think the EG frequency range synchronization between two speakers when two human beings get together and talk? There is a sort of synchronization in their tonic oscillation, which is in the EEG. Frequency spectrum. So you can see that they are synchronizing while they are communicating.
  30  06:41

  56  11:34
  57: The, the brain has to has to tune into a frequency pattern and then sort of copy it. But if you have two brains and they can each tune into a frequency pattern and you start them on dramatically different frequency patterns, then how do the two brains come to sync?

When you have an author, they have to combine In the act of them, combining is causing the hold network, as a whole, to recognize an individual event. Because the act of, of changing your electrodynamics to match the new, my new change in the oscillation frequency, because it is a new change.

  43: There's a feeling, there's a feeling that is is actually. So you have this regular oscillator, that is exerting an electromagnetic regulatory pattern, that's observable. And if that oscillators frequency changes, that's going to be observable and neural network is going to be able to observe the change in the frequencies of oscillators and if that neural network was conscious, you would call it feelings.

  27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.

  32  12:39
  33: Because okay, here's the thing. If you have in the supercharges medic, nucleus? Right? Let's say if I, it hires that, what what does it fire at? Oh gosh. I forget, but let's just say fires like you have 20 million neurons. They're all firing at the same frequency, all right?
  34  12:58

  40  13:46
  41: Now, the thing is, these neurons receive the each independently receiving signal, so that, so when I say they oscillate together, they oscillate together with what's called a tonic frequency, which is like, okay. Well, just for regularity, I'm always gonna be ready to fire. So I'm gonna be oscillating at a regular sort of frequency, just so I'm always ready.
  42  14:09
  43: This is my ready for. Is my ready, frequency? I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. And it's a group oscillation. It's a big group of neurons that are oscillating. Okay, and then what's gonna happen then is this this bigger oscillation is going to create. It's going to influence the, the electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field of the entire brain, because it's bigger, because it's bigger than one neuron.

  343: ⟪ 297 characters skipped ⟫ples of EEG per one sample of of MRI data, but we can sort of like say that we can we can look at this and we can, we can create a correlation or in our data between the EG data and and in the slower frequency MRI dear and they were doing that with afternoons and some people still do that with avengers because regular affairs is slower than EG.

  81: So that could mean that you have an oscillation that where, okay? So let's say that you have like an offer frequency oscillation that has a certain pattern that is that has special and turnable characteristics that are you unique identifiers for a specific pattern. They represent maybe they represent a flower, okay?

   49: Frequency information. That's not right. There are there are people who are you know? What's that? It's Bill Murray. Yeah. There there people are people who like who are super smart researchers, but they're deep learning researchers and they honestly believe that neurons are dumb. They think that neurons are just dumb like, you know, like like they're not capable of understanding patterns, they're not they're not capable of distinguishing between do two types of patterns.
   50  12:45

   62  15:21
   63: Between like these are these are non-neuron cells that can do this and neurons are more capable than these non neurons cells, so I have this opportunity here to sort of like basically like design a new perceptron a new artificial neuron a new artificial neural network, that is not just frequency information but it's.
   64  15:49
   65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
   66  16:27

  104  24:56
  105: It does it's gonna do not just frequency information it will do and not just amplitude information it'll do spatial information because the larger amplitude will have a spatial impact on the next layer of cells, but also not only that. But this but I'm talking about a true 3D neural network so right now we have 2D internal networks now a 3D neural network means that every neuron and every every neuros circuit so neuro circuit is several neurons linked together and went in you know, the whole the whole time window of a neuron when it fires to when it reset is going to be like 10 milliseconds.
  106  25:47

  112  27:48
  113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?
  114  28:33

  118  29:30
  119: Right, you know all of this I guess but the supertiasmatic nucleus is super casematic nucleus it is about twenty million oscillating neurons, they're all oscillating at the same frequency. And most neurons are offsetting the same frequency, but there in but they're oscillating with a sort of temple which is called it's a.
  120  29:59

  124  31:02
  125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  126  31:35

  132  32:49
  133: And then but but, It's but basically okay so in EEG, there's something there's a there's a math there's a power lock principle called one over F. And it means that frequency and amplitude are inversely related And so that means that as frequency increases amplitude amplitude decreases and as frequency decreases amplitude increases.
  134  33:11

b0268y ctpr.txt:
  227  41:14
  228: Power the power rule and the idea is that I guess you if you're if you're frequency is decreasing your amplitude is increase and there's an inverse relationship between frequency and amplitude though and if you have if you're if it's taking longer if it's taking the longer amount of time.
  229  
  230  41:37
  231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.
  232

  6: To to to the to dipoles at the super macro scale and so the power law means is the parallel is one over f which I'm sure you've seen before but basically what it means is that the. One over ass means that there is it's about the frequency and it means that that the the there is the the frequency is an amplitudes or inversely proportional so if the frequencies increase amplitude is decreased if frequencies decrease amplitude's increase, right?

   79: So that's the idea of the artificial neuron is it's going to convey information by attack by a by touching that same neuron three times instead of in one instance three times in one instance. Because so it can so yeah so that's patient information so it's like yeah, we have a frequency information frequency is like I can tap you three times.
   80  17:16

   82  17:39
   83: In two places at one time and three places at one time and one place at one time in no place at one time and then in two places. And so I can send a spatial I can encode spatial patterns. Abong the frequency patterns I can code space patterns on the frequency patterns.
   84  18:00

   86  18:23
   87: I'm gonna send you a spatial pattern with every with every frequency pad. So, it's like you get a frequency pattern. We get a frequency get a special pattern. You gotta okay we see this thing it's not us. This is the frequency pattern can also have an opportunity. So you can have basically the temple spatial and a face.
   88  18:47

   92  19:31
   93: No fingers touching. So that's an example of like face or frequency or amplitude. It's the hardness of it. And so now you have three dimensions. We've got the frequency and which is the rate you've got the spatial which is how much contact and then you've got the hardness how much pressure or amplitude.
   94  19:55
   95: What's interesting is that is that in the book? On intelligence, he talks a lot about how there's their temple patterns and there are frequency patterns. And. It's really a really there's three types of temporal there's frequencies and there's phase. Pair and the thing is like, okay, so. The reason those are different is because I'm sorry no this.
   96  20:29
   97: I'm sorry it's. So actually so there aren't so there's temple other frequency but those can be converted into like you can have a wave light that can convey combine frequency so it's actually there's temple there's spatial where you're checking stations, okay, you can you could decode space your information as frequency information you could okay, but the problem is that.
   98  20:55
   99: That you're. Taking something that is you're convert your converting. Right so anyway, so you have your phase information so basically yes, so you have so if you have a frequency a frequency could encode beats like binary beats and you could. Decode spatial information from frequency information, right but. You're still losing a lot so I'm talking about it's like yeah this but here's the thing say so you're you're.
  100  21:39

  104  21:56
  105: Is what being transmitted is it only a matter of the frequency of the oscillation and the size of it because then you're back to two different patterns one is like how much like and that could be like that could be like a rich there could be interpreted as like force right it could be interpreted this force because there's more force that's being forcing as forcing the time window opens.

  579: So I pass on different frequency patterns to other people.
  580  
  581  02:45:30
  582: In fact the fact of speaking. Different frequency patterns are being transmitted in each stage of a word being spoken in each step of award being spoken and it's probably none see Asian of any word to be spoken. Those are sequences that are represented by different.
  583

  68  07:47
  69: So you have so you have you have imagined your tree and it collects all these diverse inputs. Now what happened was in computational neuroscience, they reduced they reduced them that single spike because it's not because spike is like it's not just spike. It's a frequency rate of spikes. So you got to reduce the end of the spike you're like well, okay, well we could pass along more information if we do like, You know.
  70  

  80  09:07
  81: So they got more out of a neural network. So the original perceptron was just on or off. And like okay, we'll use a vector representation we'll get more information out of it, but you're still only getting frequency information or or time domain information and. But so we'll multi-vestical release means spatial information so you've temporal information and you're missing spatial information and and this is a hypothesis but I but I that I had that it means spatial information and in fact that's true because if you you're not has between 0 and a neuron has been a neuron in the neocortex has between 0 and 3 vesicles.

   322: Energy if we talking about the full spectrum of the frequency from sonic vibration and then to static EEG and then from static EEG and then they go higher to light and then our is our reading devices are targeting into the correct spectrum of the original signal to the brain to trigger some action and or metrics of memory to trigger a movement or something so is the researchers aware that the full respect.
   323  
   324  01:03:16
   325: Of the frequency that we are researching now they are limited to the EEG limited to a light lightweight but do we look into the area of the spool spectrum and the change reaction of the energy change form so that we can drew into the most foundation of the original signal was created and done speaking this year.
   326  
   327  01:03:48
   328: Okay anybody want to go? I don't know the answer does anyone else want to answer it? I am. Of what you are saying sorry Dave, but um, are you talking about the actual frequency is in like what hurts um, like how many hurts like for example? I use low intensity repentive transcranial magnetic stimuli stimulation, which is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation and we use that to modulate those neural pathways and you can use for example one hurts.
   329  

   333  01:05:14
   334: Field point of view you are reading from the frequency point of view but the full spectrum of energy transformation that if you are doing how to say do master the whole change of the transformation, then we might only research on the certain area in a gap that we don't know that after this EEG from one hertz a vibrate intensively a transform into another and other type of energy that can be measured also so so I'll be reading at.
   335  

   342  01:07:02
   343: Signal of for example calcium signal or chloride signal then we can also visualize that activity. So we can and then the frequency actually did some work recently where a changed basically a memory from. Like. I I listened to the long-term memory with high frequencies simulation and then I turned down this memory like I did compulsive behavior.
   344  
   345  01:07:35
   346: I I generate a compulsive behavior specific one to a specific movement and turned it into a compulsive behavior with high frequencies stimulation and then I did low frequencies stimulation that is known to introduce LTD like long-term depression and then I, Got that that compulsive behavior back to our normal level with it, so frequency matters for simulation.
   347  

   367  01:11:24
   368: The measurement of the neuron of the energy of the neuron. What is the are we doing like core screened measurements or you know, basically getting like very precise changes in energy and infrequency and an amplitude and and and so on I I want to say that there we can add more to what what's being detected in terms of like amplitude and we can go even in it in more detail back to Kettering in a second, but the reason what Katerina said was very was a great.
   369  

   373  01:12:31
   374: What is the amplitude of? Spank. That's also that'd be interesting to know and and so what I think will Katarina was saying was that she's successfully stimulated in her neuron almost to the point that it was going to fire so that it would you know, maybe that means that that you know, if it fires in a regular basis like a tonic frequency anyways, it's gonna fire just a little bit faster because it's even more ready to fire so when when the next round of signals comes through that that is going to be part of.
   375  
   376  01:13:02
   377: You know basically but then the other thing that that Caterina said was that the the grant in terms of you know, the granularity of the encoding when you're talking about, you know, like first of all eliciting elicit illicitating a long-term memory with with high frequency stimulation and then generating compulsive behavior with high frequency stimulation, so basically making this like stimulating this neuron so they can basically or micro, you know, micro circuit or micro column or cluster of neuro cluster of.
   378  
   379  01:13:37
   380: Cells it represents the neurosur circuit whatever catering stimulated in and you welcome to give us more detail on that in a second that caused the animal to have a high frequency response that what what generated compulsive behavior and then Caterina reversed it by using LTD long-term depression to issue a look frequency stimulation.
   381  
   382  01:14:06
   383: I mean to use low frequency stimulation to basically calm down the animals behave. Or to slow down the the high frequency firing of that neuron or that micro cluster of neurons and and it this is this extremely profound because it speaks exactly what David is saying about the the the granularity of the of measuring and stimulating or the course coarse grained measurement and coarse grained stimulation of of energy at the neuronal level and the micro micro circuit micro neural circuit level so I want to go ahead and hand it back to can arena if you want but I just wanted to.
   384  

   388  01:14:56
   389: Yeah you explained that's really what? Thank you so much. And sometimes explaining it. Because I'm doing the work so it's sometimes you're stuck in the subject so it's harder for you to explain it but yeah that's um that exactly what we are seeing that the the frequency of the stimulation that type of which which type of input is stimulating these brain cells and in the slice at least which which doesn't always mean it's one hundred percent also and, Vivosystem the same way but at least in the slice we can see also that the location of where we stimulate in the dendritic arbor makes also a difference, so we need to weigh less, um, Way less um synapses to be stimulated on the distal areas of a dendrite in the striatum then in if you get closer to the solar then you need more more sign up to the activated and that's because the the dendrite the dendritic arbor the shaft like, Not this fine the the eyelid selves the chef they ask thinner, so I bet the spine size is still the same so the impact of those mines being activated is bigger, so um strong inputs of chorus.
   390  

   502  01:37:36
   503: I'll show you the experiments of it helps anyone the thing is those all those organisms don't have a skull they won't. Whatever bacteria you're viruses, they don't have a skull and also those papers that came up that 5g is make something called arranged that on and those those don't it was shown that those high frequency they don't go through the skull at all, it's really really hard actually to get signals deep into the brain so I.
   504  
   505  01:38:12
   506: I'm quite doubtful of that being if if that would be the case it would be actually very happy we wouldn't need to do all those brain surgeries you could just blast things and people would improve like practice there there's TMS with very very high magnetic fields, you can simulate brain regions and there's a bunch of studies like that then at MIT and others where you change plus the city depending also on the frequency, but you need really really powerful.
   507  

   884  02:44:53
   885: And it so goes back to I so I was at the the grocery store and I had this idea because I was listening to Katarina. And the other day and another talk where we had some other great speakers and so the idea was so Katerina was just saying that earlier before many people came that she was she she managed to stimulate a mouse to basically she elicited long-term memory with high frequency stimulation and then generated a compulsive behavior with high frequency stimulation and the mouse has had like impulsive behavior.
   886  
   887  02:45:35
   888: And and then she used a low freak frequency stimulation to induce LDT and long-term depression and that caused the the animals compulsive behavior to go away. So that's an upcoming paper that she's working on. It sounds really exciting but what was what what I was thinking about a lot was well, what is the role of of high frequency stimulation and and low frequencies this?
   889  

   896  02:47:03
   897: We over ourselves and so people who have less self-control who interrupts too much that maybe they they're they're interneuron system is damaged and you know, and maybe people have or ADHD have a dysfunctional internal system or in him. Atory system and and and then and then maybe we could solve that if we gave people low frequency stimulation to induce LTD in those areas that were really, you know, they had too much stimulation.
   898  

   908  02:49:11
   909: And they found that a disregulation of the immune system and the brain can lead to such complicated behaviors like social anxiety. Which then explains a lot about autism disorders. So yeah, it's a really cool thought and is we're going on towards that direction. Frequency versus low frequency stimulus a you're talking about the electric stimulators.
   910  

   923  02:52:09
   924: So it's I was just gonna say it's really interesting that the same paradigm also applies in a less precise way with clinical RTMS where you know, 10 hertz high frequencies stimulation as opposed to increase activity of the dorsal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but if you, Stimulate at one hertz which is relatively low frequency it actually inhibits and what people do is they'll use high frequency on the left hemisphere and low frequency on the right hemisphere because of somewhat dated ideas that there are some laterality in depression pathologies such that you have under activity of the left hemisphere and over activity of the right hemisphere.
   925  
   926  02:52:57
   927: So it's it's really interesting to see the same sort of pattern of high frequency low frequency stimulation of sort of being sort of recapitulated at a larger scale. Yeah interestingly totally.
   928  
   929  02:53:17
   930: Easily so we you know, we all are more complicated than we realize and you can you know, you can do a lot of work finding out and tracking and mapping these um inhibitory pathways and excited to pathways and because obviously if you stimulate with high frequency and inhibitory pathway, you're actually then inhibiting that part of the brain even though you're using excitatory simulation.
   931  

   935  02:54:06
   936: Then it's you know, there's extra layers. I guess to. So the light the frequency your printer is the pulse frequency is there right and yeah exactly so the the light the blue light opens up, um positive ion channels which then do polarizes the cell and then generate some action potential and then we have the opposite effect if one puts on puts in the cellular adoption with the yellow light, you would activate a chloride pump so it have high.
   937  

   977  03:02:19
   978: Oh so in terms of the the granularity with an early ink or with oxygenetics potentially like what what the catarano did was she listened to long-term memory with high frequency stimulation generated compulsive behavior with high frequency simulation in a mouse and then so so maybe I don't know if that means like the animals hand was was was moving compulsively or something like it's it's arm but then with low frequency stimulation the the long-term depression was induced and the animals a limb stops moving in the Then I I've been thinking about this idea well what if for a couple days actually what if the inhibited inhibitory interneuron system that Katarina was talking about yesterday what if that dysfunction is sort of like responsible for things like attention deficit disorder and it turns out that is that's that's that's um, that that was a good guess because there's a lot of research in that area there is you know, Ketteringer product that the inhibitory neuron system might be damaged in the case of of Alzheimer's and then, It was it Alzheimer's and then also I think the one that came up was autism and nervousness if that was another thing that came up which is these are all very interesting things that so basically we're talking about like okay well would would a person gain more agency if they had more low frequency stimulation basically inducing more more long-term.
   979  

  1127  03:29:00
  1128: But. If you want to be precise at some point and to really fix tissue again in a precise way. I think you you have to one day go that route because you know that those implants. Doesn't matter he does different simulation and humans because it isn't neurosurgeon and you have also over time that you have tissue dimensional electric stimulation and then it doesn't work anymore after a while and then you have to adjust the frequency or the view implants and, And so on and so forth like the electric stimulation how we do right now and humans have also a lot of complications so.
  1129  

  1250  03:53:31
  1251: I mean, they're pretty easy to entrain with different firing rates, you know, especially how genetics we do that all the time with the rhythmic systems is can these subset of cells and train the rhythm in order words in other words, like what is the minimum necessary amount of cells that you can stimulate within a repeated fashion that's in a different frequency than that of the normal biological frequency and can you entrain that rhythm so that It resets it and you can kind of figure out the underpinnings of what is the minimum necessary circuit in order to take control of whatever function is that you're measuring and we do that all the time but yeah, it's a you know, it's an interesting thought that you know, perhaps we don't necessarily need to stimulate as much as we do you know, you can you can take three neurons and control 30 of them something like that.
  1252  

  1389  04:17:08
  1390: I should see if I can if I can pull my notes up right here, she was able to basically elicit a long-term memory that involved height frequency stimulation from an animal and then she had another animal to generate the compulsive behavior with high freest high frequency stimulation that matched that frequency and then so the animal then began to exhibit the the, Compulsive behavior right because because it was based in this high frequency stimulation, but then she used low frequency stimulation to to induce LDT which is a long-term depression and what happened was the animals compulsive behavior went away such so that's sort of thing is like has been demonstrated in a mouse what's also a demonstrated amasses is them, you know, taking a scanning base the basic primitive memories like fear and, Like a fear response to a certain thing and then transferring that with opportunities to another mouse so that's it's an example of reading and writing to the human to to a brain and when we have the high definition of neural link we're gonna have high definition reading and a high definition writing capabilities in the future, so maybe a high definition image.
  1391  

  1668  05:07:54
  1669: In one area you may have a compulsivity disorder right you may have you may interrupt people too much you may I don't know you may have too much stress to you know, like maybe maybe there's some length between PPT SD and certain or OCD and a certain parts of the brain that are stimulating like basically over stimulated and so if you could if you could basically estimate the stimulate those those parts of the brain with, With a low frequency stimulation and induce LT LD LTD low, basically the idea is that you could make that behavior go away and and you could so basically by using you know, either high frequency stimulation like 10 hertz or low frequency stimulation at one hertz to stimulate or inhibit different areas of the brain.

  36: The amount of information that one neuron can pass along and to the rest of the network but but and so the the whole the whole thing is like everything in deep learning and deep learning is like reduce to you know, you have this network but it only is processing frequency information for the most part it's not processing spatial information and when when you can if you could, Wait, like we can say like now with the latest research that has been that this the perceptron is basically invalid it's based upon this this space upon.

  131  22:39
  132: Then you can oh yeah, so like so if you're doing for if you're doing like a 40 transformer on I'm not not on the whole not on all of time, but basically on a very discrete amount of time or if you're doing like wavelet then you could. Then you could have both time and frequency domain if that makes sense.

Of your brain rhythms which which would be interesting but I but I just wanted to sort of dial down on that and in just ask you if you really know if it's not possible to like for neural length specifically to reduce the amount of electrical stimulation to where you just stereoten like one neuron at a time because that seems like that want to be a feature and it just patient with if it's actually not.

I know it's it's it's there's a lot of differences, you know, I've looked into it a lot there's a lot of you know, I guess you can get very specific about the frequency patterns and the direction of where you're sending the stimulation and and and so it's not if It's.

   710: Right on right on I and by the way, I'm I so I guess if was the founder of TMS was at Lenox. I don't remember there have been so many people revised the technology, I mean, we had a Japanese person in our lab who further refined the coil and frequency technology after that and we had another postdoc who did from Caltech actually she came from Caltech and she quotes called she created another new coil design so you could say that there was an originator yes.

   764: It is a brain stimulation device that uses red and so so infrared and near infrared light to kind of like, Basically penetrate through the skull and stimulate the brain and kind of entrain the brain to fire at a particular frequency. So for example people's Alzheimer's they find that when they use EEGs stimulate study people with Alzheimer's with the EEGs, they find that they have a reduction in in the gamma band and the gamma band is associated with you know, some of the higher order cognition, you know, like insights creative creative endeavors.

   775  
   776: And and they've found that this treatment actually has FCC in treating the symptoms of Alzheimer's and what they found is they in order to kind of like come up the next donation of how it works is through some mysterious mechanism, we don't know what the mechanism is whenever is a brain is stimulated by light that's at a particular frequency so somehow the neurons detaches that they're being stimulated by light and they will do this thing called entrainment where they will synchronize with the frequency that is being.
   777  02:03:28
   778  
   779: Stimulated so I mentioned earlier that people with Alzheimer's have a reduction in the gamma band in in injuries, so when you stimulate the brain with a gamma frequency and the neurons, you know, the they will tend to synchronize with the gamma with the stimulation so you can you're kind of like training the brain to recapitulate its ability to fire at gamma and this is this has been shown to work this has been shown through clinical trials it initially worked in rats, so they developed.

   980: Um, I think I'm well, I guess I guess I'm what I'm trying to narrow down sort of like. Because there was a guy a scientist who proposed a way that quantum effects could affect memory. And and but it doesn't is um, it doesn't directly connect to some other ideas of memory and so there's that in there and then there's if people who talk about you know, how basically, you know, the quantum quantum range is if is a frequency range, I mean it not sorry do I misspoke maybe I'm getting tired and definitely haven't but so now the quantum range is like we're talking about very small things right this is this is common knowledge and we're talking about.

Oh sure. So that duck gives me a rough, you know, what what what you're you know trying to do is it's a fascinating can already, you know be able to get a noise ratio signal to noise ratio that it can enable you are able to make it a product but that's that's that.

    58  

   194  36:26
   195: So so I so I so what I thought was that since you can measure single cells with with the electrodes that you that you're injecting on the tip of a needle or basically right that's what you're using or you can measure basically the broader activity like like maybe of many cells and maybe 200 cells at once from that electrode maybe from the brainstem or something and so you can monitor you can monitor even without the application of drugs just the frequency changes to the oscillation activity.

   449  01:16:08
   450: Alright just basic stuff and then another layer is going to take higher level features. It's a hierarchical model of learning. And then so the idea is that so information for the brain at the lowest possible bit bit rate is just like a coincidence pattern. It's it's to have two things on to two neurons in a at least two neurons within a certain frequency range and a certain spatial parameter firing at a lower at a lower level or maybe at the input level.

   799: Basically custom tracks that had ISO chronic beats and I was using the line I was so there's this guy named Lennox in the 1980s and he Lenox Delano. Oaks protocol was basically a biofeedback frequency program where he was capturing EG patterns and then using them to to change light basically light he didn't really have sound at that point.
   800  
   801  02:17:26
   802: So he was just changing light effects like the light would flash with the frequencies of your of your brain activity and, But he would also encode it with with with frequency with certain frequency ranges certain frequency patterns as well. And he he reported that that his patients had some significant success with their own in many cases with their with their issues.
   803

   808: And but I wanted to do it in VR so basically I would have your brainwaves driving light and sound effects and they would change what you see in here and they're encoded to isochronicbeats and and they would they would really cause us like intense sort of like self-awareness. I made like them some meditative state and if I change the the frequency patterns that I was encoding of course, you know, then that would that would affect that your the changes in your mental state, but it was just it was very particular it was very interesting because I began to feel as if I was listening to I began to feel so of getting.

   886: And and this is what we did. I think if you look I I think it might be the video you see the one of the spheres but no I see the one with like the frames and I think you have different frequency bands represented for a stream of frames right yeah, so that was that was the later version of the project so in the in the beginning.

  133: I'm so sorry it was pointed out. I guess Adam pointed it out that that the frequency of of EG is is usually much faster than than the. That you know, then then your blood flow which has to react to to your neurons firing right and and but I sort of wonder about how that how it works exactly because there is a there's like a path between you know neurons firing and at in a cortical column and then you know, basically that activity being large enough that you're gonna have dipole activity which is a large scale, you know, global brain dipole activity, which is which is what is is gonna be picked up by the, Sensor and and so I wonder about the timing of that and in how that how you know, because so that so it's what I'm saying is like so there's a delay also between when eat when when when you're neurons fire at a low level and when when the dipole is gonna fire to similar to how there's a delay between when you're you're you're neurons fire, and when blood flow happens and I just this so the timing the timing issue, there is is very.
  134

  136: It's very interesting and yeah. I'd like to know more about that. Yeah. Thank you this is Sharena and this may seem like a silly question but how high of a frequency can. Can EEGs pick up is it 80 hertz is it? 60 hertz does it depend on which EEG electrodes are being used this is Sharena and I am done speaking.
  137  

  141  23:45
  142: But I know that like for. The 80, you know hurts it's hard for like it's hard to get that but I think there's also a positive correlation between the density of the EG in other words the number of electrodes and that capacity to for acquiring that frequency but you know, like on I mean, I know that like it can acquire like 40 30 and it's it's not good at acquiring.
  143  

  156  26:11
  157: Yeah. What I was thinking about it at first I read that sentence but they use the word acquired and that using the word of acquisition makes me think about it that maybe they're using this word because of showing that this is the frequency that they can catch using their sets.
  158  

  171  28:47
  172: Yeah actually I think so if you if it talks about the brain waves frequency, it's based on what also chirina mentioned that it might come from denyquist equation that you need at least two times more than sampling rate to capture that frequency and your signal so if it would be for example one to 28 hertz for sampling yeah definitely the brain beam should be less than 64 hertz to get captured in the signal.
  173  

  186  31:19
  187: But yeah good points. I have a question regarding the frequency that you guys were talking about because when you guys talk about something great frequency makes sense, but when when you start talking about the frequency of the brain, I don't know exactly what you mean since I'm not a neuroscientist.
  188  
  189  31:35
  190: I'm not training that field so when you talk about the frequency of the brain what? I'm having a hard time picturing a bunch of neurons. You know extracting away a single point a single quantity of frequency from a bunch of neurons faring so can you guys help me clear that?
  191  
  192  31:58
  193: Yeah and the brain it has numerous different frequencies happening all of the time and a lot of times it has multiple frequencies that are superimposed upon each other for example if brainwaves that my lab has discovered is a very high frequency oscillation that only happens at the peaks of data waves so as this 130-ish hurts frequency that happens on top of these about eight to fourteen hurts frequencies, so there's the question of okay.
  194  

  201  33:28
  202: And well the people they popping at different rates, okay that is that is some sort of frequency it is a lot of noise but it is it's a bunch of clapping and it's a bunch of signals they were to to collapse such that half of the people thought that one rate and the other people thought that another rate then that then you can determine two different frequencies from that and, It is kind of strong because multiple people are in sync with each other so it's kind of similar with brain waves and if everyone in the room was to clap at the same frequency then that would create a very large and strong brain wave and this phenomenon is known as the one over f rule otherwise known as a a power frequency dynamic that happens in the brain so if you have brain waves that are at higher frequencies then you'll generally find that they are lower in power, but if you have, Waves that are high.
  203  
  204  34:40
  205: In power then you'll usually find that they are alone over infrequency. And so the whole idea to keep in mind is synchronization between different neurons and how well synchronized they are. So that if a lot of people are clapping at the same time, then it will produce a lot of power but if there are a bunch of different people clapping out a bunch of different rates that may be a higher number that may be a high amount of frequency but not very much power because it's not as synchronized.

This is Sharina and I think that when it comes to attention conditions what will tend to happen is that the signal that is collected will generally be noisier maybe it won't need to be trained upon but it would be noisier not just at one frequency but across a range of frequency is.

However what is implied in both quantum entanglement and in the double slit experiment is an oscillation in at least two places, one where the particle was measured and two where and when it was observed. So are our eyes transmitting a frequency event to the environment in 4D that is traced back in time to the measured particle, simply because the particle was some phase pattern that was defining space itself, and that implies that we are looking into a kind of liquid space at the quantum range, its liquid to us because its moving faster in time compared to us. So that from our perspective time is moving faster.

  27  My grandfather led a team of people that put the first GPS Satellite into space, one day he explained to me that time on a Satellite moves more slowly than time on earth, so they had to learn that to make sure time recorded on GPS Satellites stayed in sync with earth time, but they (Scientists) were also able to prove Einstein's conjecture about General Relativity meaning time would be slower in the upper atmosphere.

  29  Oscillators attract frequencies, the oscillating power bands in the brain, Alpha, Theta, Delta, Gamma, and Beta each maintain an oscillation pattern that creates an electromagnetic attraction force. When I am observing something, it is like an oscillator powerband is interacting with a particle field, changing the entire shape of space itself, as the movement of that one particle affects the oscillation of the rest of the field of space. The human being as a body of oscillators is also one big electromagnetic oscillator that is literally defining space itself with each interaction.

   102:    7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
   103     8  
   104:    9: In other words my conjecture is that the principle of 1/F in neuroscience is scale invariant and that it applies to everything at all scales. Essentially the universe consists of quantum waves and galactic supercluster sized waves and every wave has the same inverse relationship between ~~amplitude~~ magnitude and frequency
   105    10  
   106:   11: Amplitude is not always inverse to frequency, nor is duration, but my hypothesis is that magnitude might be inverse to frequency. In the brain at the scale of EEG it appears that amplitude is inverse to frequency, and at the neuron scale it appears that amplitude is fixed but the duration is changing, this led to the idea that magnitude, the combination of amplitude & duration might have an inverse relationship to frequency at all scales of the universe. Including at the neuron action potential scale, and at the brainwave measurement scale. Hypothesis: When amplitude shifts to not have an inverse relationship to frequency the duratio of the wave has also shifted.
   107    12  

   111    16  
   112:   17: So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?
   113    18  

   117    22  
   118:   23: So it’s frequency is supposed to change without a change in amplitude, but there is an amplitude change that is being passed through the action potential as a duration of the potential, or the potential's decay time, or the delay in time for how long the action potential is open before it is hyperpolarized, and potentially it sends a message to other neurons by releasing more neurotransmitters but also it collects a receipt of the extra transmission with h
   119    24  
   120:   25: However if the frequency changes, and the amplitude stays the same then the duration must change, the shape of the waveform must change.
   121    26  

   123    32  
   124:   33: Light peps, or slow slams. This idea would be consistent with physics, that amplitude as duration or time cannot stay the same if frequency is changing.

   129:   81: see I was in a discussion the other day, talking about how the synaptic inputs can increase or decrease the membrane potential, potentially causing an action potential that has a variable amplitude and frequency, that effects the membrane potential of another synapse
   130:   82  in comp neuro, and in many AI models, they simplify so that all action potentials are equal, and they only take into account the frequency of the spike.
   131:   83: but the amplitude of the wave matters, because that impact is going to determine how much the next synapse's membrane potential is going to be effected, which critically is going to effect it's firing frequency and amplitude also.
   132    84  so I have been focusing on how synapses use spikes to program other synapses,

   135    18  
   136:   19: so space is expanded because its area is the high amplitude of a low frequency
   137    20  
   138:   21: stars are crunched because the high frequency (velocity, relative time of action) corresponds with less area less space and less amplitude
   139    22  
   140:   23: the amplitude of particle scattering is high in spaced out space, but its low in high frequency oscillating space (stars, planets, atoms)
   141    24

   161    42  
   162:   43: Micah: Okay, but in the neuron itself, the amplitude of the action potential is thought to be fixed at the threshold for firing, but duration can vary. Since Magnitude is the combination of Amp & Dur, could there be an inverse relationship between Frequency & Magnitude at both scales?

If one neuron is connected to 200 downstream neurons, when that one neuron fires, with varying strength, varying amounts of vesicle activation, varying quantities and types of neurotransmitters, how are those 200 downstream neurons affected in a different way?

   291:   73: ⟪ 405 characters skipped ⟫ adjustment to the phase oscillating pattern from individual cell level to aggregate brain waves at greater scales. Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

   304    14  
   305:   15: Essentially the wave form of the action potential by itself is a frequency with amplitude, but the multi-possible microvesicle release, with options between 0, 1, 2, 3 vesicles being released, depending on the wave form of the action potential, that means that both the amplitude & frequency of the action potential is being transmitted, in a smaller form, across the synapse to other dendrite computers.
   306    16  
   307:   17: If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.
   308    18  

   310    24  
   311:   25: So imagine that a low amplitude high frequency phasic action potential spike transmits both neurotransmitters and a mechanical wave that is received as sodium channels open on the other side of the synapse. The delta (or amount) of the mechanical wave ought to correlate 1:1 with the delta of the synaptic transmission.
   312    26  

   315      3  
   316:     4: working with EEG, and talking to Neuroscientist Morgan Hough for a year when I was hosting NeurotechSF event I had learned notion ingrained in me that there was a 1/f relationahip between amplitude and frequency in brainwaves
   317      5  

   319      9  
   320:    10: when reading buszaki I thought more deeply about the 1/f relationship between amplitude and frequency (for groups of neurons), and the fact that neurons expand when they fire
   321     11  
   322:    12: how high frequency has low amplitude and low frequency has high amplitude
   323     13  

   327     17  
   328:    18: I thought about frequency being in the inverse of time and frequency the inverse of amplitude at the EEG scale, and the expansion of neurons in the soma right before they fire phasically (phasic firing is high frequency firing)
   329     19  

   331     27  
   332:    28: I realized that a high frequency firing might created a amplitude release of neurotransmitrers which might open lots of potassium channel receptors inhibiting other neurons faster, creating a collective representation in a columized layer, edge community, circuit, or neural array that would be collectively perceived by the next array, and so on, and that the entire bunch of neurons would learn invariant representations,
   333     29  

   335     35  
   336:    36: so I had this idea from neuroscience that neurons were expanding on mass when they fired like an a action potential, which I also think of as like lightning, positive and negative charges between the sky and earth split so much fhere is a flash followed by a bang, light and sound, frequency and amplitude
   337     37  

   339     40  but here on the table was
   340:    41: amplitude is inverse to frequency
   341:    42  time is inverse to frequency
   342  

   355    122  
   356:   123: We may need to model the ionotropic brain. That means modeling how calcium and potassium ions, stored in the dendrite soma, are changing amplitude & frequency of the action potential, which changes the synaptic output, ie how many vesicles are activated, and what types of neurotransmitter are released downstream, which further alters the ionotropic balance of dendrites on the receiving end. If one neuron is connected to 200 downstream neurons, when that one neuron fires, with varying strength, varying amounts of vesicle activation, varying quantities and types of neurotransmitters, how are those 200 downstream neurons affected in a different way?
   357    124  

   360    7  
   361:   8: I think he was searching for some longer term memory than could be provided by the mechanism of strengthened synapses, something that could also both learn and react within three milliseconds and his answer was that inside the synapse the CaMKII interaction with micro-tubule was just the ideal mechanism to both store long term memories, and somehow alter the spiking in terms of either amplitude or frequency.
   362    9  

   370    10  
   371:   11: the granule cell goes across the dendrites of the pyramidal cells, connecting perhaps several times, which is interesting because their noise within one particular neuron can be increased or decreased simply by the number of connections, but the potential amplitudes & frequency combinations are multiplied with every additional synaptic connection, or divided by each synaptic connection, so a loss of one synaptic connection would make that granule cell quieter in the array,
   372    12

   376:   21: ⟪ 260 characters skipped ⟫ron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.

   382    39  

   385    36  
   386:   37: the higher frequency is the narrowing on of space amplitude, while the lower frequency broadens space amplitude

   395    39  Dean: 
   396:   40: but since each is only one of a thousand (or ten thousand), it's up to the receiving neuron to integrate it with all other signals to determine whether or not to fire and with what amplitude or frequency.
   397    41  

   407    18  
   408:   19: from the perspective of base for the off off & on on are 50 percent of the possible states, but I supposed that inreality each possible instance of off on or on off state where some part of the cosmos is in a mass & time amplitude crunching state while some part is in a high frequency expanding mass dissipating state.
   409    20  

   420    29  
   421:   30: Instead the synapse is the core unit of computation in the brain, the ndma receptors and the dendrites help recognize and sort coincidence patterns, transmitting a wave across the axon to another synapse which breaks down the wave into ion deposits (sodium etc....) this allows synaptic calculations to control the amplitude and frequency of axon potentials, but reset if, when, how frequently another neurons fires, and whether it will be inhibitory or excitatory.

   440:   3: Gamma waves are the brain’s optimal frequency associated with increased compassion, optimal brain function, awareness of reality and increased mental abilities. Though more rapid than beta waves, gamma brainwaves have virtually unnoticeable amplitude and can be found in every part of the brain. Gamma waves serve as a binding mechanism between all parts of the brain and help to improve brain function and perception.

   465:   31: are typical neuronal firing rates, including either or both the slower (higher amplitude more social) tonic oscillatory firing rates or the faster higher frequency (lower amplitude less social)
   466    32  

   474    48  
   475:   49: So phase sensors are. In fact, everything in space is a face sensor. In a sense, everything has a frequency in a magnitude. The magnitude is amplitude plus duration and there's an inverse relationship between the magnitude and the frequency. So it's not, it's, but when we think of like the brain, it isn't.
   476    50  

   485    204  
   486:   205: So humans scale, consciousness, is definitely like a very specific pattern of power band frequencies that are oscillating at certain rates and rates is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range, that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the oscillating entity that is the brain, and the person, and the other people.

   509    122  18:19
   510:   123: But also, they are beating up space time because heating up space is the same as speeding up space time. And so the, but then some of space time is also slowed down because inhibited, so it's frequency is slower, but it's at the same time, it's amplitude is higher so it's a habitated inhibited but it takes up a lot of space.
   511    124  

   516    302  48:25
   517:   303: Entropy is like participation of mass into energy and which is like. So participation entrepreneur. Does that make sense and to this energy? So the universities either mouse or energy but the universe is really like, either mass or frequency or the universe versus either distance, or frequency, or the universe is either amplitude or frequency like this distance and amplitude.
   518    304  

   520    551  01:20:41
   521:   552: Actually, the diversion of frequency and and amplitude. So masses, the amplitude relative to the frequency of energy.
   522    553  

   529    35  05:40
   530:   36: It's kind of like these are they're different phases, different phase patterns, different phase speeds. It's really the different phase velocities, right? That's the difference between I would say this, that's why a neutron and a positron. And and I try and do not merge. It's because they have different a different frequency patterns and and they have different amplitudes.
   531    37  

   541    39  05:12
   542:   40: It's lower frequency, higher amplitude. And I think of it, as more of the observer of macroscale patterns time, and then I think a
   543    41  

   545    51  07:04
   546:   52: But just a hypothesis it's gonna be like this rate is like the frequency gets reduced over time, but the amplitude grows up and that means that the the sixth layer is like the observer. And are they like the? It's like the that's where the it's like it's like when you look around the world imagine you're kind of like looking inside your skull a little bit.
   547    53  

   550    60  07:41
   551:   61: It's really a lot slower than sensory and potato but it's but it's, it's bigger picture. It's it's a higher amplitude. So it's it's more network. It's when the network comes together, the highest levels and the Delta frequency.
   552    62  

   555    327  
   556:   328: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
   557    329  

   570    90  22:33
   571:   91: What's happening is a lot of charges is, is building up now. So these. So, if these neurotransmitters, if they arrive faster, okay? Then they're going to start to, but put in a lot of energy really fast, right? Because they're transmitted, they're sending energy faster, but if they arrive slower, what's going to happen is, they're this because there's a one F relationship between amplitude and frequency in the brain.
   572    92  
   573    93  23:07
   574:   94: What's going to happen is that these neurotransmitters are going to, they're going to basically a, you're gonna get, you're gonna get a high amplitude, low frequency burst, which is going to, which is going to, which is going to
   575    95  

   583    94  21:19
   584:   95: Open up a lot faster depending on what receptors are over there. And then you have, you know, basically potential potentially like like the maximum bicycle release that would result from basically the at the shape of the amount of Wyndham passing gets released in a sufficient amount that's going to sort of determine the, the the out, the shape of the action potential, whether it's high amplitude, low frequency or low amplitude, high frequency, and so that's going to then determine how, you know, how many vegetables get released material zero one and two and three.
   585    96  22:08

   588     92  20:12
   589:    93: And, and the rush of potassium opening would would either inhibit the cell or it would cause cell to shorten the action potential, right? And if you have at the at the frequency of of the action potential is shorter than the amplitude of its radius is going to be larger think because there's a there's a there's an inverse relationship so if the if the frequency is smaller the amplitude is larger if the amplitude is smaller, the frequencies longer or larger.
   590     94  20:58

   592    290  01:09:49
   593:   291: But it's creating it's it's it's creating a high amplitude but low, frequency a depression, a low frequency,
   594    292  01:10:06

   596    320  01:16:34
   597:   321: But when you feed the brain, a lot of low frequency trains like of electrical simulation like one hurts that that might inhibit basically inhibit short-term memories. In the sense that the low frequency is going to trigger higher amplitude, low frequency,
   598    322  01:17:01
   599:   323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
   600    324  01:17:34

   602    328  01:18:40
   603:   329: Okay. But yeah, I mean recent researchers like really have done have better. Have studied LTP and LL DP as like basically, you know, the high amplitude, low frequency LTD signals, basically, stimulating the brain with like, a one herbs frequency, that is going to de-synchronize groups of neurons. That is going to not be synchronized.
   604    330  01:19:14

   617    24  04:46
   618:   25: Can look for patterns that are basically defined in terms of space and because of like which which nodes lit up and patterns that are defined in time and in that allows basically my frequency and and the patterns are also defined by amplitude because the the low frequency patterns have higher amplitude.
   619    26  05:30

   624     16  00:42
   625:    17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
   626     18  

   628    121  19:28
   629:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.
   630    123  

   638    36  06:43
   639:   37: So it creates such so it creates. So you can have a really unique sounding tone. And in terms of like, how many receptors, how many sodium receptors, how many calcium receptors are active, how many potassium receptors are active? Because it's going to change, like the amp amplitude and frequency of the firing of the end, the fate and the phase characteristics.
   640    38  07:13
   641:   39: Well, the phase characteristics are going to be like really amplitude and frequency which are in which are inverted. And in terms of like their proportions, so greater amplitude means less frequency greater frequency means, less amplitude, right? And this happens at multiple scale, so you have like this multi-scale temple, spatial phase space at the brain creates and the brain to text.
   642    40  07:51

   645    22  05:52
   646:   23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
   647    24  06:26

   650    13  02:58
   651:   14: Like everything that's like below high gamma. So like low gamma and high and all the betas and alpha data and delta like those power bands are perhaps you're like low amplitude neurosurgeon set attract coop cooperation because they're low amplitude. Widespread firing results in neurons, that sort of like send a love frequency.
   652    15  03:46

   655    32  
   656:   33: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
   657    34  

   660    14  02:20
   661:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
   662    16  02:45

   669    60  11:32
   670:   61: Now, the way, that's the reason I said, waves it, so the action potential has a waveform, right? The shape that determined by an amplitude and duration. So has an amplitude and a derision. Now, it was a second. It has a frequency an altitude duration, the amplitude, but they're all that it's tied together the duration.
   671    62  12:11

   676    30  05:54
   677:   31: And that's going to change the amplitude or frequency of the of the action potential. So that's, that's an idea. I don't know what you think about. Yeah. So I like if you change the rest, like, let's say, you, you're injecting a current. And so one, one thing I meant to say earlier that my clarify some things, the some of the stuff I've been saying applies to really large cells, right?
   678    32  06:24

   681    20  03:21
   682:   21: The way that the greenness represents a phase pattern, a phase pattern is accomplished by the frequencies of light and so yeah. So, you're your phase in it. Your year on frequency and amplitude is a phase pattern, The frequency and amplitude is a phase pattern. And so if you have but actually is all right.
   683    22  03:55

   686    26  10:49
   687:   27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.
   688    28  11:34

   696    104  24:56
   697:   105: It does it's gonna do not just frequency information it will do and not just amplitude information it'll do spatial information because the larger amplitude will have a spatial impact on the next layer of cells, but also not only that. But this but I'm talking about a true 3D neural network so right now we have 2D internal networks now a 3D neural network means that every neuron and every every neuros circuit so neuro circuit is several neurons linked together and went in you know, the whole the whole time window of a neuron when it fires to when it reset is going to be like 10 milliseconds.
   698    106  25:47

   700    124  31:02
   701:   125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
   702    126  31:35

   704    132  32:49
   705:   133: And then but but, It's but basically okay so in EEG, there's something there's a there's a math there's a power lock principle called one over F. And it means that frequency and amplitude are inversely related And so that means that as frequency increases amplitude amplitude decreases and as frequency decreases amplitude increases.
   706    134  33:11

   709    227  41:14
   710:   228: Power the power rule and the idea is that I guess you if you're if you're frequency is decreasing your amplitude is increase and there's an inverse relationship between frequency and amplitude though and if you have if you're if it's taking longer if it's taking the longer amount of time.
   711    229

That's also that'd be interesting to know and and so what I think will Katarina was saying was that she's successfully stimulated in her neuron almost to the point that it was going to fire so that it would you know, maybe that means that that you know, if it fires in a regular basis like a tonic frequency anyways, it's gonna fire just a little bit faster because it's even more ready to fire so when when the next round of signals comes through that that is going to be part of.

   850     14:   10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower amplitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)

It replaces the classical notion of a single unique classical trajectory for a system with a sum, or a function integral, over an infinity of quantum mechanically possible trajectories to compute a quantum amplitude.
   875:    39:   168: because e equals mc2 energy equals mass accelerated, energy is a high frequency signal with low amplitude, mass is a low frequency (slow) signal with high amplitude

You can consider synaptic interactions as current transients, conductance transients, transmitter release probabilities... Etc, etc, etc..
   896     60:   129: Again, this is a misconception and it depends on the model used.. For example, in a conductance-based neuron model, a spike in the presynaptic neuron triggers a transient conductance increase in the postsynaptic neurons, whose amplitude depends on the efficacy of the synapse.. This is capturing the essence of what happens in the real brain, the neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminal will bind to the postsynaptic receptors, which can be ion channels (at least the ones working on a short time scale) and the result is an influx of certain ions whose net effect on the postsynaptic membrane is an increase in the net conductance..

   899:    63:    7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as amplitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
   900:    64:    9: In other words my conjecture is that the principle of 1/F in neuroscience is scale invariant and that it applies to everything at all scales. Essentially the universe consists of quantum waves and galactic supercluster sized waves and every wave has the same inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency
   901:    65:   11: So Amplitude is not always inverse to Frequency, but in the brain at the scale of EEG it is, at the neuron scale amplitude passes as duration, so the magnitude is changing, (the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.
   902     66:   13: What is interesting is that at the neuron level, when the action potential fires, the Amplitude is pretty consistent, it's so consistent that they gave it a name, the all or nothing principle, either the neuron fires or it doesn't, this became the basis of the Perceptron which arguable was the first model of an artificial neuron, sort of the base idea for all artificial neural networks that have been created since.
   903:    67:   15: So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?
   904     68:   17: With the all or nothing principle the idea is that once the threshold of a neuron is reached it either fires or it doesn’t but that it doesn’t change in amplitude. but why is Amplitude changing at the group neuron scale and not at the individual neuron scale?
   905:    69:   21: So it’s frequency is supposed to change without a change in amplitude, but there is an amplitude change that is being passed through the action potential as a duration of the potential, or the potential's decay time, or the delay in time for how long the action potential is open before it is hyperpolarized, and potentially it sends a message to other neurons by releasing more neurotransmitters but also it collects a receipt of the extra transmission with h
   906:    70:   23: However if the frequency changes, and the amplitude stays the same then the duration must change, the shape of the waveform must change.
   907:    71:   31: Light peps, or slow slams. This idea would be consistent with physics, that amplitude as duration or time cannot stay the same if frequency is changing.

   934:    98:   37: sparse quantum pattern learning/prediction is probably better for high frequency low amplitude senses, such as olfactory, maybe taste, but taste is also texture which is about high amp high surface area. smell, emotions, and point clouds have a lot less mass and a lot more energy, so quantum signals represent a sparse sample learning spread over a large area

   998:   162:   13: Essentially the wave form of the action potential by itself is a frequency with amplitude, but the multi-possible microvesicle release, with options between 0, 1, 2, 3 vesicles being released, depending on the wave form of the action potential, that means that both the amplitude & frequency of the action potential is being transmitted, in a smaller form, across the synapse to other dendrite computers.
   999:   163:   15: If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

(this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).

  1144:   308:   329: Okay. But yeah, I mean recent researchers like really have done have better.

  1154    318:   27: That's a like it's like a dimensional characteristic, right? But that's the amplitude is important for, for setting, for setting oscillations, right? For neurons that are that sort of set the timing, it creates neurons that, that, that can oscillate together, that's part of the mechanism part.

  1157:   321:    17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
  1158:   322:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

And in terms of like, how many receptors, how many sodium receptors, how many calcium receptors are active, how many potassium receptors are active? Because it's going to change, like the amp amplitude and frequency of the firing of the end, the fate and the phase characteristics.
  1165:   329:   39: Well, the phase characteristics are going to be like really amplitude and frequency which are in which are inverted. And in terms of like their proportions, so greater amplitude means less frequency greater frequency means, less amplitude, right? And this happens at multiple scale, so you have like this multi-scale temple, spatial phase space at the brain creates and the brain to text.

Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  1178    342:   19: That's how the group oscillation happens. And that is the zero point field, that's slow. Oh, high amplitude, and oscillation is zero. Point field and then what's estioned to that are like one neuron fight one and you're on like really fires out of sync, it doesn't just fire out a sink, it fires at a basic rate, that's when it shoots up fires.

  1184    348  b0232y ctpr.txt:
  1185:   349:   31: And that's going to change the amplitude or frequency of the of the action potential. So that's, that's an idea. I don't know what you think about. Yeah. So I like if you change the rest, like, let's say, you, you're injecting a current. And so one, one thing I meant to say earlier that my clarify some things, the some of the stuff I've been saying applies to really large cells, right?

  1191:   355:   27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.

  1197:   361:   105: It does it's gonna do not just frequency information it will do and not just amplitude information it'll do spatial information because the larger amplitude will have a spatial impact on the next layer of cells, but also not only that. But this but I'm talking about a true 3D neural network so right now we have 2D internal networks now a 3D neural network means that every neuron and every every neuros circuit so neuro circuit is several neurons linked together and went in you know, the whole the whole time window of a neuron when it fires to when it reset is going to be like 10 milliseconds.
  1198:   362:   125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  1199:   363:   133: And then but but, It's but basically okay so in EEG, there's something there's a there's a math there's a power lock principle called one over F. And it means that frequency and amplitude are inversely related And so that means that as frequency increases amplitude amplitude decreases and as frequency decreases amplitude increases.

  1203:   367:   231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.

  1206    370:    4: So, okay, so. What's really interesting was that I learned how the the sodium is causing a positive spike. The potassium is causing a negative spike and when the potass when the potassium engages that determines whether the spike is going to be it's going to have a high amplitude or a low or a low amplitude or in in what's interesting is that with EEG in the brain every there's a there's there's a power law from the micro firing of neurons to the macro firing of your aus circuits.
  1207:   371:    6: To to to the to dipoles at the super macro scale and so the power law means is the parallel is one over f which I'm sure you've seen before but basically what it means is that the. One over ass means that there is it's about the frequency and it means that that the the there is the the frequency is an amplitudes or inversely proportional so if the frequencies increase amplitude is decreased if frequencies decrease amplitude's increase, right?
  1208    372:   10: ⟪ 320 characters skipped ⟫ he's a neuroscientist right and he's he studies the brain we had he hadn't heard this one concept and so he's so he he was saying okay, so if um, More vesicles are being released depending on on the amplitude of the of the of the action potential then then then the story is that what if it's if it's if it's the result of k it must be.

  1212    376:   23: Of this shape because it translates because we're translating one to one if it's always the same amount of voltage or time interval. Then the the time interval would contain the the amplitude information and then contain the shape information but if not then if the voltage can vary the voltage rate can vary so you can have more amplitude or less amplitude in the same time window let's say it's like open for one millisecond exactly if you could have one millisecond but you could have higher voltage during that one millisecond, so that's but the point is that if it's open for longer then you can have more cows.
  1213:   377:   93: No fingers touching. So that's an example of like face or frequency or amplitude. It's the hardness of it. And so now you have three dimensions. We've got the frequency and which is the rate you've got the spatial which is how much contact and then you've got the hardness how much pressure or amplitude.

  1236:   400:   374: What is the amplitude of? Spank. That's also that'd be interesting to know and and so what I think will Katarina was saying was that she's successfully stimulated in her neuron almost to the point that it was going to fire so that it would you know, maybe that means that that you know, if it fires in a regular basis like a tonic frequency anyways, it's gonna fire just a little bit faster because it's even more ready to fire so when when the next round of signals comes through that that is going to be part of.

  1290    212    2487:    595:   32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.

  1352:    127:    7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as amplitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
  1353:    128:    9: In other words my conjecture is that the principle of 1/F in neuroscience is scale invariant and that it applies to everything at all scales. Essentially the universe consists of quantum waves and galactic supercluster sized waves and every wave has the same inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency
  1354:    129:   11: So Amplitude is not always inverse to Frequency, but in the brain at the scale of EEG it is, at the neuron scale amplitude passes as duration, so the magnitude is changing, (the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.
  1355:    130:   15: So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?
  1356:    131    19: The idea is that because of the All or nothing principle the duration of the action potential is more precisely inverse to the frequency. 
  1357:    132:   21: So it’s frequency is supposed to change without a change in amplitude, but there is an amplitude change that is being passed through the action potential as a duration of the potential, or the potential's decay time, or the delay in time for how long the action potential is open before it is hyperpolarized, and potentially it sends a message to other neurons by releasing more neurotransmitters but also it collects a receipt of the extra transmission with h
  1358:    133:   23: However if the frequency changes, and the amplitude stays the same then the duration must change, the shape of the waveform must change.
  1359:    134    27: So the idea is that when we have high frequency bursts the duration will be lower, and when we have low frequency bursts the duration of each burst will be higher, because there is an inverse relationship between the duration & frequency.

The time or phase difference between the transmit and receive signals provides the depth dimension. Passive techniques such as stereo cameras (imaging the same object from two different spatial perspectives) can also be used to generate the required 3D data. Finally, 3D information can also be extracted from monovision cameras through a combination of machine learning and signal processing techniques, although this is generally inferior in fidelity and compute speed relative to direct 3D imaging and measurement.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

  1440:    358:   13: Essentially the wave form of the action potential by itself is a frequency with amplitude, but the multi-possible microvesicle release, with options between 0, 1, 2, 3 vesicles being released, depending on the wave form of the action potential, that means that both the amplitude & frequency of the action potential is being transmitted, in a smaller form, across the synapse to other dendrite computers.
  1441:    359:   15: If the amplitude & frequency transfer does not include soliton waves, then at the very least patterns could still be computed at the network level, because you would have a situation where neurons could at least monitor the phase patterns of other neurons knitting together 4 dimensional pattern representations by themselves, but they would be distributed to other neurons through multiple firing events instead of with a single firing event. If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.
  1442:    360:   23: So imagine that a low amplitude high frequency phasic action potential spike transmits both neurotransmitters and a mechanical wave that is received as sodium channels open on the other side of the synapse. The delta (or amount) of the mechanical wave ought to correlate 1:1 with the delta of the synaptic transmission.

We find that the surprisingly rapid frequency-dependent broadening of APsyn is enabled by a unique molecular combination of Kv1.1/1.2 channels with the Kvβ1 subunit. Indeed, this small broadening of the APsyn mediated by Kvβ1 has a tremendous impact on synaptic transmission as the loss of the Kvβ1 subunit blocks synaptic facilitation even during paired-pulse stimulation without altering initial vesicle fusion (Figs. 4–6).” https://www.pnas.org/content/117/47/29937

That means modeling how calcium and potassium ions, stored in the dendrite soma, are changing amplitude & frequency of the action potential, which changes the synaptic output, ie how many vesicles are activated, and what types of neurotransmitter are released downstream, which further alters the ionotropic balance of dendrites on the receiving end. If one neuron is connected to 200 downstream neurons, when that one neuron fires, with varying strength, varying amounts of vesicle activation, varying quantities and types of neurotransmitters, how are those 200 downstream neurons affected in a different way?

Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex.

  1566:    716:   291: But it's creating it's it's it's creating a high amplitude but low, frequency a depression, a low frequency,
  1567:    717    293: Say LTD is long-term, potentiation, and LCD is long-term, depression. It's creating a low frequency depression, but the whole oscillator is tracking that in terms of the depression depression. So, the global oscillation would still like increase.
  1568:    718    319: Okay. So, but what is interesting, is that, you know, in experiments with, you know, like low frequency trains. So so they use high frequency to to high frequency stimulation to evoke long-term potentiation, right to evoke action. Potentials which have that's when you are going to have more spikes, more, high frequency spikes and it's going to create inhibitions I guess as a reaction to those bikes.
  1569:    719:   321: But when you feed the brain, a lot of low frequency trains like of electrical simulation like one hurts that that might inhibit basically inhibit short-term memories. In the sense that the low frequency is going to trigger higher amplitude, low frequency,
  1570:    720:   323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
  1571:    721    325: So the inhibition process and so, so going back to with the inhibition process. That comes as a result of the the action potential is going to magnify sort of like matte. It's going to innocence magnify the impact of the action potential on the oscillator, but it's an in between step between the action potential, which is it, which is a high phase, high frequency activity to the oscillation, which is a low oscillations, can be low frequency activity and the in between step, is that a set of neurons are inhibited the set of neurons that were a set of neurons that were connected that were connected to the firing order on that were inhibited to this.
  1572:    722:   329: Okay. But yeah, I mean recent researchers like really have done have better. Have studied LTP and LL DP as like basically, you know, the high amplitude, low frequency LTD signals, basically, stimulating the brain with like, a one herbs frequency, that is going to de-synchronize groups of neurons. That is going to not be synchronized.

  1576:    737:   25: Can look for patterns that are basically defined in terms of space and because of like which which nodes lit up and patterns that are defined in time and in that allows basically my frequency and and the patterns are also defined by amplitude because the the low frequency patterns have higher amplitude.

  1580:    747:    17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
  1581:    748     20: But low frequency. So I'm interested in financing but I also want to know if the way form the action potential is is characteristic of and information containing electrical patterns such as a soliton wave that would contain a wave shape. That could convey a tone, right? (it doesn't have to be an audibe tone, because it's in the context of information theory it's an information pattern because of the rarity of its distinctive signal relative to the tonic signals nearby. So it creates contrast in the mind of the brain that the organism's collection of cells is perceiving at multiple scales)
  1582  
  1583:    750    119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.
  1584:    751:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.

  1587     764  b0127y ctpr.txt:
  1588:    765:   37: So it creates such so it creates. So you can have a really unique sounding tone. And in terms of like, how many receptors, how many sodium receptors, how many calcium receptors are active, how many potassium receptors are active? Because it's going to change, like the amp amplitude and frequency of the firing of the end, the fate and the phase characteristics.
  1589:    766:   39: Well, the phase characteristics are going to be like really amplitude and frequency which are in which are inverted. And in terms of like their proportions, so greater amplitude means less frequency greater frequency means, less amplitude, right? And this happens at multiple scale, so you have like this multi-scale temple, spatial phase space at the brain creates and the brain to text.

  1592:    769:   23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
  1593     770  
  1594  
  1595:    780    12: And but like what I'm saying is like if power brands like are easily converge and oscillatory, dynamics and electrons are attracted to power bands, then the power bands might be serving as a, the power bands of low frequency. Oscillators like between 0 point to hurts and having 70 parts.
  1596:    781:   14: Like everything that's like below high gamma. So like low gamma and high and all the betas and alpha data and delta like those power bands are perhaps you're like low amplitude neurosurgeon set attract coop cooperation because they're low amplitude. Widespread firing results in neurons, that sort of like send a love frequency.
  1597:    782    22: So, there's just like, who's acting state are ready, state, which is like low time firing and then incoming, seriously are like fast drilled system and I'm saying that the stuff that finds our consciousness is the diversions between the high frequency, you know, activity, narrow pattern and the low frequency, oscillating of pattern of observing neurons.
  1598  
  1599:    819    11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.
  1600:    820:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  1601     821  

  1603     829  b0194y ctpr.txt:
  1604:    830:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  1605     831  
  1606  
  1607:    857    47: Why is sequence time? So there's a frequency. There's a sequence time.
  1608:    858:   61: Now, the way, that's the reason I said, waves it, so the action potential has a waveform, right? The shape that determined by an amplitude and duration. So has an amplitude and a derision. Now, it was a second. It has a frequency an altitude duration, the amplitude, but they're all that it's tied together the duration.
  1609     859  
  1610  
  1611:    865    13: So then you you don't get that first thing effect that you would normally get, what do they mean by a couple? Are they do? They mean that they're oscillating together at the same frequency or is that means the synapses that the activity in the dendrite is enough to cause the solema to burst on and it can go the other way.
  1612:    866:   31: And that's going to change the amplitude or frequency of the of the action potential. So that's, that's an idea. I don't know what you think about. Yeah. So I like if you change the rest, like, let's say, you, you're injecting a current. And so one, one thing I meant to say earlier that my clarify some things, the some of the stuff I've been saying applies to really large cells, right?
  1613     867  
  1614  
  1615:    869    15: So going back to oscillations each type of oscillation. I mean, each type of activity, is going to have its own feeling to human brain. The human brain has to make mistake. So with color, like there's a frequency range associated with each color. And so the argument is that the human brain has to make green green when it renders it and brown brown in contrast to green and the space in between his blue space or black space in between the ground.
  1616:    870:   21: The way that the greenness represents a phase pattern, a phase pattern is accomplished by the frequencies of light and so yeah. So, you're your phase in it. Your year on frequency and amplitude is a phase pattern, The frequency and amplitude is a phase pattern. And so if you have but actually is all right.

  1620:    884:   27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.
  1621:    885    33: Because okay, here's the thing. If you have in the supercharges medic, nucleus? Right? Let's say if I, it hires that, what what does it fire at? Oh gosh. I forget, but let's just say fires like you have 20 million neurons. They're all firing at the same frequency, all right?
  1622  
  1623:    898     65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
  1624:    899:   105: It does it's gonna do not just frequency information it will do and not just amplitude information it'll do spatial information because the larger amplitude will have a spatial impact on the next layer of cells, but also not only that. But this but I'm talking about a true 3D neural network so right now we have 2D internal networks now a 3D neural network means that every neuron and every every neuros circuit so neuro circuit is several neurons linked together and went in you know, the whole the whole time window of a neuron when it fires to when it reset is going to be like 10 milliseconds.
  1625:    900    113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?
  1626:    901    119: Right, you know all of this I guess but the supertiasmatic nucleus is super casematic nucleus it is about twenty million oscillating neurons, they're all oscillating at the same frequency. And most neurons are offsetting the same frequency, but there in but they're oscillating with a sort of temple which is called it's a.
  1627:    902:   125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  1628:    903:   133: And then but but, It's but basically okay so in EEG, there's something there's a there's a math there's a power lock principle called one over F. And it means that frequency and amplitude are inversely related And so that means that as frequency increases amplitude amplitude decreases and as frequency decreases amplitude increases.

  1630     905  b0268y ctpr.txt:
  1631:    906:   228: Power the power rule and the idea is that I guess you if you're if you're frequency is decreasing your amplitude is increase and there's an inverse relationship between frequency and amplitude though and if you have if you're if it's taking longer if it's taking the longer amount of time.
  1632:    907:   231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.

  1635:    910:   6: To to to the to dipoles at the super macro scale and so the power law means is the parallel is one over f which I'm sure you've seen before but basically what it means is that the. One over ass means that there is it's about the frequency and it means that that the the there is the the frequency is an amplitudes or inversely proportional so if the frequencies increase amplitude is decreased if frequencies decrease amplitude's increase, right?
  1636     911  
  1637  
  1638:    915     87: I'm gonna send you a spatial pattern with every with every frequency pad. So, it's like you get a frequency pattern. We get a frequency get a special pattern. You gotta okay we see this thing it's not us. This is the frequency pattern can also have an opportunity. So you can have basically the temple spatial and a face.
  1639:    916:    93: No fingers touching. So that's an example of like face or frequency or amplitude. It's the hardness of it. And so now you have three dimensions. We've got the frequency and which is the rate you've got the spatial which is how much contact and then you've got the hardness how much pressure or amplitude.
  1640:    917     95: What's interesting is that is that in the book? On intelligence, he talks a lot about how there's their temple patterns and there are frequency patterns. And. It's really a really there's three types of temporal there's frequencies and there's phase. Pair and the thing is like, okay, so. The reason those are different is because I'm sorry no this.
  1641  
  1642:    939     346: I I generate a compulsive behavior specific one to a specific movement and turned it into a compulsive behavior with high frequencies stimulation and then I did low frequencies stimulation that is known to introduce LTD like long-term depression and then I, Got that that compulsive behavior back to our normal level with it, so frequency matters for simulation.
  1643:    940:    368: The measurement of the neuron of the energy of the neuron. What is the are we doing like core screened measurements or you know, basically getting like very precise changes in energy and infrequency and an amplitude and and and so on I I want to say that there we can add more to what what's being detected in terms of like amplitude and we can go even in it in more detail back to Kettering in a second, but the reason what Katerina said was very was a great.
  1644:    941:    374: What is the amplitude of? Spank. That's also that'd be interesting to know and and so what I think will Katarina was saying was that she's successfully stimulated in her neuron almost to the point that it was going to fire so that it would you know, maybe that means that that you know, if it fires in a regular basis like a tonic frequency anyways, it's gonna fire just a little bit faster because it's even more ready to fire so when when the next round of signals comes through that that is going to be part of.
  1645:    942     377: You know basically but then the other thing that that Caterina said was that the the grant in terms of you know, the granularity of the encoding when you're talking about, you know, like first of all eliciting elicit illicitating a long-term memory with with high frequency stimulation and then generating compulsive behavior with high frequency stimulation, so basically making this like stimulating this neuron so they can basically or micro, you know, micro circuit or micro column or cluster of neuro cluster of.
  1646  
  1647:    996    1662: On the similar frequency to resume and maybe something will come out of it. So making a positive contribution. So I think that's a what I'm you know, in terms of spectroscopy, I mean, the high energy physics just recent days there's a so there's some you know new experiments from the formula.
  1648:    997:   1746: And but so like um in if we're gonna like if we're gonna if if I if we're talking about like just a matter of like so I guess my question is like just in terms of using the EM frequency range theoretically to just change the the amplitudes and the the the frequencies and the in the phases of RNA and DNA how what's the upper bound on the kinds of changes we can we can cause what what what can we change exactly and maybe the limit?
  1649:    998    1770: A cytosine or uracil or whatever. So we're talking about like with with EM frequencies, we're changing the we're changing the shape or the orientation or both. Just just the the shape of the frequency response changes based on the different molecules, so the guanine lava different response from agony. I'll try to pull it up tomorrow if you're on here or whatever next time on I'm on here.

The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices.

When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?

One long undivided moment in which the perception of time by the simultaneous increases in extropy and entropy because the two forces are bound in that they always increase together as the oscillators evolve in complexity they dissipate entropy to the surrounding environment, and the perpendicular oscillations of positive and negative electrons (an oscillatory splay state describes the difference between positive and negative charge, fermions are space in a state of decoherence, and bosons are in a state of electrical coherence with W and Z bosons being examples of high phase states that decay quickly by resonator dissipation into the larger group of oscillation, W and Z have too much energy relative to other bosons, which they cannot maintain, its like a top that is spinning too fast, to much angular momentum.

  2055     531    18: but the basic idea is that the patterns that can be learned are modality invariant, because information patterns are substrate invariant, the information is the encoded sequences of phase state changes that trigger novel oscillation patterns relative to the expected tonic firing rate of neurons, and the inhibited inception field defined by that neurons exit terminal,

  2097    1301    194: It's like, but but specifically, I am not arguing for something. Like what is the idea that the universe is conscious? No. No the universe is like a neural network and it's going to be sending information everywhere. And there's oscillations are going to go everywhere, but that's not the same thing that everything is conscious in the human sense on the human scale.
  2098:   1302:   198: So humans scale, consciousness is definitely like a very specific pattern of of power band frequencies that are oscillating. It's certain rates and a certain fruit. So, a certain well, rates rates is, is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.
  2099    1303    278: Like, if you are going to have like a liquid metal terminator, like every component needs to be able to function by itself and then it needs to be able to function as a swarm and have the information as a swarm to assume the the oscillation of of larger entity which is which is like it's plausible.

  2105    1494    321: If the action potential resonates a lot over time the growth can be a lot. A lot of energy can flow towards certain patterns, and those densely connected learned patterns (via synaptic connections) have a lot of attractive power (in the sense of being attractors in an oscillatory network) These patterns become memories that pull, attract, or drive other patterns to make connections. (like oscillators attracting & absorbing other oscillators)
  2106:   1495:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  2107    1496    341: I wanted to say that the excitatory/inhibitory fast wave ripple process that might lead to LTP in some instances and LTD in other instances is creating a multi-neuron oscillating assembling pattern, that drives behavior.

  2113    1695    313: By the charge concentration is changing. So so the charge in certain other patterns, relative that the patterns that have inhibited, those other patterns are increasing without increasing, that's total charge of the oscillators. The total charge of the oscillator, then can stay at the same sort of at the same, the charge, can't the total charge.
  2114:   1696:   323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
  2115:   1697    325: So the inhibition process and so, so going back to with the inhibition process. That comes as a result of the the action potential is going to magnify sort of like matte. It's going to innocence magnify the impact of the action potential on the oscillator, but it's an in between step between the action potential, which is it, which is a high phase, high frequency activity to the oscillation, which is a low oscillations, can be low frequency activity and the in between step, is that a set of neurons are inhibited the set of neurons that were a set of neurons that were connected that were connected to the firing order on that were inhibited to this.

  2125    1855      8: The natural selection of spacetime Wave Oscillation
  2126:   1856:    17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
  2127    1857     90: So that there is a growing awareness that if you have a brain that is where synchronization is being constantly disrupted, you have a brain because you have like you have it's it's only by encoding the synchronized pattern with decoherence or desynchronization or disruptions that are meaningful in the context of information theory, rare patterns among the common tonic oscillation. Does that happen? Is that carrier of synchronization, which can be thought of as the container of a soliton.

  2129    1860    116: In terms of like there is a repeating cichlid pattern there's a cycling pattern that has a temp. Is it a temple? Resonance or temporal oscillation? Yeah. So resonance is the decaying oscillator, right? Instead of a continuing oscillator, but the very, but, but the oscillator itself is, is it even in resonation?
  2130:   1861:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.
  2131    1862    125: So if you have a dissipated system, the oscillation doesn't resonate away. It's like but yeah I think of you know like something that is expanding contracting and that is the expansion contractions.

  2133    1921    13: The networking conversions points along with the oscillatory, convergences, the power band, convergences and other electromagnetic and chemical magnetic, and electrical conversions, and vibrational convergences. And like even the idea that, you know what, the, you know, maybe some acoustics, some mechanical, and some molecule magnetic, where's my reverberate off of the, the school back towards the center, areas of the brain and that, that by itself could be a sort of a tractor that binds together.
  2134:   1922:   23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
  2135    1923    25: I think minutute chefs it could be. I mean, I guess I guess it's possible. It's not super clear to me at how, but I guess it's possible that oscillators could be perceptive of, not only of action of the main action, potential event. But also of back firing action. Potentials then did it.
  2136  
  2137:   2010    11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.
  2138:   2011:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  2139    2012    25: Of a pattern starting to of oscillations that are having a cascading effect on what another that are that like, patterns are merging from from chaos face because of the turbulence of chaos resulting in accidental patterns, that that begins to develop themselves on functionally opposite to the second law of thermodynamics.

  2141    2056    11: You know, they sort of orbit, they sort of orbit, one another, and they're subject to the forces of physics. A. What if those tonic oscillations recording this 0, point field. Right. And then the face operate, the phasic oscillations were just etched that field. They draw shapes net field and that would render consciousness.
  2142:   2057:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  2143    2058    17: Is it like, very fast but very thin or is it very broad? But very powerful. I'm very slow, very bright. Yeah broaden everything. If it was broadens slow or fast and thin, right? And so yeah, the slower tonic oscillation is sort of like resetting the whole neighborhood, right? That's the, that's how coordinated activity happens.

  2147    2163     2: (audio) Neurons Oscillations Eyeballs
  2148:   2164:   27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.
  2149    2165    29: That's a small chain reaction, okay? But so that's like a neural circuit but that neural circuit might cause more neurons to like it's it might, it might cause a group oscillation like that is, that is basically, the norm of the brain is that neurons fire in groups of oscillations.

  2151    2200    121: It's a stochastic. Pink noise. Type of oscillation it's like it's just like a regular beat okay really it's like every you know, they're all gonna oscillate with the same sort of beat and it doesn't really it's you know, we think it we we think it doesn't really mean anything that all that significant it's just like this regular pattern all the neurons outside of this like regular pattern and it made it it's like it doesn't really contain it's it doesn't necessarily it's not obvious that it contains any information because it's just it's just a regular pattern just firing right but it gets interesting when I when you send new input data, what are you working back and forth yeah.
  2152:   2201:   125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  2153    2202    129: And the Kings book summarize all the the lower level books all the lower level research. These are great things. But but anyway, so the thing is that the, The higher level oscillations.

  2155    2209    141: That's happening and I think we're getting statements all over the place we're getting you know people who are saying well, no actually it's gonna be the recognition of any kind of data or any kind of patterns gonna happen at the multi-cell level maybe at the at the at the neural circuit it a at the minimal neural circuit for what information is gonna be detected is gonna be you know a yeah, you know, at least it's gonna be represented by some neuro oscillation that's like 20 million neurons or something right and then someone else is gonna say that well, it's gonna the The minimum pattern detection is gonna be a mic a micro column or a column of cells that's where it's for a pattern is gonna be detected and and some people are gonna say well no a single neuron can detect a pattern we've got the Jennifer Aniston on neuron right and so that's only gonna fire when Jennifer Aniston is detected but is that let me invite these these people who just arrived up so Daniel and Nick I'll invite them.
  2156:   2210:   231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.
  2157    2211  

  2161    2427:     8:   10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower amplitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)
  2162:   2428:    11:   149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
  2163    2429:    20:   62: a slower negative oscillation has high volume which is high amplitude

  2166    2432:    37:   202: spacetime is going to oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like heat death and maximum amplitude like the big crunch, but the maximum of each is limited to half or 50 percent of what space is doing, so like a Yin Yang symbol they are forever changing in scale as they exchange locations in space with one another.
  2167:   2433:    38:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  2168:   2434:    52:    95: In the real brain, spikes have variable amplitude and frequency, they are soliton waves, they do not collide with other waves and they do not summarize. In the real brain spiking is not an all or nothing event as it is described in comp neuro, and neurons oscillate.

You can consider the spike as a delta pulse (for mathematical tractability), but you can also consider it an alpha function with variable latency, amplitude, frequency, rise and decay times. You can consider neurons as dimensionless points, but you can also model the full dendritic tree with ionic current dynamics differentially modulated on each compartment.. You can consider synaptic interactions as current transients, conductance transients, transmitter release probabilities... Etc, etc, etc..
  2170:   2436:    61:   15: So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?

  2174    2440:    96:   19: larger scale memories would exist in physical configuration changes to oscillators as configured by LTD or large scale inhibition patterns to neural circuits in promixity to a neuron's phasic spiking event. The process of large scale LTD patterns establishes the cadence of brainwaves oscillation patterns reactive, bundles of neurons firing at low rates with high amplitude that are resistant to but responding to phasic firing bursts over spacetime.

  2176    2442:   124:   3: It can be challenging to imagine your soul as a computational space. However imagine you are like a circle in a fourier transform, like you are a combination of frequences and amplitudes from oscillating positions. Imagine you are like a cycle of neural coincidence patterns connected by a process similar to what AI people call "deep learning". So your neural circuits connect together tempo-spatial patterns and make predictions about future inputs. These connected predictions are the roots of thinking, and decision making is a motor response to these future predictions, that predict the causes (of movements) in the world. So in summary your brain is connecting sense stimulated spatial positions, frequencies, and amplitudes to predict the future and coordinate a movement. A computer can definitely simulate this process and so a computer can simulate a conscious experience.

But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.
  2183    2449:   258:   45: It's very robust and so I was talking about how in 2012 there. Actually 50 years of brainwave entrainment research. There's just a new article that came out was talking to recidente about this neuroscience news.com article boosting memory performance by finding the amplitude of brain waves in speeding oscillations. So there are 50 years of this, 50 years of research with with Rain Raven treatment, there's policy because hemocinked, there's the casino mine machine.
  2184:   2450:   280:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  2185    2451:   292:   480: That is going to provide a strong & wide amplitude pattern perhaps that will oscillate for a long time. That might lower the noise on the brains visual patterns, and the brains audio patterns, and all the worrying thoughts
  2186:   2452:   301:   323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
  2187    2453:   308:   24: You have like a if you have like a mega star megaphone, right? That's it's the principle of a megaphone. It's got a shape that amplifies, is it sound? It sound oscillates along the rings. It's, it's shape becomes magnified as long as there's and if you so you're increase the amplitude of the sound, it goes more widely.
  2188    2454:   312:   27: That's a like it's like a dimensional characteristic, right? But that's the amplitude is important for, for setting, for setting oscillations, right? For neurons that are that sort of set the timing, it creates neurons that, that, that can oscillate together, that's part of the mechanism part. One of the attractors of the mechanism of a group of groove, oscillations.
  2189:   2455:   315:    17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
  2190:   2456:   316:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.
  2191:   2457:   326:   23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
  2192:   2458:   332:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  2193:   2459:   335:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  2194    2460:   336:   19: That's how the group oscillation happens. And that is the zero point field, that's slow. Oh, high amplitude, and oscillation is zero. Point field and then what's estioned to that are like one neuron fight one and you're on like really fires out of sync, it doesn't just fire out a sink, it fires at a basic rate, that's when it shoots up fires.
  2195:   2461:   349:   27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.
  2196:   2462:   356:   125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  2197:   2463:   361:   231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.
  2198:   2464:   423:   47:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  2199    2465  

  2201    2487     595:   32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.

  2213    2533    106:   8: the non-magnetic part of the EM spectrum is gravitational spectrum, it's about the oscillating curvature of space, the morphology of the vector field that has been embedded into the shape of space as part of the expanding wave of a dense oscillating particle, such as an atom or such as a star, each of which cast a wave into space corresponding to their scale (volume), density, heat, and its kinetic & angular momentum

  2228:   2615:    121:    95: In the real brain, spikes have variable amplitude and frequency, they are soliton waves, they do not collide with other waves and they do not summarize. In the real brain spiking is not an all or nothing event as it is described in comp neuro, and neurons oscillate.
  2229:   2616:    128:   15: So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?

Tse dismisses the notion that consciousness could be quantum, because the brain is too warm for quantum coherence, (the temperature would scramble the "you" frequency). He also thinks that indeterministic quantum fluctuations could interfere with the timing of a neural oscillation just enough to make a human unpredictable to any machine that was not able to simulate or predict all the quantum noise in a person's brain. That's the boring part.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

What I can add to that is that you also have temporal scales happening in the brain with fast input activity from the senses, and slowed frequency towards the top of the brain's cortical columns, if we could use the analogy of the gears of an ancient clock computer like the Antikythera Mechanism to picture different gears of different sizes to imagine how oscillations from the synapse, to the action potential to the neural circuit to the cortical column, to brainwaves, existing as like gears on a clock, oscillations of different scales interacting like gears of different scales, affecting each other at different rates, which results in behavior patterns that emerge at different time scales with the larger gears near the top of the scale heirarchy representing behavior patterns that develop over decades. Then we can imagine what Dr. Karl Friston is talking about, behavior patterns that are time-scale dependent, and somewhat independent from short time scale behaviors.

It's going to innocence magnify the impact of the action potential on the oscillator, but it's an in between step between the action potential, which is it, which is a high phase, high frequency activity to the oscillation, which is a low oscillations, can be low frequency activity and the in between step, is that a set of neurons are inhibited the set of neurons that were a set of neurons that were connected that were connected to the firing order on that were inhibited to this.
  2270  
  2271:   2690     741:   24: Right? Because because you are like electromagnetically as an oscillator. You're sending out more of more of a spike more about like a more of like a high gamma frequency, right? It's there's more novel information happening. It's a 
  2272:   2691:    745:    17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
  2273:   2692:    749:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.
  2274:   2693     752:    11: At the same time that inhibition cycle. Is creating the oscillation frequency and
  2275

  2277:   2697:    767:   23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
  2278:   2698     773:    82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
  2279  
  2280:   2705     817:   11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.
  2281:   2706:    818:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  2282:   2707:    828:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  2283:   2708     835:   330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
  2284  
  2285:   2717     879:   43: There's a feeling, there's a feeling that is is actually. So you have this regular oscillator, that is exerting an electromagnetic regulatory pattern, that's observable. And if that oscillators frequency changes, that's going to be observable and neural network is going to be able to observe the change in the frequencies of oscillators and if that neural network was conscious, you would call it feelings.
  2286:   2718:    882:   27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.
  2287:   2719     884:   41: Now, the thing is, these neurons receive the each independently receiving signal, so that, so when I say they oscillate together, they oscillate together with what's called a tonic frequency, which is like, okay. Well, just for regularity, I'm always gonna be ready to fire. So I'm gonna be oscillating at a regular sort of frequency, just so I'm always ready.
  2288  
  2289:   2724     899:   119: Right, you know all of this I guess but the supertiasmatic nucleus is super casematic nucleus it is about twenty million oscillating neurons, they're all oscillating at the same frequency. And most neurons are offsetting the same frequency, but there in but they're oscillating with a sort of temple which is called it's a.
  2290:   2725:    900:   125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  2291:   2726:    905:   231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.
  2292:   2727     918:   105: Is what being transmitted is it only a matter of the frequency of the oscillation and the size of it because then you're back to two different patterns one is like how much like and that could be like that could be like a rich there could be interpreted as like force right it could be interpreted this force because there's more force that's being forcing as forcing the time window opens.

If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

  3925    212:   2487:    595:   32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.

So I'm interested in financing but I also want to know if the way form the action potential is is characteristic of and information containing electrical patterns such as a soliton wave that would contain a wave shape. That could convey a tone, right? (it doesn't have to be an audibe tone, because it's in the context of information theory it's an information pattern because of the rarity of its distinctive signal relative to the tonic signals nearby.

So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
  4012:    838:   350: That is very regular and it's a whole bunch of neurons doing it.

  4416     563:    4: The most important thing that I took away from the book sync is that it doesn't matter to consciousness whether our brains are dead or alive, because is its the physics of oscillators in a certain information configuration that forms memory patterns as decoherence patterns and produces sensor arrays to be conscious awareness. This consciousness configuration of the brains oscillators comes with a high fidelity sparse distributed time, space, tonic, phasic, and inhibitory memory system, that produces a distributed 3D phase field for learning coincidence patterns, and communicating & computing these patterns.
  4417:    564     6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.
  4418  

  4424     593:    75: The only thing it doesn't propose is the conjecture of this book that brainwave oscillations are information carriers, in the tiny changes in hz, variations in Theta, Alpha frequencies for example. I'm arguing that those tiny variations are not noise, but instead they represent attractors for encoded expectation patterns that serve as a baseline of consciousness, or a ground of being, a tonic wave pattern, that incoming action potentials with phasic & high phasic bursts disrupt, change, and cause inhibitory waves, that ripple from tiny neurons to the whole brain.

Our bodies just carry it.
  4428:    753:    23: In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and absolute time is equivalent to non-existence, or it is the infrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens. Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends. 
  4429     754     36: I am the phase field, emitted by exit terminal, that becomes encoded inhibitory neurons that create the oscillating tonic brainwave patterns that unify cell assemblies to recurrent waves of expectation.

  4443:   1034    15: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.
  4444    1035:   25: Suppose though that the void of space really was like a wave that never had an oscillation, that would make it a bad point in a harmonic oscillator (Bad Point is a reference to the discussion of Bad Points in Steven Strogatz's book Sync), or a point that has no area, or a point that is never occupied, never filled up.

  4498    1667     69: So that's why oscillation happens, equilibrium happens. Okay? So what I just imagine was the that basically, the neuron is Just so so oscillator synchronized because they're basically dissipating energy. They're taking a lot of energy that one of them receives just and each. One is like saying, okay, well, I need to dissipate this energy because a charge has built up.

  4569    2487:    595:   32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.

  4577    2495:    942:   193: So, if you want to read more about fireflies and sinking, I read the booksink and that taught me so much about you know what it means when and that neurons are oscillators. And that, then the whole brain is oscillating. It's a chaotic, chaotic oscillation like that. Like the book sync, really helps me understand that the computations of, of oscillations and that informed, the self-orients book.

(this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex.

  80: Another reference that I think supports the idea of a link between brain state criticality research & tonic theta oscillations and NAPOT Theory comes from this article below. In this article below they are using TMS Transcranial Magnetic Simulation with the TBS protocol Theta Burst Stimulation, to drive more activity in the tonic Theta Brainwave Frequency, unfortunately they think the goal to improve memory is to increase excited cortical activity in the tonic theta pattern "increase cortical excitability." which is a mistake, my theory is that the theta tonic oscillation absorbs & dissipates phasic spikes, (such as coming from sensory pathways) and synchrony is how the oscillating group acts as a collective knowledge sensor/learner. It's plausible that memory failure might come from a few factors such as flooded neurotransmitters (with oxidative stress, inflammation, antigens) and metabolic issues that may stem from diseased mitochondria, lack of oxygen, lack of ATP (from malnutrition), injury, viral attacks, bacterial attacks, diseases like cancer, or neurodegenerative diseases, and so on.

  212    2487:    595:   32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.

So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.

This consciousness configuration of the brains oscillators comes with a high fidelity sparse distributed time, space, tonic, phasic, and inhibitory memory system, that produces a distributed 3D phase field for learning coincidence patterns, and communicating & computing these patterns.

  1861     563     4: The most important thing that I took away from the book sync is that it doesn't matter to consciousness whether our brains are dead or alive, because is its the physics of oscillators in a certain information configuration that forms memory patterns as decoherence patterns and produces sensor arrays to be conscious awareness. This consciousness configuration of the brains oscillators comes with a high fidelity sparse distributed time, space, tonic, phasic, and inhibitory memory system, that produces a distributed 3D phase field for learning coincidence patterns, and communicating & computing these patterns.
  1862:    564:    6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.
  1863     565:    8: I would divide the entire brain into a series of fractal sensor arrays, with sensor arrays joining up with other sensory arrays to magnify their receptive fields by each adjacent oscillator they are tonically firing with.

  1867     581:   24: so the delta wave is an oscillatory pattern that observes changes as phase changes in its phase field, the phase changes could be modeled as topological patterns encoded in phase changes over time, sensed, detected, and enlarged by subsequent arrays of oscillating groups of neurons, which is why we have the fractal brain activity patterns being replicated on different scales, so the brain is modelling patterns in every modality for every perspective at each interval of time with updates being the fastest closest to the sensory inputs. In part because the energy of incoming signal transmission is being dissipated with distance as it enters the brain to the highest layer which has the greatest lateral connectivities for learning large scale patterns. but the large scale synchronization at that depth and scale is going to be best accomplished with the slowest oscillations, the delta frequencies. 23
  1868:    582    64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

   22:   11: To illustrate dots up close, of different colors, representing electrical frequency patterns to the next set of neurons, the next set of neurons are detecting frequency patterns with little drips of neurotransmitters that arrive in sequences over time to pass ions through their receptors, resulting in the occasional build up of charge with a depolarization or action potential event, that indicates a high threshold of a varying magnitude, that itself is dissipated in a multitude of tiny frequencies carried in lipid sacks called vesicles which release neurotransmitters radially across the branches of an exit terminal to the post-synaptic membranes of the dendrites of other neurons as a common class of brain activity to be an example. The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices.

   61:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.

   82:   17: When you accelerate electrons I would expect the frequency of the magnetic field they create to increase, but if that happens the magnitude of the magnetic field ought to decrease.
   83:   21: If the fabric of spacetime can be imagined as a single large wave, then it's scale, it's magnitude, and it's frequency are connected.

But basically, that's why I can say, we couldn't reduce an app in the abstract, we could reduce an abstract, the human brain to a field of tensors that are. I feel the face. Cancer face answers are tensors that consists primarily of frequencies with magnitude.
  107:   49: So phase sensors are. In fact, everything in space is a face sensor. In a sense, everything has a frequency in a magnitude. The magnitude is amplitude plus duration and there's an inverse relationship between the magnitude and the frequency. So it's not, it's, but when we think of like the brain, it isn't.
  108    53: It's, I'm arguing that we've the current model of the brain is one. And one in which a phase is is not not something that has a magnitude a sort of like started in deep in the magnitude of the phase is sort of discarded in and in the modern deep learning network.

  112      7: reference note a0221z.md on synaptic unreliability and search all the notes in this repo for magnitude specially in the context of magnitude in note a0089z.md which explains that a neuron passes its magnitude not through amplitude, but through duration, which scales up or down the number of vesicle sacks released between 0-4 with each firing of the APsyn

The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices. Since neurons are in a tonic firing pattern when they are not firing phasically they can also create dark spots, or patterns that appear as 
  246:    125:    7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as amplitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
  247:    127:   11: So Amplitude is not always inverse to Frequency, but in the brain at the scale of EEG it is, at the neuron scale amplitude passes as duration, so the magnitude is changing, (the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.

As soon as I saw this concept I felt myself creating another metaphor in which oscillating waves from other parts of my brain began to counteract the stress signals coming from persons in the environment. All of a sudden I felt at ease around people at Target, at ease around people on the street in SF, and at ease around people at WeWork.

  264:    430:   15: Synaptic inputs can increase or decrease the membrane potential, potentially causing an action potential that has a variable magnitude(duration) and frequency, that effects the membrane potential of another synapse
  265:    431:   16: in comp neuro, and in many AI models, they simplify so that all action potentials are equal, and they only take into account the frequency of the spike.but the (shape of the Action Potential wave, via its duration) matters, because that impact is going to determine how much the next synapse's membrane potential is going to be effected, which critically is going to effect it's firing frequency and magnitude also
  266:    446:   11: mass has spatial magnitude your brain is both setup to make and consider the spatial magnitude of action potentials in addition to their frequency

It represents features, right? learned features stored as synaptic connections
  270:    600:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
  271:    664:    43: So the key is that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast, and that's their (high magnitude low frequency) synchronization, right? Like the alpha frequency rate and disruption is to that are things that are events that all of the cells are going to notice.
  272:    673:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.

Is it is a, you know, zero is it was, it is its magnitude, like a zero, one two or three, because it's frequency like the zero one, two, three, like, you know, there's inverse relationship between frequency and magnitude, right?
  274:    699:   11: So higher frequency means lower magnitude, and so, all I need. So it needs to sound basically to each one of the neurons. And a second terminal, basically the same message which is, you know, I want to two or three event fired and so here's a bunch of neurotransmitters or no neurotransmitters.

  325:   164:   21: If the fabric of spacetime can be imagined as a single large wave, then it's scale, it's magnitude, and it's frequency are connected. 
  326:   166:   23: If there was such as thing as the ever present now moment, an eternal moment that was in a sense always the beginning of time and always the end of time, that moment would be like a wave of almost infinite area, but in exchange for having massive area it would be mostly devoid of recognizable features, it would be a void of space in aggregate, because of the relationship between magnitude & frequency in this fractal cosmos.
  327    170:   35: It's like saying that the void of spacetime as a quantum structure requires in the polarity of it's energy architecture the pushing out of energy valences, or diverging frequences with volumetric magnitudes as a consequence of it's structural formation.
  328:   175:   15: Synaptic inputs can increase or decrease the membrane potential, potentially causing an action potential that has a variable magnitude(duration) and frequency, that effects the membrane potential of another synapse
  329:   176:   16: in comp neuro, and in many AI models, they simplify so that all action potentials are equal, and they only take into account the frequency of the spike.but the (shape of the Action Potential wave, via its duration) matters, because that impact is going to determine how much the next synapse's membrane potential is going to be effected, which critically is going to effect it's firing frequency and magnitude also
  330:   181:   11: mass has spatial magnitude your brain is both setup to make and consider the spatial magnitude of action potentials in addition to their frequency
  331:   185:   15: both the mass/energy or magnitude/frequency or amplitude/pitch or weight/occurance rate
  332    190:   26: Also, the numbers could be off by four, even five orders of magnitude (!) and still support the idea that the majority of the brain's processing is subconscious.

  338    214:   45: So, there's a lot, there's there's a lot more to cover. But basically, that's why I can say, we couldn't reduce an app in the abstract, we could reduce an abstract, the human brain to a field of tensors that are. I feel the face. Cancer face answers are tensors that consists primarily of frequencies with magnitude.
  339:   218:   49: So phase sensors are. In fact, everything in space is a face sensor. In a sense, everything has a frequency in a magnitude. The magnitude is amplitude plus duration and there's an inverse relationship between the magnitude and the frequency. So it's not, it's, but when we think of like the brain, it isn't.
  340    222:   53: It's, I'm arguing that we've the current model of the brain is one. And one in which a phase is is not not something that has a magnitude a sort of like started in deep in the magnitude of the phase is sort of discarded in and in the modern deep learning network.

  342    228:     7: reference note a0221z.md on synaptic unreliability and search all the notes in this repo for magnitude specially in the context of magnitude in note a0089z.md which explains that a neuron passes its magnitude not through amplitude, but through duration, which scales up or down the number of vesicle sacks released between 0-4 with each firing of the APsyn
  343:   232:   104: the frequency and magnitude (via duration of calcium receptors being open, see note) to all of its connections. So it's connections are listening to a frequency and magnitude of the pattern that that connection represents so that connection represents a network of it represents. Like it's like that pattern. It represents features, right? learned features stored as synaptic connections
  344    237:   154: But but at the at the there's a potassium current gives us the decay time of the action potential, which is going to determine the the magnitude of the, of the neurons signal to other neurons, right? So it's this potassium rate depended potassium diffusion rate. So so here we have a potassium, diffusion rate that can produce basically, one of four different possible realities per action potential, right?
  345:   242:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
  346    247:   564: Charges into charges and magnitude so it's ultimately attracting and repelling in a sense.
  347:   252:    43: So the key is that there has to be sort of like a regular tonic signal being broadcast, and that's their (high magnitude low frequency) synchronization, right? Like the alpha frequency rate and disruption is to that are things that are events that all of the cells are going to notice.
  348    256:   363: # Multi-Vesicle -> Multi-scale Magnitude Neuro Transmitter Release (referenced in b0123y)

  350    261:   392: But it's because so the patterns can have different magnitude. That's important because it's like how much does this pattern resonate? Some patterns should resonate more than other patterns, right? Because the idea is like, well, what are we gonna be paying attention to?
  351:   266:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  352:   271:    9: What would it needs to send out? Is basically a phase that is communicates, the new speed of the neurons. So is it faster than slower? Is it is a, you know, zero is it was, it is its magnitude, like a zero, one two or three, because it's frequency like the zero one, two, three, like, you know, there's inverse relationship between frequency and magnitude, right?
  353:   273:   11: So higher frequency means lower magnitude, and so, all I need. So it needs to sound basically to each one of the neurons. And a second terminal, basically the same message which is, you know, I want to two or three event fired and so here's a bunch of neurotransmitters or no neurotransmitters.
  354    278:   236: It's just the horizontal travel with what, you know, that's like an orbit. It's like orbital travel, right? But it's just going to be based on the scale from the origin point of the oscillator but this the distance-based scale. So I mean, based on the distance from the center of the oscillator and the magnitude of the oscillator that's going to be sort of like this fading of of attraction because the line, the lions are emanating from the oscillator are going to have an increasingly less amount of effect.

  356    287:   74: You have four potential magnitudes of synaptic communication bits with micro vesical release you have you can either release. Zero vesicles, one vessel. Two vessels are three vessels. And that basically, for example might contain 2000 atoms of dopamine. Yeah. I mean 2000. Yeah. 2000 narrow transmitters that like don't remain or something and I mean if they add them so these are but don't mean.
  357:   292:   119: It's when it's or when it's decaying, it is cycling through the same sort of fractal pattern from the large scale, when it peaks to increasingly smaller scales that signal. It is shrinking. In magnitude shrinking, an amplification and frequency. But maintaining its shape is this until it dissipates.
  358    297:   9: # The magnitude of the wave, determined by Potassium (see Synaptic Unreliability article a0221z.md) is passed via duration (calcium channels open longer)
  359:   302:   82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
  360    307:   11: The idea is this, if the dendrite has 120 receptors, and lets say 9 of them light up, and the cell has response, maybe the action potential is triggered. Now the neurons connected via the exit terminal all receive a signal. The duration of how much potassium was collected affects the duration of how long the calcium channels are opened for, which transmits the magnitude of the AP potential to the neurons in the exit terminal. 

  383    410:   46: More than twenty years later after my Grandmother passed away, as an adult, I would find myself living in my Grandfather's house for a time, it felt like months not years, I don't remember exactly how long. Although I don't recall him mentioning the tv show "Get Smart" by name he would sometimes refer to me as 99, or Maxwell Smart's sidekick from that 60s tv show. He would say things like "with an operation of this magnitude there are bound to be some losses" and if I quoted him or someone else he might offer up the phrase "he said something like that" a point that would cause me to examine whether I was quoting someone else accurately, or paraphrasing them. 
  384:   415:    13:   149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
  385:   419:    50:   12: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?
  386    420:    51:   14: Magnitude represents the wave shape, amplitude + duration. If you don't factor both you are missing part of the equation. Neuroscience misses part of the equation.
  387:   424:    59:    7: I think that the relationship between frequency and magnitude (to include amplitude & duration as two parts of the wave shape) in neuroscience at the scale of brainwaves can be scaled down to individual neurons (as duration), scaled up to brainwaves as amplitude, and scaled down again to quantum physics (particle/wave duality), and scaled up to planetary bodies (red shifting/blueshifting, galaxies, filaments, and so on.
  388:   426:    61:   11: So Amplitude is not always inverse to Frequency, but in the brain at the scale of EEG it is, at the neuron scale amplitude passes as duration, so the magnitude is changing, (the wave shape of the AP is changing and the calcium channels are open longer releasing more MVR (Vesicles or lipid sacks containing neurotransmitters like Dopamine for example), though the amplitude might be the same or something similar to the previous times that the AP fired.
  389:   430:    83:   32: Micah: My understanding is that 1/f represents the inverse relationship between amplitude & frequency in the EEG spectrum of the brain. My question is, can it be argued that actually the inverse relationship is between magnitude & frequency instead?
  390:   432:    85:   40: Micah: Okay, but in the neuron itself, the amplitude of the action potential is thought to be fixed at the threshold for firing, but duration can vary. Since Magnitude is the combination of Amp & Dur, could there be an inverse relationship between Frequency & Magnitude at both scales?
  391    436:   111:   8: finally the magnitude of the APsyn is more relevant than the Amplitude, because the duration replaces the Amplitude in the changed waveform of the APsyn, set by mostly changes in potassium, affects how long the calcium channels are open/closed resulting in the number of vesicles containing neurotransmitters that released, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 vesicle sacks capable of being released, each might contain 2000  neurotransmitters, 
  392:   440:   118:    11: If we replaced the word amplitude with magnitude in this instance of measuring EEG waves would the ratio still apply? Can we say that in the instance of brainwaves as measured by EEG that magnitude also has an inverse relationship with frequency?
  393    441:   119:    15: (relevant to the question of whether we can replace the word amplitude with magnitude in EEG Studies, because the wave shape is really magnitude, a combination of amplitude & duration)
  394    442:   120:   116: calcium subtopics, amplitude, duration, magnitude, release

The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

  404:   479:   1639:    52: 16. I applied Buzsáki's work to Steven Strogatz (in the book Sync) work to connect Oscillations brainwaves at EEG scale to phase variation produced oscillations at the neuronal scale & neurotransmitter scale, and unified neural firing with brainwave firing via the hypothesis that magnitude is inverted to frequency at all scales of the universe, including at the scale of individual neuron action potential firing & at the scale of brainwaves from cortical columns or oscillating groups of cells. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0079z.md

  415:   523:    118:   11: To illustrate dots up close, of different colors, representing electrical frequency patterns to the next set of neurons, the next set of neurons are detecting frequency patterns with little drips of neurotransmitters that arrive in sequences over time to pass ions through their receptors, resulting in the occasional build up of charge with a depolarization or action potential event, that indicates a high threshold of a varying magnitude, that itself is dissipated in a multitude of tiny frequencies carried in lipid sacks called vesicles which release neurotransmitters radially across the branches of an exit terminal to the post-synaptic membranes of the dendrites of other neurons as a common class of brain activity to be an example. The radial distribution from the neuron across its exit terminal branches allow it the opportunity to reach many different neurons, distributing it’s massive starburst in lots of little packages to its neighbors, so that now its neighbors are receiving dots to their matrices. Since neurons are in a tonic firing pattern when they are not firing phasically they can also create dark spots, or patterns that appear as

  420:   539:    198:   93: Today I practiced imagining myself quantity my sources of stress as circles streaming out of people, and the quantity, frequency, magnitude & scale of those circles represented a quantification or the delta of stress from that particular person, from that casual body, this inner visual metaphor of my environment with people inside it provided for me, and for brain which I think of the environment for the rendered self and the rendered ecosystem a new program from which I was able to understand my sources of stress and my responses to those sources of stress better. As soon as I saw this concept I felt myself creating another metaphor in which oscillating waves from other parts of my brain began to counteract the stress signals coming from persons in the environment. All of a sudden I felt at ease around people at Target, at ease around people on the street in SF, and at ease around people at WeWork.
  421:   543:    260:    5: My guess is that a particle/wave is like a phase variance from the fabric of oscillating spacetime. In otherwords if spacetime had a default wave pattern, a particle exists as a difference from the spacetime wave pattern in terms of a change in its frequency / magnitude ratio or from another perspective a change in its velocity / mass ratio
  422:   544:    261:    7: as the particle/wave increases in magnitude / mass it decreases in frequency / speed. As it increases in speed / frequency it decreases in mass / magnitude

  426:   555:    293:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.

   11:    8: space is particles with either energy or mass, and the energy state is the frequency of light speed times mass, frequency and amplitude in the human brain have a 1/f relationship, as amplitude increases frequency decreases and visa versa.
   12    10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower amplitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)

   16    34: mass, density, and scale are 3 factors that combine to produce phase space fields that produce time
   17:   46: The question is what started the first oscillation in the universe? but perhaps its about the conceptual probability of a universe existing being split between two undecidable states, 1 existing somewhere like mass, or 2 being a frequency like energy, that is defined as an interval between two points in spacetime that it takes for something with an oscillation or spin to travel. 
   18    58: So the singularity moment is only an expansion of space from a point of view, from another point of view mass is shrinking instead of space expanding, but that is also only a point of view. Because the relative appear of changing space scale (space expansion) and changing time scale (which we experience as the forward arrow of time) is just space warping between two states: That which is sort of outside time, but moving relatively faster than space at larger scales.

   52:   168: because e equals mc2 energy equals mass accelerated, energy is a high frequency signal with low amplitude, mass is a low frequency (slow) signal with high amplitude

  207:   30: The relative increase in the rate (frequency or density) of mass creates the gravitational effect, because it warps space like a time crystal, in one particular direction (towards the center of mass)
  208:   32: It’s not space that is being warped, well it is, but more precisely it’s time that is being warped in space, there are more dimensions of spacetime where the frequency of mass is higher, and so particles and atoms move towards the areas that have increased frequency of mass.
  209    36: (for a full understanding read my other notes on Quantum Gradient Time Dilation, but in a nutshell the idea is that in open space the chances of a particle moving in any direction is random, but if mass is nearby, then the chances of the particle moving in the direction of mass are increased BECAUSE, the particle treats the extra time dimension as extra space area, and if you roll the dice, the extra spacetime area gets better odds than the areas with less mass that have less spacetime area. It's kinda like saying gravity isn't an attractive force, so much as its a more statistically significant spacetime crystal for the otherwise random movement of particles & atoms & objects)

Cells can detect patterns by firing at a high Gamma frequency ONLY when a specific pattern is recognized via a multiple possible path of near simultaneous presynaptic neuron firings within about 3 milliseconds of one another resulting in the recognition of a pattern via a phasic soliton wave that will cycle through a neural circuit being recognized by other parts of the brain doing pattern recognition.

  413    183: It's like the mass of energy. Now, it's like the volume of energy, the volume of energy, and really volumeless. It's a huge volume. The volume of energy is this vast distance? That's inverted to the speed of mass.
  414:   186: The volume of energy time of energy is inverted to the speed of mass. Does that make sense? Yes, yes it does. Yes. It is. Because what I'm saying is like the idea of math is that mass is much more slower and frequency. So the volume of energy is inverted to the speed of mass, the slowness of mass is inverted to this.
  415    189: Then, mmm volume better. Do the bridge and slowness of mass?

  421    300: But it but overall it's hotter overall, it's hotter. So, overall entropy is as I guess happening faster around mass. And so,
  422:   303: Entropy is like participation of mass into energy and which is like. So participation entrepreneur. Does that make sense and to this energy? So the universities either mouse or energy but the universe is really like, either mass or frequency or the universe versus either distance, or frequency, or the universe is either amplitude or frequency like this distance and amplitude.
  423    420: Having space time to it's putting a drag on space time. So it's causing space time to and be faster closer to the center of the oscillator and slow down further away from the center of the. Also the curvature space time starts from the center of any oscillator and the this the the mass of the oscillator, the combined oscillator.
  424    429: So that if you have a certain amount of space, it's positively charged. You have to have a certain amount of spaces, negatively charged. And so, if you have space contracting it or to be mass-like, then you have to them. Then a greater amount of area has to exist for space.
  425:   549: He can lower frequency and mass increase.
  426:   552: Actually, the diversion of frequency and and amplitude. So masses, the amplitude relative to the frequency of energy.
  427:   555: Is it masses? The amputee. That's inverted to the frequency of energy because mouses energy moving out more stories and masses. So mass is the energy.
  428    648: I still look at it, I'm almost there. Okay, but I look, it's like, okay, so you have. So in the case of, if you have two masses that are firing at each other, all right, so one planet sends another light. So, the light from the sun is knocking, earth and pushing earth away, right in theory or or something else is happening.

  432     81: And so the expansion of time is caused by my particle masses, right. And that it's that expansion time. You should think of it as time is like, it's, it's like, it's, it's fourth dimensional, but in this, right? But it's, but it could be fifth. Six, seventh, eighth, dimensional. I mean, the idea is that it's just advancing forward in time and I mean, like,
  433:    99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
  434:   102: Or as I say increases with increasing mass or decreases with, and increasing frequency,

  680    115:   25: I like to think of space as something that was created everywhere at once, and at every time at once, as if all of time is forever happening inside an ever present now moment. We are experiencing the frequences of time folding around itself in massive oscillators, and micro oscillators. We are oscillators inside oscillators with oscillators inside us with a fractal ordinance.
  681:   139:   23: If there was such as thing as the ever present now moment, an eternal moment that was in a sense always the beginning of time and always the end of time, that moment would be like a wave of almost infinite area, but in exchange for having massive area it would be mostly devoid of recognizable features, it would be a void of space in aggregate, because of the relationship between magnitude & frequency in this fractal cosmos.
  682    444:   143: c0069x/ a planet could be consider to be a fractal of an expanding wave pattern, one end of it, or 70x/ the point where the wave converges is the point where mass emerges

  690     29:    98: soliton gravity waves a charge build up represents increasing mass, heat, magnetic polarisation, time acceleration (phase increase), or time dilation (inhibition), inhibition is expanding space, white phase increase is contracting space, so time exits in inhibited space or contracted space because it is a relativity distortion in terms of how long particles have to travel before they reach their destination. so space is either condense hot condense cold or spaced out and neutral or something inbetween. However these things only exist relative to each other, the total heat and cold neutralizes out, and the total volume of space is the inverse relationship of time to space, as time increases space contracts, as time decreases space expands.
  691:    47:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

    40    24: sonce space is full of a fractal of oscillators, it would not seem to be a stretch therefore for spacetime to be a 4D interval between oscillations
    41:   26: in a fractal cosmos it would make sense for the relationship of particles to oscillate between a location existence in vortices ie atoms and galaxies, and an frequency interval that is expanding space relative to the oscillator
    42    30: The new interval of spacetime is caused by oscillators warping phase space fields and creating particle collision lanes. Space would be moving fastest at the particle scale, and at human scale time is really slow relative to quantum physics,

    45    42: If my memories are attractors then it means that I am, through my memories, literally creating myself, creating my simulation of reality, as the oscillator I am also literally creating spacetime, so each oscillator its creating its own relative space phase field, relative to itself, so it being smaller than its space, and shrinking as dissipative systems do over time as they run out of energy well
    46:   46: The question is what started the first oscillation in the universe? but perhaps its about the conceptual probability of a universe existing being split between two undecidable states, 1 existing somewhere like mass, or 2 being a frequency like energy, that is defined as an interval between two points in spacetime that it takes for something with an oscillation or spin to travel. 
    47    48: So if space is like an oscillation it goes from being all quiet to being all noisy and back again

    94    147: the observer viewpoint is essentially a mini hologram inside a hologram (space) we are each the image of the spacetime cosmos and fhe product of spacetime cosmos, and a dissipative system in the spacetime cosmos which is an harmonic oscillator in total, with space and time being resonating oscillators
    95:   149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)

   141:   9: the low frequency high amp power bands might concentrate or focus energy, attract electrons, stabilize and converge powerbands, merge small oscillators, maintain borders between some large oscillators, tempo-spatially synchronize frequency information across modalities, allow voting on correct representations to dominate and correct incorrect representations, or to absorb changes to representations in the brains models.

   173    90: everything is relative to everything else, in time space and oscillation phase, including in our brains.
   174:   92: the beta decay of particles is the decoherence of oscillators, its entropy, and its repulsion or slowdown in the frequency or density of mass, and its the expansion of space ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, reduction of space frequency (density)
   175    94: the fermionic condensates and bose-einstein condensates represent the opposite, the coherence of spacetime oscillators, the convergence of space, attraction, the reduction of space volume ~~amplitude~~ magnitude, 

   217    166: Space near oscillations moves faster and contracts towards those oscillations, but space in between the oscillations is being pulled towards the hot lines between hot points; they are hot lines because the field is being heated from two directions. These field lines in one sense fold space by increasing the changes that particles fall towards them, they change the configuration of space relative to each particle in space relative to what it's oscillating with, relative to its velocity, density, mass, and direction, they increase the number of possible direction each particle could move at each interval of its time, and so over time, because it randomly moves in any direction, it is going to move towards the space where there is more spacetime essentially, because more signals are coming from where there is more spacetime, 
   218:   170: essentially the frequency of mass is it's density per it's oscillating body ie it's volume
   219    173: because all of the oscillations of mass are merging together as much as they can exciting each other, 

   246    13: A dissipative system, like a cell, a brain, a galaxy or an atom is absorbing energy to maintain its oscillation.
   247:   17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations
   248    21: "and a group clapping is like a phasic clapper burst joined by other phasic clapper bursts until a slower group oscillation clapper event happens followed by the slowdown and cessation of clapping as the room runs out of clapping energy" (I must have written this part super late at night when I was really tired, I think I literally meant to describe human beings clapping at an event is somehow an analogy for how phasic bursts in the brain trigger and grow connections to other phasic bursting cells in the brain, but then eventually the energy sustaining the group activity fades)

   252  

   272    198: disruptions in the oscillator dynamics of spacetime could be caused by an influx of energy but also by an outflow of energy
   273:   202: perhaps spacetime might oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like the maximum magnitude of spacetime volume like the heat death of the cosmos, and maximum frequency of mass (density per volumetric area) like the big crunch, but I suspect it spacetime never gets to either extreme and is perpetually & infinitely oscillating alternatively between both states in different areas, when one area is getting crunched another area of spacetime of being expanded by the inverse amount.
   274    206: This means that there never was a singularity, there never will be a big crunch or a heat death because the size of space is relative to the density of oscillators
   275:   208: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between mass frequency (density & volume of mass) and spacetime energy magnitude, and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
   276:   212: but since high frequency signals travel across oscillators, in a long enough timeline everyone eventually intuits everyone elses secrets
   277    220: This is leading to longevity as being about renewing, protecting, and preserving the coherence mechanisms perpetuating the bodies oscillatory continuation.

   530:   14: The chemical properties of dopamine, serotonin, acetyl-choline, and gaba must have temporal effects determining the likely oscillation value for the group oscilation array, which is why gaba neurons tend to oscillate with delta frequences. This makes sense because the combined oscillator force of a lipid sack of neurotransmitters is going to cause a variation of some sort in the frequency experience that is transmitted between neurons. Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron
   531    18: but the basic idea is that the patterns that can be learned are modality invariant, because information patterns are substrate invariant, the information is the encoded sequences of phase state changes that trigger novel oscillation patterns relative to the expected tonic firing rate of neurons, and the inhibited inception field defined by that neurons exit terminal,

   533    26: The patterns are rendered and transmitted on screens (oscillator arrays (circuits layers columns and long interneuron networks and long glial networks) in every modality so that learned patterns are modality invariant and so that all the modalities are used to represent all the patterns (its different facets & properities) and its high level information configuration (the high level concept of what it is simplied, like object recognition rather semantic segmentation
   534:   35: the sparsity of high frequency soliton learning is good for modelling ultra tiny patterns phase changes in the oscillating quantum field, that potentially has memories encoded in the transformations of particles through different states.

   563     4: The most important thing that I took away from the book sync is that it doesn't matter to consciousness whether our brains are dead or alive, because is its the physics of oscillators in a certain information configuration that forms memory patterns as decoherence patterns and produces sensor arrays to be conscious awareness. This consciousness configuration of the brains oscillators comes with a high fidelity sparse distributed time, space, tonic, phasic, and inhibitory memory system, that produces a distributed 3D phase field for learning coincidence patterns, and communicating & computing these patterns.

   579    10: Pattern voting takes place over time which means that the connections between cells that fire over time change to result in greater pattern development. More energy efficient paths for pattern representation emerge over time, and the path is shrinking in energy use over time as the oscillatory network dissipates the phasic firing pattern.

   581    24: so the delta wave is an oscillatory pattern that observes changes as phase changes in its phase field, the phase changes could be modeled as topological patterns encoded in phase changes over time, sensed, detected, and enlarged by subsequent arrays of oscillating groups of neurons, which is why we have the fractal brain activity patterns being replicated on different scales, so the brain is modelling patterns in every modality for every perspective at each interval of time with updates being the fastest closest to the sensory inputs. In part because the energy of incoming signal transmission is being dissipated with distance as it enters the brain to the highest layer which has the greatest lateral connectivities for learning large scale patterns. but the large scale synchronization at that depth and scale is going to be best accomplished with the slowest oscillations, the delta frequencies. 23
   582:   64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.

   593     75: The only thing it doesn't propose is the conjecture of this book that brainwave oscillations are information carriers, in the tiny changes in hz, variations in Theta, Alpha frequencies for example. I'm arguing that those tiny variations are not noise, but instead they represent attractors for encoded expectation patterns that serve as a baseline of consciousness, or a ground of being, a tonic wave pattern, that incoming action potentials with phasic & high phasic bursts disrupt, change, and cause inhibitory waves, that ripple from tiny neurons to the whole brain.
   594:    78: "Frequency Is Critical for Spatial Synchronization and Phase Relations in Oscillator Networks
   595:    79: "if a pair of oscillators do not interact and they have a frequency difference, their phase-relation will change continuously with a rate determined by their frequency difference (detuning), a phenomenon termed phase precession.
   596:    80: "Nevertheless, this review demonstrates that changes of a few Hz either between brain locations or a moment-to-moment basis, according to stimulus or cognitive conditions, is a property of neuronal oscillations in many frequency bands. Moreover, the precise oscillation frequency can have profound consequences in terms of synchronization properties (correlation, phase relations). Hence, we argue that manipulations of detuning represent a key experimental target to causally infer oscillatory properties without strongly affecting other network properties. Advanced multi-neuron electrophysiological and optical techniques (optogenetics, cellular voltage imaging) in future studies will provide exciting possibilities to measure and target frequency generation in neural oscillations and synchronization during cognition and behavior."
   597     82: To go into more depth on how the physics of oscillations might manipulate information states, consider that information is not just a change in a phase pattern, but it's also a change in the synaptic pattern, and the phase patterns are not just electric, magnetic, chemical, there are also anything receptors are receptive to, such as mechanical vibrations, but the understanding the potential interactions of these phase based brain state transformations via the physics of oscillations will require some mathematical physics modeling.

   607    31: Neurons oscillate, create electric sensory fields, that sense the world like echolocation, allowing a nervecell to feel, it registers what it feels as changes in the quantities of positive and negative ions, this is how a neuron feels before we even connect it to the rest of the network in the brain.
   608:   33: its burst, inhibition, and subsequent tonic oscillation is like tcp, and like an ant colony, and like echolocation, its sending out a signal, and collecting a response, creating the feeling of expectation, shared by neurons in its pulse frequency pattern.
   609    39: The oscillation of a neuron in the brain is using quantum particles (electrons particles and waves) the same way tcp/ip works 

   715     3: time dilation oscillates, because spacetime oscillates, time is a wave, just like spacetime.
   716:    5: My guess is that a particle/wave is like a phase variance from the fabric of oscillating spacetime. In otherwords if spacetime had a default wave pattern, a particle exists as a difference from the spacetime wave pattern in terms of a change in its frequency / magnitude ratio or from another perspective a change in its velocity / mass ratio

The only way to break that annoyance is to realize it's a mistake, then a lower oscillation pattern will enable change that relieves the annoyance. When I realize that I have made a mistake, when I see that I am wrong, my brain switches to a lower frequency oscillation that enables change.

   752     11: Per the realizations I have since publishing my notes on the neurophysics of consciousness I think of myself as like a cube of oscillating brainwave patterns, or a volumetric phase field, I think of others as like cube shaped volumetric phase fields also. Our bodies just carry it.
   753:    23: In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and absolute time is equivalent to non-existence, or it is the infrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens. Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends. 
   754     36: I am the phase field, emitted by exit terminal, that becomes encoded inhibitory neurons that create the oscillating tonic brainwave patterns that unify cell assemblies to recurrent waves of expectation.

   792    24: Electric oscillation and coupling of chromatin regulate chromosome packaging and transcription in eukaryotic cells
   793:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.
   794    30: The synaptic events can be thought of as oscillators sending a knock, a knock that nudges the oscillations of other oscillators plus or minus in their own phase pattern.

   843    14: why do the coinjoined twins still have two separate minds? because their minds have different attractors (oscillation patterns that bind their minds)
   844:   21: If we artificially connected 2 minds together what would keep our minds from merging together? An oscillating bridge that never completely syncs with our brains oscillation. Hmm I wonder if each sensory input region has its own distinct oscillations that are mostly separate from the others spatially, or connected spatially but separate in powerband frequency patterns or both spatial & frequency segregation of sensory input regions except when synchronization is required for conscious perception or attention, such as when the tempo-parietal junction lights up.

   907: ⟪ 425 characters skipped ⟫ the phase oscillating pattern from individual cell level to aggregate brain waves at greater scales. Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly. 
   908    83: Perhaps then with this concept we can imagine that the ideas, concepts, shapes, colors, textures, feelings, and smells detected in the mind can be understood as emergine from a sort of Laplacian Matrix consisting of phase changes in 3D grid of the brain emerging because of Neural Oscillatory Tomography. If true, that conceptualization may help us to decode the contents of a human brain someday with medical imaging.

   955    11: so the atom represents a vortex in spacetime that is defining the curvature of spacetime which starts to fold over onto itself because distances in space are relative to the duration/force of oscillations. When vortices combine they create even larger vortices which creates even more spacetime
   956:   17: Seeing the particle as a phase/frequency in a decaying oscillator or resonator, its pattern is not truly defined until it reaches its destination, because of scale dependent time dilation the delayed observation of a particle can seem to define its pattern in the past

  1032    11: Techically the oscillation of each particle is shifting all the other oscillations in space, but somehow it's that one particle that it's entangled with that is affected at a distance.
  1033:   13: It's kinda like the first entangled particle has a unique frequency pattern <1, spacetime has a 0 oscillation in sum, and the second entangled particle has a matching frequency pattern to the first particle <1. 
  1034:   15: Essentially I think that with Quantum Gradient Time Dilation the particle field is like a clumpy energy oscillation, with the particle representing some valence of energy that is producing it's own spatial area that is it's frequency, but the point of an electron is going to leave a magnetic wave shape in the sense that the electron is like the faster beta frequency, and the magnetic magnitude wave it creates is like the slower theta frequency that higher amplitude & greater area effect.
  1035    25: Suppose though that the void of space really was like a wave that never had an oscillation, that would make it a bad point in a harmonic oscillator (Bad Point is a reference to the discussion of Bad Points in Steven Strogatz's book Sync), or a point that has no area, or a point that is never occupied, never filled up.
  1036    27: So if something is (at least temporarily) like a bad point, that means that harmonic oscillations skip over it, which is, going back to this idea:

  1038    31: suggests that if space has no real area, if the void of space is like a bad point in a harmonic oscillator, at least temporarily, then harmonic oscillations that do exist will skip over it.

  1061:   84: when frequencies interact their collective action is multiples of their components distributed over a vector field that is the representation of their combined frequency oscillation
  1062:   86: in other words the vector field of space time and the mass of space time are examples of two different spatial/temporal patterns that are the inverse of multiplying micro-frequency patterns that are multiplying when they oscillate together harmonically.
  1063    88: So at the end of the data the length and dimensions of the spacetime array in 3D and in time are stabilized in a sense by brainwave patterns, which are also spacewave patterns. The delta/theta frequencies of observation and attention actually entrain observed space in their frequences, like oscillators entraining other oscillators. However this means that telepathy, sending patterns through space, its inevitable.

  1156    31: Spacetime is a volumetric information configuration, and at the same time it is a harmonic oscillating field that is operating like a neural network that learns configurations the way oscillating nodes entrain one another. In other words information just grows in complexity in an open system. The oscillating nodes hit other oscillating nodes, like cells signaling other cells, or stars sending particles to other planetary bodies.
  1157:   71: But brainwave entrainment with audio can also help normalize brainwave activity, so the whole brain is oscillating at the same frequency pattern.
  1158:   97: Although I think I just came up with a hypothesis, which is that the action potential spikes are at much higher frequencies, so gamma frequences should appear first, then beta frequencys, then alpha, then theta, then delta, in that order, from sensor input, to the peak of the brain's cycling heirarchy. That energy drop in time represents a sort of signal decay in one sense, but it represents the oscillatory dynamics of a system that has changes coming into it (from the sensory input areas). The oscillatings of individual cells will knock on and ripple some perceptable effect (a phase shift in the tonic oscillation pattern).
  1159:   99: A high frequency Action Potential will knock the higher frequency brainwaves hardest & fastest, so beta waves preceed alphawaves in memory prediction with Neural Oscillatory Tomography.

  1262    138: So one pattern appears in this question neurons. And this the next part of that pattern appears in another brushing, your eyes and the cycle through the brain, where basically you have neurons that are that are firing and large groups that are oscillating. Sorry that are receiving bumps in large groups. And that is triggering certain other neurons to fire.
  1263:   151: But now they're going to oscillate to a different to out of out of frequency,
  1264:   153: like that group is going to oscillate and a new frequency.
  1265  

  1283    15: The brain's chaotic & harmonic tonic oscillations open the door for the brain to be actively receptive to changes in oscillation frequencies from spiking which creates decaying or resonating oscillations that ripple across the tonic oscillators.
  1284:   19: Each oscillating group (binds?) together within its own group at a relatively stable frequency (an example might be the Alpha frequency powerband, or the Delta frequency powerband)
  1285    21: A group is basically like all the neurons that are oscillating with that oscillatory pattern but you're gonna have some groups that are going to the interacting with other groups but they're not going to synchronize.

  1289    51: The idea is that if you have oscillators, if you have sensors that can oscillate together, meaning, they're all like, basically, like in lockstep. I mean, there's a very short great duration between when something that happens to one is then perceived by all the others.
  1290:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
  1291    67: The dissipated amount (of energy resonating from Action Potential Spikes into the tonic oscillatory fabric of the mind) is going to be very regular and it's going to be essentially multiplied across the entire collective across the entire sensor. So it's multiplied in scale but it's basically a very consistent tempo spatial pattern that gets multiplied in scale, across over the entire sensor away (over the entire brain & body)

  1301    194: It's like, but but specifically, I am not arguing for something. Like what is the idea that the universe is conscious? No. No the universe is like a neural network and it's going to be sending information everywhere. And there's oscillations are going to go everywhere, but that's not the same thing that everything is conscious in the human sense on the human scale.
  1302:   198: So humans scale, consciousness is definitely like a very specific pattern of of power band frequencies that are oscillating. It's certain rates and a certain fruit. So, a certain well, rates rates is, is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.
  1303    278: Like, if you are going to have like a liquid metal terminator, like every component needs to be able to function by itself and then it needs to be able to function as a swarm and have the information as a swarm to assume the the oscillation of of larger entity which is which is like it's plausible.

  1319  b0038y.md:
  1320: ⟪ 335 characters skipped ⟫ the idea is that faster oscillations might allow the organism to make gravity (quantum gradient time dilation) selective, so a message could be loosed by one cell and pulled to another cell based on frequency. Also it would be interesting to know if there is a measurable frequency to the exRNA message that corresponds to a similar frequency in the receiving exosome, that might provide a more specific oscillatory tractor beam that pulls specific exRNA sequences to itself.
  1321     77: # I mean to say that human imagination is essentially gan synthesis, or procedurally generated rendered patterns from neural activity bound by brainwave oscillations.

  1336    13: Although there are feedback loops, so there's processing and the whole like rain does, like oscillating loops, but they're still our directions for signals. There's signal paths, right? There are signal pass for voter signals. There's a signals and there's signal paths that sort of preferred to certain kinds of oscillations like they'd observations and hippocampus or delta pathways.
  1337:   16: In the talons Delta and we only have like the sensory input oscillations might be alpha waves. Going to have my wider which higher frequency.
  1338  

  1431     78: Then there's an equal chance. It's gonna go to every possible direction. But in the direction of space, that's excited because it's moving faster and moving through time because it's like layered with multiple particles, like instant condensate, there are basically more chances for the particle to move in the direction of hot space or oscillating space or faster space or expanding time.
  1432:    99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
  1433    108: And basically, these particle collisions are oscillations merging with oscillations and these are oscillations in space time. And as the oscillations merge, they effectively combine or they act as one, which would means that anything and encounters that that body of oscillators ripples through the entire body of oscillators. So they act as a combined sensor and information configuration sensor, but also a transmitter and then transmission between one oscillator and another causes space to bend between them but also causes lines to form between them.

  1463    46: And so they are basically because of the large oscillators are receiving, not knowledge patterns in the small oscillators. And because of the principles, a lot must oscillators are causing that energy to dissipate the causing the novel oscillations. The novel firing the bright and brighter and the inhibited to return to a ton of firing rate and they do this the way that oscillators work, the large oscillator absorbs, the smaller one, and gradually.
  1464:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
  1465  

  1489    259: The splay state means the oscillations are now on opposite intervals. The area between two oscillations in a splay state is going to be anti-attractive for (synaptic or plant) growth, or relative to the areas between oscillators in sync.

As we speed up or slow down time we increase or decrease the chances that particles move in any particular direction, thus teasing out a particle trajectory (between synchronized oscillators), which is like attracting the particle in a particular direction because it's just it's just the direction with higher spacetime frame rates.

  1494    321: If the action potential resonates a lot over time the growth can be a lot. A lot of energy can flow towards certain patterns, and those densely connected learned patterns (via synaptic connections) have a lot of attractive power (in the sense of being attractors in an oscillatory network) These patterns become memories that pull, attract, or drive other patterns to make connections. (like oscillators attracting & absorbing other oscillators)
  1495:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  1496    341: I wanted to say that the excitatory/inhibitory fast wave ripple process that might lead to LTP in some instances and LTD in other instances is creating a multi-neuron oscillating assembling pattern, that drives behavior.

  1514  b0075y.md:
  1515:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  1516    85: Basically this is the process of oscillators that are either moving towards you know synchrony or they're or towards it towards the synchronous phase state or sort of like reverse (splay state) or in a chaotic state, I'm saying that the different kinds of oscillatory patterns.

  1558     90: And you could categorize that as a as a display state or an anti-phase state. So basically that is like, you know, the space date would be an oscillatory state, where the synchronization between two signals instead of being closest together is now. The farthest apart. And so, his playstate would work disassociate two neurons that had previously linked together.
  1559:   102: Basically like a pattern that leaves to a state or else. So what I'm saying is that LTD and LTP are both accomplished with also Tory signals, and also it's for a signal, the oscillatory. Coupling and decoupling is basically like accomplished either through the mutual stimulation, or Hey, and also Tori is placed a which accomplishes like a stimulation frequency pattern and which is weird.
  1560    108: Yeah, I guess it's just an oscillatory decoupling.

  1577    256: Charting through the treading through the, the, the bed of the array of the oscillating field, oscillating, phase field trading the patterns through it. And So so that's why. So that's how I connect. Yeah. Like bootism and sprout dynamics and Ken Wilbur, but also Douglas hosted lyric and then and then I used that sort of say to Drake it argument that, you know, that integrated information, there is undifferentiated between the resolution of the textures in your consciousness and it and your consciousness off.
  1578:   268: What makes us human like what makes our minds human? Like is the temporal spatial frequency of the oscillations of these patterns.
  1579:   271: Of the oscillations of these matrices of patterns. This is temple space for frequency. So you could have the I should say, more than that, it's the temple spatial frequency of the of this circuit that interlaces different sets of of patterns together.
  1580  

  1657     27: But eventually it'll become very spilled as long as, you know, don't move. And so, that's what I think of, in terms of like, what is kind of like, why, you know, also tourist states like a move. I'm sorry. Why also store? Why? Why neuront, what? Why neurons eventually moved towards being an oscillatory state where there is because as a reaction to the action potential, it's like the action potential is just is a drop in the ocean and the rest of the neurons are absorbing and redistributing that way everywhere until it runs out of energy.
  1658:    31: I guess it's like now we went up like one point to voltage or something and so is tiny modification to the to the oscillation phase frequency and then that so that oscillations collector phase frequency is you know that is like that's a that's a brainwave right? The face frequency emerging from net from cortical columns and oscillators groups of neurons.
  1659     33: Those are there's a brain waves, right? And they don't and and they're reflective of the collection action of the collective action of neurons that are oscillating together. So I am arguing that those brain waves are containing basically. It's the oscillation phase changes are containing. The sort of like, those are the screens.

  1667     69: So that's why oscillation happens, equilibrium happens. Okay? So what I just imagine was the that basically, the neuron is Just so so oscillator synchronized because they're basically dissipating energy. They're taking a lot of energy that one of them receives just and each. One is like saying, okay, well, I need to dissipate this energy because a charge has built up.
  1668:    95: Yeah. So that would be like a longer frequency or larger frequency. I'm not sure how to how higher for, it's a higher frequenc. I think. Yeah, higher frequency. Yeah, so we're talking like hurts. So if if we're sending out so their height, so the gamma camera bursts, you know the frequencies of gamma ray of gamma vert of sorry, the gamma frequency of brainwaves because the brain can oscillate between like, 0.02 Hertz and 600 Hertz, and the high gamma burst to faceobok burst, those are high frequency births so tent.
  1669:    97: Tonic oscillations are low frequency verse. And I'd in the idea is that to understand the oscillation the oscillations tend to, like get divided into power bands. That are they maintain a distance between themselves of like 2.17? And, and it can differ a little bit between different animal species. How exactly what?
  1670:   105: And because well, when you get into, because the, when you get to the thought bridges, you know, the the thalamus is like this, this Delta firing circuit, right? And it is got it's it's sort of like you want to be in the same frequency range for data data data comparability, I think like, and I think you need, I think if if we one offslider is going to be able to receive and interpret the signals of another oscillator, I think you want some sort of like frequency matching in terms of the rate of information for it just for so that there's an apples.
  1671    125: Your it's something. Oh, sounds like you're just pitting information if that makes sense. You're dissipating information. And so if one firefly is patterned stops working like either like that, firefly becomes inhibited then maybe like that it has been eaten by like a frog or something in the whole. Also a oscillation is disturbed and it's like it's I mean maybe that means it flies away really fast like if there's a swarm and they're just hanging out all of a sudden like one of them disappears, they're all gonna notice it because they were all expecting to receive a signal and exactly the same time and they and they didn't.

  1690    287: So that inhibit group is not passing anything on to the next group. And so that is like a bunch of neurons who's clocks have been slowed. So they're oscillations have been slowed because they didn't receive something. And so what you have, if you have a bunch of stuff that becomes inhibited, all of a sudden, as you've a bunch of clocks that gets loaded and they get slowed and reaction to something that was moving faster.
  1691:   293: Say LTD is long-term, potentiation, and LCD is long-term, depression. It's creating a low frequency depression, but the whole oscillator is tracking that in terms of the depression depression. So, the global oscillation would still like increase.
  1692    295: And it's time in the timing of his firing unless a lot of unless. Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be because the oscillation is just dissipating. The energy from the activation and but they're still like more entered but still like with every when the neuron fires like that is pulling in energy if it does because downstream rounds are like take a break.

  1695    313: By the charge concentration is changing. So so the charge in certain other patterns, relative that the patterns that have inhibited, those other patterns are increasing without increasing, that's total charge of the oscillators. The total charge of the oscillator, then can stay at the same sort of at the same, the charge, can't the total charge.
  1696:   323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
  1697:   325: So the inhibition process and so, so going back to with the inhibition process. That comes as a result of the the action potential is going to magnify sort of like matte. It's going to innocence magnify the impact of the action potential on the oscillator, but it's an in between step between the action potential, which is it, which is a high phase, high frequency activity to the oscillation, which is a low oscillations, can be low frequency activity and the in between step, is that a set of neurons are inhibited the set of neurons that were a set of neurons that were connected that were connected to the firing order on that were inhibited to this.
  1698    333: So that's like at that point that group of inhibited neurons is not at like they're just slowed down relative to the rest of oscillation but eventually that group is going to cause the rest of the oscillator to pass their phase, to pass their phases around. So and until you know so basically like the slowed down neurons are going to.

  1810    30: You know, I think like a fan like destruction of shields, right? Where this where this, where the strength of of its attraction is going to be relative to, to the, to the distance closest to the oscillator oscillating, atom?
  1811:   34: It's also and pushing out into, it's it might, it's like, I just imagine that this the same process is creating vertical lanes, through through the combined oscillations of, you know, of groups of atoms. You can just imagine like a good like a whole world of molecules that are all oscillating at the same frequency that they're combined to fat is going to create like a thick lane of and I say they claim because like okay so like an atom is like a it's like a piece of space that has has been crunched together pulled together.
  1812    36: All right. And I'm saying or it's instead of saying it's a piece of space maybe we say it was a pizza. It's um as I think of particles is as pieces of space, but it's it's particles that have been pulled together and they're pulled together. And so, it's like you're taking a whole bunch of of oscillators and you're pulling in together and they make a larger oscillator and that as a as it has like a beam that that's like a bean.

  1847     15: Another are literally oscillations, right? Literally we are oscillating in reaction to the information that we perceive and novel information has a greater impact, then let them less interesting information. So it so if 
  1848:    24: Right? Because because you are like electromagnetically as an oscillator. You're sending out more of more of a spike more about like a more of like a high gamma frequency, right? It's there's more novel information happening. It's a 
  1849     30: It's gonna set the pace of the, of all, the oscillators that it interacts with, like, because it's gonna, but it's basically it's gonna set the face because it's basically bumping up all of their they're voltages a little bit. And so that's going to result in basically, and increase chances of coincident firing, like, you'll have, like, like you have a whole row of neurons that go off, just because that one neuron went off just because they were close to firing.

  1855      8: The natural selection of spacetime Wave Oscillation
  1856:    17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
  1857     90: So that there is a growing awareness that if you have a brain that is where synchronization is being constantly disrupted, you have a brain because you have like you have it's it's only by encoding the synchronized pattern with decoherence or desynchronization or disruptions that are meaningful in the context of information theory, rare patterns among the common tonic oscillation. Does that happen? Is that carrier of synchronization, which can be thought of as the container of a soliton.

  1860    116: In terms of like there is a repeating cichlid pattern there's a cycling pattern that has a temp. Is it a temple? Resonance or temporal oscillation? Yeah. So resonance is the decaying oscillator, right? Instead of a continuing oscillator, but the very, but, but the oscillator itself is, is it even in resonation?
  1861:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.
  1862    125: So if you have a dissipated system, the oscillation doesn't resonate away. It's like but yeah I think of you know like something that is expanding contracting and that is the expansion contractions.

  1876      3: Heirarchicalntemporal producer Neurons Oscillation O...
  1877:    11: At the same time that inhibition cycle. Is creating the oscillation frequency and
  1878:    13: But, and oscillation frequency allows the, the oscillation frequency is seen when you have, let's say that the gamma frequency is defined by the decay rate of the, of the inhibition of signal or the LTD signal and so you have. But you have with the camera, you have this sort of like linking or association or binding of different gamma patterns or cross multiple reasons of the brain that happened had some sort of coincidental pattern in temp and time or space or stale, or break or frequency.
  1879     15: And so the gamma oscillation is accomplished again. Oscillation is basically of large group and oscillator is an oscillator. A larger group that's firing together and it's the decay rate sets the cadence of the gamma oscillation the decay rate of the action of the higher phasic action potential, which inhibits in thereby neurons.

  1888    127: Become a tractors in the context of oscillators. And and, and usually you think of an attractor in the context of a harmonic oscillator, that is going to has a source of energy that's going to repeat over and over again. But in the case of the brain, you have, you know, the harmonic oscillators.
  1889:   129: And you can make an argument that the physicists, the high frequency physicverse are decaying oscillators. They're not meant to repeat indefinitely. They're meant to decay and, and the decay is in part part of how the the rest of the oscillator gets to learn a pattern but also be prepared for new patterns.
  1890    141: You want that to be a short time interval and by the same token, use, sort of want the strong white spread oscillations, which which which become encoded with various potential. Renderings grace potential, learn patterns. You want those to be in a state of sort of listening or expect or expectation.

  1907  b0126y ctpr.txt:
  1908:    9: Perfect frequency oscillators for a critical for criticality state, achieving a criticality state. That's not like,
  1909    13: Stink. Like it's it's these are the regular oscillators. And this contrasts and they become a dominant, they become donut and regular because care more powerful and more widespread. So they just statistically defeat the faster, basic smaller spread I guess we should say relaxed.

  1921    13: The networking conversions points along with the oscillatory, convergences, the power band, convergences and other electromagnetic and chemical magnetic, and electrical conversions, and vibrational convergences. And like even the idea that, you know what, the, you know, maybe some acoustics, some mechanical, and some molecule magnetic, where's my reverberate off of the, the school back towards the center, areas of the brain and that, that by itself could be a sort of a tractor that binds together.
  1922:   23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
  1923    25: I think minutute chefs it could be. I mean, I guess I guess it's possible. It's not super clear to me at how, but I guess it's possible that oscillators could be perceptive of, not only of action of the main action, potential event. But also of back firing action. Potentials then did it.

  1928     35: I'm trying to say that long stretches of monotonic sounds, have meaning, long & slow meaning. Our cells, our body mind and voice are entified, bound, compounded, unified, assembled, by oscillation, by cells firing together in close synchrony. 
  1929:    82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
  1930:    84: If you have incoming Sensory Signals that were much more sparse, in terms of their area effect, like single spikes instead of big oscillating groups, and these single spikes were distinguished with a much higher frequency (relative to the tonic pace of the oscillating group) then you are beginning to describe the situation in the brain where the oscillating group of cells can detect the novel firing patterns that represent memories, because those neurons that fired reset the pace of the group of neurons that were inhibited by the firing of that one neuron.
  1931     95: Coincidence patterns are learned by the whole group of cells (the cell assembling that oscillates as a unit), but expressed by a few of them at a time, you could have bottom up incoming sensor activity helping to trigger learned information patterns accessible in any combination of cells that are assembled via the physics of oscillation, united by oscillation to learn as a group, like many cells becoming one sensory consideration & action device. Patterns at the micro level of individual cells trigger their network when they fire, triggering mesoscale & macroscale pattern reactions.

  1937    117: So they will maintain boundaries between oscillators. Imagine you have star systems interacting, sometimes two stars will orbit each other, sometimes a star that's flying through the sky that can affect the gravity of another star, and sometimes you have two stars rotating around each other.
  1938: ⟪ 410 characters skipped ⟫ planet or star is actually a particle, and that particle is actually a wave, or the planet is the tip of a wave that is expanding into space and creating time & space that is a wave, or a macroscopy frequency.
  1939    129: Each planetary body, or star has enough of a time dilation area effect to disturb or offset or mess with other oscillators other planets & stars, and cause and stimulate other oscillators to maintain alternative oscillating paths.

  1941  b0132y ctpr.txt:
  1942:   12: And but like what I'm saying is like if power brands like are easily converge and oscillatory, dynamics and electrons are attracted to power bands, then the power bands might be serving as a, the power bands of low frequency. Oscillators like between 0 point to hurts and having 70 parts.
  1943:   22: So, there's just like, who's acting state are ready, state, which is like low time firing and then incoming, seriously are like fast drilled system and I'm saying that the stuff that finds our consciousness is the diversions between the high frequency, you know, activity, narrow pattern and the low frequency, oscillating of pattern of observing neurons.
  1944    24: And that interaction is at six. Like the interaction is what prints. That's where that's where the canvas of consciousness is printed, and it's what it's printed with, and oscillators with their own physic with physical iron and also, you know, and and also inhibitor patterns, right? And habit for variations.
  1945    36: We're just computer graphics related to religion, right? Yeah. So there's there's a potential buying agency advanty because oscillators are oscillating. Power bands are going to attract information together. So information is going to two verge. So you have multiple representations, or multiple viewpoints, or multiple renderings, in the same out of the multiple side, and those multiple representations, in a sense, get to vote as they converge because the, there's the thing that there is more instances of has a greater likely or something that is fewer answers to suffering.
  1946:   44: But oscillator itself is going to insert a sort of attraction to pulling that smaller. Oscillating, neuron back into the same tonic frequency flow, I just ready for being ready for a phase of firing. So the phase of firing to be cold for, but it happens because of physics the physics and oscillators and oscillation is sort of like
  1947    56: I mean, the idea I guess is that power power bands and spectra could be not only just, you know, converging information. I guess the exercise I could symbolize work, converging information. If an oscillator is collectively, reading out a face, a temple, spatial phase pattern, coinc at the same time that it is being absorbed by the by basically.

  1949  b0134y ctpr.txt:
  1950: ⟪ 415 characters skipped ⟫ a ton of firing phase, which is like the standard expectation and like of being, like, in the, that's when neurons are fine together in large groups in oscillators, and it's like a slower, you know, frequency fine pattern during the day, you might have like the power band of your alpha, oscillating layers might be greatest during the day.
  1951  

  1980  b0155y ctpr.txt:
  1981:   16: So it's able to send but it doesn't send us alternate, but I think perhaps it doesn't send us all it's underway to other neurons. This end of the nerve, transmitters instead. And then there are transmitters are transmitted in timing. All right, so that's carrying the type of frequency of how of our frequency is carving dot matrix and the oscillator, right?
  1982    18: Whether it's inhibited or excited, that's covering the dot metrics and the oscillators. The frequencies of the neurons doing, is that? That's where the awareness of coming from, but the sultan waves are passing signals. Maybe to from muscles. But anyway, it allows the neuron to send signals not between neurons but over but just over a legal denture sites.

  2009     9: Because because the fingers, the fingers are ultimately made out of atoms and atoms are mostly empty space. The one, the one thing that that an atom does that helps provide structure is it's sort of creates its own density, and it's moving very fast. It's oscillating. Very fast is in a sense.
  2010:   11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.
  2011:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  2012    25: Of a pattern starting to of oscillations that are having a cascading effect on what another that are that like, patterns are merging from from chaos face because of the turbulence of chaos resulting in accidental patterns, that that begins to develop themselves on functionally opposite to the second law of thermodynamics.

  2056    11: You know, they sort of orbit, they sort of orbit, one another, and they're subject to the forces of physics. A. What if those tonic oscillations recording this 0, point field. Right. And then the face operate, the phasic oscillations were just etched that field. They draw shapes net field and that would render consciousness.
  2057:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  2058    17: Is it like, very fast but very thin or is it very broad? But very powerful. I'm very slow, very bright. Yeah broaden everything. If it was broadens slow or fast and thin, right? And so yeah, the slower tonic oscillation is sort of like resetting the whole neighborhood, right? That's the, that's how coordinated activity happens.

  2069    320: It's measured. The EG starts to synchronize because they're both on the same wavelength during that conversation. And and so the oscillation see this is, this is the key. I think it is that for not, a neuron is not just a receiver or center of information. It's also transmitter information.
  2070:   330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
  2071    332: It dissipates. So the next sound period. All right, so it's it's a it's designed to the hidden piano key boom. There's got to fade out. So the oscillation pulls it down, but the oscillation itself by pulling it down, means that every other neuron in the oscillation is noticing it.

  2079    423: You tell this was quite different from the previous representation of a cat, okay? And, and so, you can have the same sort of neurons that fired the same odds. The same oscillatory network that fired to represent a cat. Has now been changed because of inter neurons because it does though they're they're causing inhibitory changes and how the signals are flowing and that same oscillator how the signals are flowing in that moment so that that that the pattern has merging where in area where the cat was is now no longer no longer representing a cat pattern and representing a bunny pattern or rabbit pattern with a ram.
  2080:   473: It's assault and waves. You can have a lot of different basic patterns happening. There are such they're so high frequency that they're sort of like impacting the slower frequency. Tonic wave oscillations and a big way like like the I think the faster faster frequencies are cause all of the slower frequencies pay attention because then because there is this sort of like, you know, there's this so we oscillators work.
  2081    475: Is that, you know the that's the those things. There's like the principles of oscillators of the physics of oscillators not just in the brain, but the physics of oscillators apply to the brain. And so, you know, you can have a phase of signal, a magnetic solution wave, basic signal oscillator.

  2100    25: Capturing frames brain. Frames are oscillations. It's like one tray and two frames a friend, 30 frames per second. How many also lesions per second? The frame? But it's, but it's actually like, yeah. No. Every single neuron is doing oscillation and then larger. And then at the mesoscale, you have many have groups of neurons that are bound together in a single oscillation.
  2101:   29: Now you say well now wait a second. If if whatever you feed individual neurons gets wiped out. Because here's his thing is, we're thinking there's this thing. There's this idea that wait a second, the oscillation itself. How could it represent? Complex information. It's all the same that you have, like, that's like you all these neurons are that are, how could the frequency, say, the group of neurons?
  2102    33: They're making this oscillation because how could it have information in it, right? Because their own scene, it's not. It doesn't appear to be distinct. And the other thing is like, yeah, so if the activity to a neuron changes, okay? So the neuron changes but so you get an ax you get and then it's gonna fire anyways.
  2103:   41: Out of its normal oscillatory, frequency the rest of the oscillation resets it. So there's this whole like that just hold like neurophysics thing where we have to talk about the physics of brain, waves and tendrides and There are transmitters and I think that there's a lot of stuff to mention, but we can kind of get a framework out of it.
  2104  

  2121  b0232y ctpr.txt:
  2122:   13: So then you you don't get that first thing effect that you would normally get, what do they mean by a couple? Are they do? They mean that they're oscillating together at the same frequency or is that means the synapses that the activity in the dendrite is enough to cause the solema to burst on and it can go the other way.
  2123  
  2124  b0233y ctpr.txt:
  2125:   15: So going back to oscillations each type of oscillation. I mean, each type of activity, is going to have its own feeling to human brain. The human brain has to make mistake. So with color, like there's a frequency range associated with each color. And so the argument is that the human brain has to make green green when it renders it and brown brown in contrast to green and the space in between his blue space or black space in between the ground.
  2126    31: Yes. Yeah and going back to oscillations and okay. So going back to medicine so you have so you see patients do you see patients with Alzheimer's? Do you work in neurology at all with Alzheimer's or patients with Parkinson's? What you're it. Surgery. Not but not neurosurgery. Just, what would?

  2128  b0234y ctpr.txt:
  2129:   29: And so, what I'm saying, what I'm talking about right now is the is the EEG think the EG frequency range synchronization between two speakers when two human beings get together and talk? There is a sort of synchronization in their tonic oscillation, which is in the EEG. Frequency spectrum. So you can see that they are synchronizing while they are communicating.
  2130    49: I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so because the idea is and we'll do it in such a way that they're oscillating like from one from, from a person that has an alpha way of to a person, has a dealt with who person has enough way to person's delta wave, like they're gonna psycho through like so you have six people.

  2135    83: So not only like or 60, but they go from 40 to 200 and people in the department were saying. Yeah, you can order that ignore that is oscillations but I was not so convinced. So I started to talk to many people in the world. And in the end, I was the one who convinced or single also that these are not God.
  2136:   87: I say just to complete that topic. So these higher frequency oscillations, call them demo or let's say everything over 40, hrs. Do you do sort of see how well for them? Get anything, but some people say it's helping the binding problem. It's is part of amplifying signals between cortical areas other things.
  2137    89: Yeah, me definitely after my, my group on that I do think that there is a lot of high around dissociation and this was even more intense like 10 years ago like maybe there was still single autism things about cam oscillations but then there was this new generation of researchers including me.

  2146    29: Let's say the groups neurons system is oscillating at 20 hertz. Okay? And then you have what you have is you have a red shirt and the red shirt cost us a small number of neurons to have an oscillation deviation of approximately three milliseconds. So they become three milliseconds out of sync with the oscillating hole now, because the oscillator has to, there has to be an equilibrium between the neurons that that were two or three milliseconds out of sync with the normal oscillation and the normal oscillation.
  2147:   31: So, what happens is that you use two different oscillating. Energies. When you have an author, they have to combine In the act of them, combining is causing the hold network, as a whole, to recognize an individual event. Because the act of, of changing your electrodynamics to match the new, my new change in the oscillation frequency, because it is a new change.
  2148    33: It's what I'm arguing is, I'm arguing that when an oscillating when oscillator gets out of sync, right? Because of a trigger. The whole oscillator. Brings it into sync again, but the the, the journey. So what I'm saying is like, in order for that to come and sink, you have to have energy in the higher oscillator that's dripping down into the lower oscillator.

  2152    41: It doesn't really have to change because just a fact that you have you have something. It's like it's gonna be like, it's gonna feel like there's a magnet, right? That's exerting. An electromagnetic force on the things around it. That's what it's going to feel. Like for the austers. The oscillator knows.
  2153:   43: There's a feeling, there's a feeling that is is actually. So you have this regular oscillator, that is exerting an electromagnetic regulatory pattern, that's observable. And if that oscillators frequency changes, that's going to be observable and neural network is going to be able to observe the change in the frequencies of oscillators and if that neural network was conscious, you would call it feelings.
  2154  

  2163     2: (audio) Neurons Oscillations Eyeballs
  2164:   27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.
  2165    29: That's a small chain reaction, okay? But so that's like a neural circuit but that neural circuit might cause more neurons to like it's it might, it might cause a group oscillation like that is, that is basically, the norm of the brain is that neurons fire in groups of oscillations.

  2169    39: It. I mean, it's not like there's no for, it's like there's no forms and structures inside the brain. There's a structure of oscillations, okay? And and that means that the supercharges super charismatic. Nucleus is one of the structures of oscillations because it is specifically, a group of 20 million neurons that all oscillate together.
  2170:   41: Now, the thing is, these neurons receive the each independently receiving signal, so that, so when I say they oscillate together, they oscillate together with what's called a tonic frequency, which is like, okay. Well, just for regularity, I'm always gonna be ready to fire. So I'm gonna be oscillating at a regular sort of frequency, just so I'm always ready.
  2171:   43: This is my ready for. Is my ready, frequency? I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. And it's a group oscillation. It's a big group of neurons that are oscillating. Okay, and then what's gonna happen then is this this bigger oscillation is going to create. It's going to influence the, the electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field of the entire brain, because it's bigger, because it's bigger than one neuron.
  2172    45: So you have a group and there their wheel. There's that an actual electromagnetic force, that is pushing through the brain and this oscillation this electromagnetic wave that's oscillating. And if which is means it's it's it goes on and through cycles, like a heartbeat like a heartbeat, just think of a heartbeat is oscillation is like a heartbeat of electromagnetism.

  2190     79: Okay. So what I'm imagining is that God damn it. I'm imagining that. So you've got your multiple frames out in a sequence. Okay. And okay. See. All right. But what happens is you also have fact that you can have oscillations like effect oscillations that are temporary that are temporarily distal.
  2191:    81: So that could mean that you have an oscillation that where, okay? So let's say that you have like an offer frequency oscillation that has a certain pattern that is that has special and turnable characteristics that are you unique identifiers for a specific pattern. They represent maybe they represent a flower, okay?
  2192     91: And then so you have a blue oscillation like that where they were your approaching like where something trick like a sequence begins and you know that at the end of the sequence, the yellow flower you can appear or you know that's the yellow flower might appear. Like so then what happens is the sequence begins.

  2196      3: My book Neurons Oscillations Dendrite 
  2197:    65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
  2198:   113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?
  2199:   119: Right, you know all of this I guess but the supertiasmatic nucleus is super casematic nucleus it is about twenty million oscillating neurons, they're all oscillating at the same frequency. And most neurons are offsetting the same frequency, but there in but they're oscillating with a sort of temple which is called it's a.
  2200    121: It's a stochastic. Pink noise. Type of oscillation it's like it's just like a regular beat okay really it's like every you know, they're all gonna oscillate with the same sort of beat and it doesn't really it's you know, we think it we we think it doesn't really mean anything that all that significant it's just like this regular pattern all the neurons outside of this like regular pattern and it made it it's like it doesn't really contain it's it doesn't necessarily it's not obvious that it contains any information because it's just it's just a regular pattern just firing right but it gets interesting when I when you send new input data, what are you working back and forth yeah.
  2201:   125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  2202    129: And the Kings book summarize all the the lower level books all the lower level research. These are great things. But but anyway, so the thing is that the, The higher level oscillations.

  2209    141: That's happening and I think we're getting statements all over the place we're getting you know people who are saying well, no actually it's gonna be the recognition of any kind of data or any kind of patterns gonna happen at the multi-cell level maybe at the at the at the neural circuit it a at the minimal neural circuit for what information is gonna be detected is gonna be you know a yeah, you know, at least it's gonna be represented by some neuro oscillation that's like 20 million neurons or something right and then someone else is gonna say that well, it's gonna the The minimum pattern detection is gonna be a mic a micro column or a column of cells that's where it's for a pattern is gonna be detected and and some people are gonna say well no a single neuron can detect a pattern we've got the Jennifer Aniston on neuron right and so that's only gonna fire when Jennifer Aniston is detected but is that let me invite these these people who just arrived up so Daniel and Nick I'll invite them.
  2210:   231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.

  2261:    71: I think that would it wouldn't necessarily cause your brain to go out of control but but it might change the the oscillation frequency of your. Of your. Of your brain rhythms which which would be interesting but I but I just wanted to sort of dial down on that and in just ask you if you really know if it's not possible to like for neural length specifically to reduce the amount of electrical stimulation to where you just stereoten like one neuron at a time because that seems like that want to be a feature and it just patient with if it's actually not.
  2262    172: It'll it'll be like, you know the point of of stimulating individual neurons would be to stimulate neural circuits I think and also to so you know, so you get neural circuits go on but then also you can manipulate the oscillatory cycles and in local and macro and waves in terms of like local micro circuits, but also you can you can manipulate the brains oscillatory activity on a larger scale.

  2274     767: It's a very high order. You know, Condition so when people are like when people have that aha moment you know when you have that insight when you're doing something creative that's associated with gamma gamma oscillations and there's a whole suite of you know, higher order mental functions that are associated with the gamma band and you find that people with Alzheimer's have a very strong reduction in the gamma band.

I guess I can reset the room people you can talk about anything you want the the general topics that are neurophysics brainwaves brain oscillations, neural circuits, nerve gear artificial intelligence, and ask any question or talk about anything that's been interesting to you.

  2279    1240: Yeah, it is very convoluted way of saying that but yes well, I mean, I'm pleased I might so I have I'm extremely familiar with biological oscillation units and vibration and metering and monitoring systems and you know the star COV2 virus and covet and etc just I this is I mean, I'm excited this is the first I've ever heard of that level of accuracy and specificity being available as far as.

  2285     147: ⟪ 511 characters skipped ⟫t's what it's going to be the trick was to try to figure out the mechanism because like I said, everything is is going to be sort of subject dependent, you know, because you could have the exact same oscillatory output from some network despite the fact that you have completely different transmitter profiles than I do before, you know, from most amounts of inbred strength.

  2327:   193: Yeah and the brain it has numerous different frequencies happening all of the time and a lot of times it has multiple frequencies that are superimposed upon each other for example if brainwaves that my lab has discovered is a very high frequency oscillation that only happens at the peaks of data waves so as this 130-ish hurts frequency that happens on top of these about eight to fourteen hurts frequencies, so there's the question of okay.
  2328    196: If we filter in different bands of frequencies, then what do we get and can we use those to control some sorts of devices this is Sharena and I am done speaking. Okay so that makes sense but then I guess I don't know I'm not sure how I'm not sure that I understand how brainwaves are generated so how how exactly is it that you generate brain waves from single neurons firing so is it like the the rate of which numerous fire kind of make oscillations in the electromagnetic field and that's where you're picking up is that where it is.

  2331:   187: The radio we're talking like 50 million to 1 billion oscillations per second it's not not close to the same frequency of what our what our brain is is detecting and and and and also like if you don't have a decoder then then that information means nothing it's like the it's like the the it's like the bumps on a CD CD on a record or the or the dots on a CD ROM, if you put your if you look at the dots on the CD ROM, it doesn't look like music to you if you pay your hand on our record, you don't hear.

  2334: ⟪ 306 characters skipped ⟫ and then there were these kind of oscillations that would difficult to pin down in terms of their relation to behaviors and so there's, Good evidence to show that that both actually pair and the the frequency of oscillation relates to the distance of functional connectivity, so the message passing is modulated from a particular area according to its frequency so as an example like gamma ban frequency firing in the ventral striatum are basically the speaks a distant connectivity to other parts of the brain.
  2335      63: If you look at I think a gamut that you just type into Google's scholar like gamma band oscillations and yeah just the word long distance. I think you'll see an example of this so so those things might not be mutual exclusive and they might speak functional connectivity across anatomical regions to create the emotional state and in train behavior.

  2407    19: The experience of life as a four dimensional computational live real time rendering. The brain's harmonic oscillators learn the firing patterns as phase changes cause resonating differential patterns.
  2408:   24: Double slit experiment, maybe by modeling phase patterns we are changing phases in reality outside our brain similar to oscillators work, but confused perhaps because time at quantum scale is happening on a different frequency compared to time at human scale. However what is implied in both quantum entanglement and in the double slit experiment is an oscillation in at least two places, one where the particle was measured and two where and when it was observed. So are our eyes transmitting a frequency event to the environment in 4D that is traced back in time to the measured particle, simply because the particle was some phase pattern that was defining space itself, and that implies that we are looking into a kind of liquid space at the quantum range, its liquid to us because its moving faster in time compared to us. So that from our perspective time is moving faster.
  2409    29: Oscillators attract frequencies, the oscillating power bands in the brain, Alpha, Theta, Delta, Gamma, and Beta each maintain an oscillation pattern that creates an electromagnetic attraction force. When I am observing something, it is like an oscillator powerband is interacting with a particle field, changing the entire shape of space itself, as the movement of that one particle affects the oscillation of the rest of the field of space. The human being as a body of oscillators is also one big electromagnetic oscillator that is literally defining space itself with each interaction.

  2415    50: Because the brain primarily communicates with itself via phase changes, tempo-spatially distributed phase changes, producing a phase space with its tonic oscillators, that are tracking phase changes (predictive coding, neurons predicting when they are going to fire), and thus observing phase changes

The high level patterns can be taken from any of the low level patterns, but in essence data in your brain is vectorized, virtual, invariant to space, time, and scale.
  2417    68: But in general a slower oscillation over time ought to result in a larger group of neurons being pulled into the same oscillator. So maybe what it means is that the triggering of the group of neurons is more even, because each terminal is getting more transmitters?

  2427      8:   10: So if energy is mass moving faster, then perhaps mass can be considered slow moving denser spacetime, the slower amplitude makes it easier for groups of oscillators to synchronize and so there are more particle collisions which I think result in the curvature of space by warming the em place field, making broad vertical lanes, longer slower stretched out horitonal particle lanes (that create time scale dependent time dilation)
  2428:    11:   149: All forces can be thought of a oscillatory differentials of varying configurations (differences in magnitude (amplitude and or duration)/ frequency)
  2429     20:   62: a slower negative oscillation has high volume which is high amplitude

  2432     37:   202: spacetime is going to oscillate back and forth between maximum energy like heat death and maximum amplitude like the big crunch, but the maximum of each is limited to half or 50 percent of what space is doing, so like a Yin Yang symbol they are forever changing in scale as they exchange locations in space with one another.
  2433:    38:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  2434:    52:    95: In the real brain, spikes have variable amplitude and frequency, they are soliton waves, they do not collide with other waves and they do not summarize. In the real brain spiking is not an all or nothing event as it is described in comp neuro, and neurons oscillate.
  2435:    53:   111: ⟪ 512 characters skipped ⟫ oscillator-type models (such as Kuramoto, for ex.). You can consider the spike as a delta pulse (for mathematical tractability), but you can also consider it an alpha function with variable latency, amplitude, frequency, rise and decay times. You can consider neurons as dimensionless points, but you can also model the full dendritic tree with ionic current dynamics differentially modulated on each compartment.. You can consider synaptic interactions as current transients, conductance transients, transmitter release probabilities... Etc, etc, etc..
  2436:    61:   15: So at the level of groups of oscillating neurons in brainwaves in the power band spectra such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma & high gamma we have a situation where there is an inverse relationship between amplitude and frequency. When frequency increases amplitude decreases, when amplitude increases frequency decreases, but how does this happen when at the individual neuron level the Amplitude is supposed to not be changing?
  2437:    74:   23: the amplitude of particle scattering is high in spaced out space, but its low in high frequency oscillating space (stars, planets, atoms)

So the 7 version of you is the orthogonal or non-linear patterns emerging from oscillations between oscillators of different scales which exert forces on each other that blend across frequency/amplitude scales. It's transmission & memory would consist of novel pattern configurations that are driven by the interplay between the other primary sensor freq / amp scales. 
  2440     96:   19: larger scale memories would exist in physical configuration changes to oscillators as configured by LTD or large scale inhibition patterns to neural circuits in promixity to a neuron's phasic spiking event. The process of large scale LTD patterns establishes the cadence of brainwaves oscillation patterns reactive, bundles of neurons firing at low rates with high amplitude that are resistant to but responding to phasic firing bursts over spacetime.

  2442    124:   3: It can be challenging to imagine your soul as a computational space. However imagine you are like a circle in a fourier transform, like you are a combination of frequences and amplitudes from oscillating positions. Imagine you are like a cycle of neural coincidence patterns connected by a process similar to what AI people call "deep learning". So your neural circuits connect together tempo-spatial patterns and make predictions about future inputs. These connected predictions are the roots of thinking, and decision making is a motor response to these future predictions, that predict the causes (of movements) in the world. So in summary your brain is connecting sense stimulated spatial positions, frequencies, and amplitudes to predict the future and coordinate a movement. A computer can definitely simulate this process and so a computer can simulate a conscious experience.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

So, a certain well, rates rates is, is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.
  2449    258:   45: It's very robust and so I was talking about how in 2012 there. Actually 50 years of brainwave entrainment research. There's just a new article that came out was talking to recidente about this neuroscience news.com article boosting memory performance by finding the amplitude of brain waves in speeding oscillations. So there are 50 years of this, 50 years of research with with Rain Raven treatment, there's policy because hemocinked, there's the casino mine machine.
  2450:   280:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  2451    292:   480: That is going to provide a strong & wide amplitude pattern perhaps that will oscillate for a long time. That might lower the noise on the brains visual patterns, and the brains audio patterns, and all the worrying thoughts
  2452:   301:   323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
  2453    308:   24: You have like a if you have like a mega star megaphone, right? That's it's the principle of a megaphone. It's got a shape that amplifies, is it sound? It sound oscillates along the rings. It's, it's shape becomes magnified as long as there's and if you so you're increase the amplitude of the sound, it goes more widely.
  2454    312:   27: That's a like it's like a dimensional characteristic, right? But that's the amplitude is important for, for setting, for setting oscillations, right? For neurons that are that sort of set the timing, it creates neurons that, that, that can oscillate together, that's part of the mechanism part. One of the attractors of the mechanism of a group of groove, oscillations.
  2455:   315:    17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
  2456:   316:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.
  2457:   326:   23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
  2458:   332:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  2459:   335:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  2460    336:   19: That's how the group oscillation happens. And that is the zero point field, that's slow. Oh, high amplitude, and oscillation is zero. Point field and then what's estioned to that are like one neuron fight one and you're on like really fires out of sync, it doesn't just fire out a sink, it fires at a basic rate, that's when it shoots up fires.
  2461:   349:   27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.
  2462:   356:   125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  2463:   361:   231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.
  2464:   423:   47:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)
  2465  

  2475     245:   20: That creates a phase rendering in the oscillation group of neurons (that is acting like a single sensor/transmitter like a group of firelies referencing the book Sync).
  2476:    254:   6: I think this note was intended to expand on the reference frames idea shared in the book A Thousand Brains by Jeff Hawkins, and expand that to say that the tonic brainwave powerband oscillation, in the Theta frequency for one example, serves as the Reference frame in the MACRO sense, and that changes in neural firing, from both fired neurons, and from inhibited neurons, that is the new input that is compared to the old input, that is when the brain's old data is updated with new data, that is when your perception of reality incorporates some new information, that is when your existing oscillating perception of the room notices a new person walking in the door.
  2477     264:    67: A concept expanded upon in the book "On Intelligence via Jeff Hawkings" about the self similarity of the neo cortex, and later the concept was expanded to the hippocampus, and essentially predictive coding was extended to all cells with Cellular Oscillator Tomography introduced by the Self Aware Networks Institute.

  2481     292:   75: The only thing it doesn't propose is the conjecture of this book that brainwave oscillations are information carriers, in the tiny changes in hz, variations in Theta, Alpha frequencies for example. I'm arguing that those tiny variations are not noise, but instead they represent attractors for encoded expectation patterns that serve as a baseline of consciousness, or a ground of being, a tonic wave pattern, that incoming action potentials with phasic & high phasic bursts disrupt, change, and cause inhibitory waves, that ripple from tiny neurons to the whole brain.
  2482:    352:   23: In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and absolute time is equivalent to non-existence, or it is the infrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens. Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends. 
  2483     362:   2: (oscillat) imagining the reactions to my book

  2487     595:   32: Ultimately the best way to think about how features detected by the neural networks of our brain are bound together comes from thinking about Neurons Syncing like Fireflies as discussed in the book Sync by Steven Strogatz and from thinking about big groups of oscillators interacting with other oscillators as discussed in the book Rhythms of the Brain by György Buzsáki combined the two books provide both a low level and a high level conceptual background for how information might be bound together in oscillations, with information clustering because of how the physics of oscillators work at all scales. At the level of regular cells coincident firing in receptors can trigger the cell to unlock some specific learned (or evolved) reaction (that might be encoded in dna, or it might result from the current state of the  cells information configuration represented by its protein structure at that moment in time) at the neuron level that coincident firing is not just at the receptor level, but also at the dendritic level, and with pyramidal neurons also the soma might have its own sensory thresholds that are different from the dendrite, which make pyramidal neurons the most sensitive sensors in a sense, with the most flexbility for sensory representation, and signal transmission.

Quadrupole times Oscillators considering the sum of dendrite to multi vesicle release (M) times the (i/N) iteration of the number of neurons firing in a sequences, times Amplitude over frequency (1/f), by multiplication I mean time sequences, many Cortical Column oscillation patterns are multiplied under the Quadruple for example.

  2493     852:   109: They they do it. They're able to combine so when you're on a sensory capability but because of the mathematical mathematical principles of oscillation, you should read about and book sink by my mathematician. Stephen Strogets the because of the principles of oscillation neurons can by synchronizing together, they can combine their just like fireflies.
  2494:    938:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.
  2495     942:   193: So, if you want to read more about fireflies and sinking, I read the booksink and that taught me so much about you know what it means when and that neurons are oscillators. And that, then the whole brain is oscillating. It's a chaotic, chaotic oscillation like that. Like the book sync, really helps me understand that the computations of, of oscillations and that informed, the self-orients book.

  2500     983:    65: Of that one oscillator. Like that's that's when we're going from like you know to the pyramid cell that now collects the internal and that connects to another portable column. All right? So, the idea is that the the output of one oscillator. So, the oscillator magnifies the the pattern that and if you look at this book called sink and chapter 2, it's really great.

  2502    1002:   186: So so in the book saying, how order emerges from chaos, what he says is if you if you have the aces that basically a different. So a bad point is a point that if you start from a bad point the whole system doesn't reach oscillation. Right. But he's saying that that points have no area because if you have a bad point, what happens is in one cycle that bad point moves to a most from one oscillator to another.
  2503    1005:   29: You're gonna need sufficient power for that to move your arms and legs, right? So so the, so the neurons, when they oscillate together they're they are sending a charge together and so the brain can have groups of neurons become oscillators that that in the oscillators, as I'll point on the book can learn patterns and the patterns that they learn.

  2533    106:   8: the non-magnetic part of the EM spectrum is gravitational spectrum, it's about the oscillating curvature of space, the morphology of the vector field that has been embedded into the shape of space as part of the expanding wave of a dense oscillating particle, such as an atom or such as a star, each of which cast a wave into space corresponding to their scale (volume), density, heat, and its kinetic & angular momentum

  2538    171:    9: Because because the fingers, the fingers are ultimately made out of atoms and atoms are mostly empty space. The one, the one thing that that an atom does that helps provide structure is it's sort of creates its own density, and it's moving very fast. It's oscillating. Very fast is in a sense.
  2539:   172:   11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.

  2562     72:   6: You are a fractal oscillating node on an oscillating branch of the cosmos which is an fractal oscillating that is actually a single oscillation from the perspective outside time and space.
  2563:    75:   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.
  2564     76:   8: I would divide the entire brain into a series of fractal sensor arrays, with sensor arrays joining up with other sensory arrays to magnify their receptive fields by each adjacent oscillator they are tonically firing with.

  2568    115:   25: I like to think of space as something that was created everywhere at once, and at every time at once, as if all of time is forever happening inside an ever present now moment. We are experiencing the frequences of time folding around itself in massive oscillators, and micro oscillators. We are oscillators inside oscillators with oscillators inside us with a fractal ordinance.

Tse dismisses the notion that consciousness could be quantum, because the brain is too warm for quantum coherence, (the temperature would scramble the "you" frequency). He also thinks that indeterministic quantum fluctuations could interfere with the timing of a neural oscillation just enough to make a human unpredictable to any machine that was not able to simulate or predict all the quantum noise in a person's brain. That's the boring part.
  2621:    209:   14: The chemical properties of dopamine, serotonin, acetyl-choline, and gaba must have temporal effects determining the likely oscillation value for the group oscilation array, which is why gaba neurons tend to oscillate with delta frequences. This makes sense because the combined oscillator force of a lipid sack of neurotransmitters is going to cause a variation of some sort in the frequency experience that is transmitted between neurons. Such that the gravitational or combined oscillatory momentum effect of neurotransmitters which determine the density of the vesicle sack, how much energy is required to displace it, and the rate of the dissipation of energy as neurotransmitters collide with the post synaptic neuron, and the characteristics of the impact such as was it like sending a bag of rocks or like sending a bag of feathers, tactile sensations and tongue sensations I would expect to have lower frequency higher amplitude waves (in the somatosensory cortex) because we might want to use the broad surface area of network arrays to track low frequency pertubations, like textures on a surface, which is about spatial representation, so the humunchulus I would expect to have a slow frequency high amplitude tonic oscillation like delta or theta, and the amplitudinal reach across the post synaptic surface area which increases or decreases the amplitude of the multimedium phase soliton wave signal that is passed to another neuron

  2625:    217:   6: In essence though the human being is a fractal of oscillators, a fractal of a dissipative system, and oscillators essentially dissipate incoming signals, balancing them, high frequency resonating signals in particular exert significant electric waves, magnetic waves, mechanical wave, and chemical wave forces, inhibiting some of their tonic counterparts in their respective sensor arrays, while exciting neighboring sensor arrays.

  2627:    222:   64: microtubules that receive quantum scale coherence/decoherence patterns would store them, and change their configuration/function and signal transmission primarily by increasing the frequency of the quantum field at some xyz coordinate in phase space. this would result in quantum entanglement or phase binding between oscillating neurons at the microtubule scale.
  2628:    226:   78: "Frequency Is Critical for Spatial Synchronization and Phase Relations in Oscillator Networks
  2629:    227:   79: "if a pair of oscillators do not interact and they have a frequency difference, their phase-relation will change continuously with a rate determined by their frequency difference (detuning), a phenomenon termed phase precession.
  2630:    228:   80: "Nevertheless, this review demonstrates that changes of a few Hz either between brain locations or a moment-to-moment basis, according to stimulus or cognitive conditions, is a property of neuronal oscillations in many frequency bands. Moreover, the precise oscillation frequency can have profound consequences in terms of synchronization properties (correlation, phase relations). Hence, we argue that manipulations of detuning represent a key experimental target to causally infer oscillatory properties without strongly affecting other network properties. Advanced multi-neuron electrophysiological and optical techniques (optogenetics, cellular voltage imaging) in future studies will provide exciting possibilities to measure and target frequency generation in neural oscillations and synchronization during cognition and behavior."

In otherwords if spacetime had a default wave pattern, a particle exists as a difference from the spacetime wave pattern in terms of a change in its frequency / magnitude ratio or from another perspective a change in its velocity / mass ratio

  2637:    278:   23: In a sense in this model spacetime as we know it is plausibly an eternally looping structure, and absolute time is equivalent to non-existence, or it is the infrequent frequency range (non-existence has no frequency interval, so it never happens. Ever present time (eternal absolute unchanging) is a bad point in the context of bad points as mentioned in the book Sync by Author Steven Strogatz) Since it can't be affected by the harmonic oscillator that is spacetime we can infer that spacetime never begins & never ends. 
  2638:    293:   27: Simply put the rate or frequency/magnitude of oscillations is stimulating growth and the direction of growth towards oscillations that have a matching frequency/magnitude, because at that interval of time, it required less energy for particles to move in that direction OR spacetime itself was moving faster in that direction (because space was heated up between the pair of frequency/magnitude matching oscillations) (insert here something like the free energy principle or law of energy conservation or Feynman's Path Integral, or extropy, or all 4) and what you get explains the clustering of oscillations, LTP long term memory, memory formation, association, the direction of synaptic growth, and the opposite of sync (the splay state) has the reverse effect, like the 'virtual entity' mentioned elsewhere in my notes.
  2639:    312:   21: If we artificially connected 2 minds together what would keep our minds from merging together? An oscillating bridge that never completely syncs with our brains oscillation. Hmm I wonder if each sensory input region has its own distinct oscillations that are mostly separate from the others spatially, or connected spatially but separate in powerband frequency patterns or both spatial & frequency segregation of sensory input regions except when synchronization is required for conscious perception or attention, such as when the tempo-parietal junction lights up.

Brainwaves, such as the theta brainwave, can perhaps be thought of as wireless high amplitude low frequency phase shifts applied to large numbers of neurons in an oscillating cell assembly (or cortical column) at some sequence of time intervals, and they sort of revolve around the timing of the decay of the action potential, so each interaction of inhibitory brainwave bursts following each action potential in a sequence of action potential bursts is intersecting with the previous & the next brainwave, and this process I am suggesting is like Taylor Series Polynomials, in that their effect on one another is one that improves the resolution & accuracy of whatever is being modeled at that moment by that oscillating cell assembly.

What I can add to that is that you also have temporal scales happening in the brain with fast input activity from the senses, and slowed frequency towards the top of the brain's cortical columns, if we could use the analogy of the gears of an ancient clock computer like the Antikythera Mechanism to picture different gears of different sizes to imagine how oscillations from the synapse, to the action potential to the neural circuit to the cortical column, to brainwaves, existing as like gears on a clock, oscillations of different scales interacting like gears of different scales, affecting each other at different rates, which results in behavior patterns that emerge at different time scales with the larger gears near the top of the scale heirarchy representing behavior patterns that develop over decades. Then we can imagine what Dr. Karl Friston is talking about, behavior patterns that are time-scale dependent, and somewhat independent from short time scale behaviors. I think Friston's argument could also be paraphrased to include the idea that our culture or our shared stories with other people also represent another ti

  2659:    508:   71: But brainwave entrainment with audio can also help normalize brainwave activity, so the whole brain is oscillating at the same frequency pattern.
  2660:    509:   97: Although I think I just came up with a hypothesis, which is that the action potential spikes are at much higher frequencies, so gamma frequences should appear first, then beta frequencys, then alpha, then theta, then delta, in that order, from sensor input, to the peak of the brain's cycling heirarchy. That energy drop in time represents a sort of signal decay in one sense, but it represents the oscillatory dynamics of a system that has changes coming into it (from the sensory input areas). The oscillatings of individual cells will knock on and ripple some perceptable effect (a phase shift in the tonic oscillation pattern).

  2670:    600:   63: They're all also lined up to reflect one another's perturbations, via the tonic or regular low frequency high magnitude oscillation, and one of them is going to create a rippling effect across the whole of them. So they're gonna have a signal that ripples across all of them that causes all of them to basically change their oscillatory (rate) signature by the dissipated amount. 
  2671:    603:   198: So humans scale, consciousness is definitely like a very specific pattern of of power band frequencies that are oscillating. It's certain rates and a certain fruit. So, a certain well, rates rates is, is referring to frequency, right? But it's there's a certain frequency range and there's a certain amplitude range that helps create the rendering of the mind that can be perceived by the, the oscillating entity that is the brain and the person and the other people.

Also it would be interesting to know if there is a measurable frequency to the exRNA message that corresponds to a similar frequency in the receiving exosome, that might provide a more specific oscillatory tractor beam that pulls specific exRNA sequences to itself.

But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.

But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.

  2677:    666:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  2678:    673:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.

So what I'm saying is that LTD and LTP are both accomplished with also Tory signals, and also it's for a signal, the oscillatory. Coupling and decoupling is basically like accomplished either through the mutual stimulation, or Hey, and also Tori is placed a which accomplishes like a stimulation frequency pattern and which is weird.

  2681:    692:   271: Of the oscillations of these matrices of patterns. This is temple space for frequency. So you could have the I should say, more than that, it's the temple spatial frequency of the of this circuit that interlaces different sets of of patterns together.
  2682:    707:    31: I guess it's like now we went up like one point to voltage or something and so is tiny modification to the to the oscillation phase frequency and then that so that oscillations collector phase frequency is you know that is like that's a that's a brainwave right? The face frequency emerging from net from cortical columns and oscillators groups of neurons.
  2683:    709:    95: Yeah. So that would be like a longer frequency or larger frequency. I'm not sure how to how higher for, it's a higher frequenc. I think. Yeah, higher frequency. Yeah, so we're talking like hurts. So if if we're sending out so their height, so the gamma camera bursts, you know the frequencies of gamma ray of gamma vert of sorry, the gamma frequency of brainwaves because the brain can oscillate between like, 0.02 Hertz and 600 Hertz, and the high gamma burst to faceobok burst, those are high frequency births so tent.
  2684:    710:    97: Tonic oscillations are low frequency verse. And I'd in the idea is that to understand the oscillation the oscillations tend to, like get divided into power bands. That are they maintain a distance between themselves of like 2.17? And, and it can differ a little bit between different animal species. How exactly what?
  2685:    712:   105: And because well, when you get into, because the, when you get to the thought bridges, you know, the the thalamus is like this, this Delta firing circuit, right? And it is got it's it's sort of like you want to be in the same frequency range for data data data comparability, I think like, and I think you need, I think if if we one offslider is going to be able to receive and interpret the signals of another oscillator, I think you want some sort of like frequency matching in terms of the rate of information for it just for so that there's an apples.
  2686:    715:   293: Say LTD is long-term, potentiation, and LCD is long-term, depression. It's creating a low frequency depression, but the whole oscillator is tracking that in terms of the depression depression. So, the global oscillation would still like increase.
  2687:    718:   323: Oscillations because oh, because low frequency is like, it affects the wider area. What low frequency knows? If that are gonna affect a water area because they have a higher amplitude, you're gonna in and allow neurons to basically are going to be more likely to join up in to a single oscillator with low frequencies, and, but going from Basically, but yeah.
  2688:    719:   325: So the inhibition process and so, so going back to with the inhibition process. That comes as a result of the the action potential is going to magnify sort of like matte. It's going to innocence magnify the impact of the action potential on the oscillator, but it's an in between step between the action potential, which is it, which is a high phase, high frequency activity to the oscillation, which is a low oscillations, can be low frequency activity and the in between step, is that a set of neurons are inhibited the set of neurons that were a set of neurons that were connected that were connected to the firing order on that were inhibited to this.
  2689:    729:   34: It's also and pushing out into, it's it might, it's like, I just imagine that this the same process is creating vertical lanes, through through the combined oscillations of, you know, of groups of atoms. You can just imagine like a good like a whole world of molecules that are all oscillating at the same frequency that they're combined to fat is going to create like a thick lane of and I say they claim because like okay so like an atom is like a it's like a piece of space that has has been crunched together pulled together.
  2690:    741:   24: Right? Because because you are like electromagnetically as an oscillator. You're sending out more of more of a spike more about like a more of like a high gamma frequency, right? It's there's more novel information happening. It's a 
  2691:    745:    17: And then we'll have to consider, I mean. So actually what's interesting is like The difference between electricity and magnetism like electricity. I think it's I think it's like, okay, so maybe it's an analogy of the spike and the, which is high frequency, low amplitude, and maybe electromagnetism is like an analogy of the oscillation of the tonic firing pattern versus like higher amplitude (spatially, in terms of aggregate effect, so large groups of neurons oscillate tonically, absorbing small action potential spikes that have low spatial amplitude but higher relative frequency. The neuron that spikes becomes an attractor of energy that dissipates across the tonic oscillation over time. like signals dissipating between two clocks (reference the book Sync by Steven Strogatz.)
  2692:    749:   122: And so an oscillation can maintain a shape until it dissipates even if it even if its frequency increases and its amplitude decreases or its amplitude increases and its frequency decreases and I kind of think of like yes. So, if we could think of particles as being space itself, like space being like the large scale version of articles, but it exists as both particles and spacing because frequencies between intervals, between the intervals of oscillators either continuing continuing or resonating away dissipating.
  2693:    752:    11: At the same time that inhibition cycle. Is creating the oscillation frequency and
  2694:    753:    13: But, and oscillation frequency allows the, the oscillation frequency is seen when you have, let's say that the gamma frequency is defined by the decay rate of the, of the inhibition of signal or the LTD signal and so you have. But you have with the camera, you have this sort of like linking or association or binding of different gamma patterns or cross multiple reasons of the brain that happened had some sort of coincidental pattern in temp and time or space or stale, or break or frequency.
  2695:    754:   129: And you can make an argument that the physicists, the high frequency physicverse are decaying oscillators. They're not meant to repeat indefinitely. They're meant to decay and, and the decay is in part part of how the the rest of the oscillator gets to learn a pattern but also be prepared for new patterns.
  2696:    760:   9: Perfect frequency oscillators for a critical for criticality state, achieving a criticality state. That's not like,
  2697:    767:   23: It's got this sort of like for me. Like something that's like a deeper emotion. Has a broader lower frequency higher amplitude feeling to it. Maybe it's coming over later, making it a large, oscillator making it because not only can small oscillators make shifts but large oscillators can. So by other large oscillators, So that's interesting.
  2698:    773:    82: If you have a greater number of the constituent parts of brain activity synchronizing in some powerband frequency like Theta, the low frequency pattern will naturally have a high magnitude area effect to coordinate many more cells into tonic oscillating network activity in the Theta range.
  2699:    774:    84: If you have incoming Sensory Signals that were much more sparse, in terms of their area effect, like single spikes instead of big oscillating groups, and these single spikes were distinguished with a much higher frequency (relative to the tonic pace of the oscillating group) then you are beginning to describe the situation in the brain where the oscillating group of cells can detect the novel firing patterns that represent memories, because those neurons that fired reset the pace of the group of neurons that were inhibited by the firing of that one neuron.
  2700:    778:   12: And but like what I'm saying is like if power brands like are easily converge and oscillatory, dynamics and electrons are attracted to power bands, then the power bands might be serving as a, the power bands of low frequency. Oscillators like between 0 point to hurts and having 70 parts.
  2701:    780:   22: So, there's just like, who's acting state are ready, state, which is like low time firing and then incoming, seriously are like fast drilled system and I'm saying that the stuff that finds our consciousness is the diversions between the high frequency, you know, activity, narrow pattern and the low frequency, oscillating of pattern of observing neurons.
  2702:    781:   44: But oscillator itself is going to insert a sort of attraction to pulling that smaller. Oscillating, neuron back into the same tonic frequency flow, I just ready for being ready for a phase of firing. So the phase of firing to be cold for, but it happens because of physics the physics and oscillators and oscillation is sort of like
  2703:    784:   33: ⟪ 409 characters skipped ⟫ a ton of firing phase, which is like the standard expectation and like of being, like, in the, that's when neurons are fine together in large groups in oscillators, and it's like a slower, you know, frequency fine pattern during the day, you might have like the power band of your alpha, oscillating layers might be greatest during the day.
  2704:    802:   16: So it's able to send but it doesn't send us alternate, but I think perhaps it doesn't send us all it's underway to other neurons. This end of the nerve, transmitters instead. And then there are transmitters are transmitted in timing. All right, so that's carrying the type of frequency of how of our frequency is carving dot matrix and the oscillator, right?
  2705:    817:   11: A kind of it isn't. It's like intrinsic oscillation and one sense like a, like the frequency of the universe. Like it's an electromagnet. It's an atom is like an oscillation inside, an electromagnetic field. And that oscillation is creating the density. And the density is the space time which is not separate from the content of space-time is just creating is pretty the density that allows one cloud of atoms to repel and push on another cloud of atoms without actually touching because they're densifying the space around them.
  2706:    818:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  2707:    828:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  2708:    835:   330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
  2709:    842:   473: It's assault and waves. You can have a lot of different basic patterns happening. There are such they're so high frequency that they're sort of like impacting the slower frequency. Tonic wave oscillations and a big way like like the I think the faster faster frequencies are cause all of the slower frequencies pay attention because then because there is this sort of like, you know, there's this so we oscillators work.
  2710:    847:   29: Now you say well now wait a second. If if whatever you feed individual neurons gets wiped out. Because here's his thing is, we're thinking there's this thing. There's this idea that wait a second, the oscillation itself. How could it represent? Complex information. It's all the same that you have, like, that's like you all these neurons are that are, how could the frequency, say, the group of neurons?
  2711:    848:   41: Out of its normal oscillatory, frequency the rest of the oscillation resets it. So there's this whole like that just hold like neurophysics thing where we have to talk about the physics of brain, waves and tendrides and There are transmitters and I think that there's a lot of stuff to mention, but we can kind of get a framework out of it.
  2712:    863:   13: So then you you don't get that first thing effect that you would normally get, what do they mean by a couple? Are they do? They mean that they're oscillating together at the same frequency or is that means the synapses that the activity in the dendrite is enough to cause the solema to burst on and it can go the other way.
  2713:    867:   15: So going back to oscillations each type of oscillation. I mean, each type of activity, is going to have its own feeling to human brain. The human brain has to make mistake. So with color, like there's a frequency range associated with each color. And so the argument is that the human brain has to make green green when it renders it and brown brown in contrast to green and the space in between his blue space or black space in between the ground.
  2714:    871:   29: And so, what I'm saying, what I'm talking about right now is the is the EEG think the EG frequency range synchronization between two speakers when two human beings get together and talk? There is a sort of synchronization in their tonic oscillation, which is in the EEG. Frequency spectrum. So you can see that they are synchronizing while they are communicating.
  2715:    875:   87: I say just to complete that topic. So these higher frequency oscillations, call them demo or let's say everything over 40, hrs. Do you do sort of see how well for them? Get anything, but some people say it's helping the binding problem. It's is part of amplifying signals between cortical areas other things.
  2716:    878:   31: So, what happens is that you use two different oscillating. Energies. When you have an author, they have to combine In the act of them, combining is causing the hold network, as a whole, to recognize an individual event. Because the act of, of changing your electrodynamics to match the new, my new change in the oscillation frequency, because it is a new change.
  2717:    879:   43: There's a feeling, there's a feeling that is is actually. So you have this regular oscillator, that is exerting an electromagnetic regulatory pattern, that's observable. And if that oscillators frequency changes, that's going to be observable and neural network is going to be able to observe the change in the frequencies of oscillators and if that neural network was conscious, you would call it feelings.
  2718:    882:   27: The music is not just hurts, right? It's amplitude. Hurts the amplitude, frequency and amplitude zoom. So the brain is locked in the brain is locked in which are oscillations. It's locked in chain reactions. Locked in oscillation chain reactions or train reactions of oscillations. The thing is like, you have you have smaller chain reactions, which is aware, you have a neuron fires and then another neuron fires and then the fires.
  2719:    884:   41: Now, the thing is, these neurons receive the each independently receiving signal, so that, so when I say they oscillate together, they oscillate together with what's called a tonic frequency, which is like, okay. Well, just for regularity, I'm always gonna be ready to fire. So I'm gonna be oscillating at a regular sort of frequency, just so I'm always ready.
  2720:    885:   43: This is my ready for. Is my ready, frequency? I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. I'm ready, I'm ready. And it's a group oscillation. It's a big group of neurons that are oscillating. Okay, and then what's gonna happen then is this this bigger oscillation is going to create. It's going to influence the, the electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field of the entire brain, because it's bigger, because it's bigger than one neuron.
  2721:    891:   81: So that could mean that you have an oscillation that where, okay? So let's say that you have like an offer frequency oscillation that has a certain pattern that is that has special and turnable characteristics that are you unique identifiers for a specific pattern. They represent maybe they represent a flower, okay?
  2722:    896:    65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
  2723:    898:   113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?
  2724:    899:   119: Right, you know all of this I guess but the supertiasmatic nucleus is super casematic nucleus it is about twenty million oscillating neurons, they're all oscillating at the same frequency. And most neurons are offsetting the same frequency, but there in but they're oscillating with a sort of temple which is called it's a.
  2725:    900:   125: That was maybe me getting tired. No, no. I was rocking because I was that was me symbolizing that there's an offshore pattern. So that my head I had movement was like oscillation. Levels. Yeah, make it better remember. Yeah, so. Because the tonic frequency pattern it's a low frequency pattern and it has a high has a high amplitude and there's a lot of so that here's the interesting thing at a thing that I uncovered, okay?
  2726:    905:   231: They have for your dendrites to fire that's that then because they're longer then then that should be affecting the. The I mean that means that it's gonna affect the frequency and the frequency is gonna affect the amplitude and so that should so then you're oscillations and in the in human beings should have more because we have longer dendrites and that means it takes longer for potentially it takes longer for.
  2727:    918:   105: Is what being transmitted is it only a matter of the frequency of the oscillation and the size of it because then you're back to two different patterns one is like how much like and that could be like that could be like a rich there could be interpreted as like force right it could be interpreted this force because there's more force that's being forcing as forcing the time window opens.
  2728:    969:   71: I think that would it wouldn't necessarily cause your brain to go out of control but but it might change the the oscillation frequency of your. Of your. Of your brain rhythms which which would be interesting but I but I just wanted to sort of dial down on that and in just ask you if you really know if it's not possible to like for neural length specifically to reduce the amount of electrical stimulation to where you just stereoten like one neuron at a time because that seems like that want to be a feature and it just patient with if it's actually not.

  2732:   1042:   193: Yeah and the brain it has numerous different frequencies happening all of the time and a lot of times it has multiple frequencies that are superimposed upon each other for example if brainwaves that my lab has discovered is a very high frequency oscillation that only happens at the peaks of data waves so as this 130-ish hurts frequency that happens on top of these about eight to fourteen hurts frequencies, so there's the question of okay.
  2733:   1048:   187: The radio we're talking like 50 million to 1 billion oscillations per second it's not not close to the same frequency of what our what our brain is is detecting and and and and also like if you don't have a decoder then then that information means nothing it's like the it's like the the it's like the bumps on a CD CD on a record or the or the dots on a CD ROM, if you put your if you look at the dots on the CD ROM, it doesn't look like music to you if you pay your hand on our record, you don't hear.
  2734:   1058:     57: ⟪ 298 characters skipped ⟫ and then there were these kind of oscillations that would difficult to pin down in terms of their relation to behaviors and so there's, Good evidence to show that that both actually pair and the the frequency of oscillation relates to the distance of functional connectivity, so the message passing is modulated from a particular area according to its frequency so as an example like gamma ban frequency firing in the ventral striatum are basically the speaks a distant connectivity to other parts of the brain.
  2735:   1082:   24: Double slit experiment, maybe by modeling phase patterns we are changing phases in reality outside our brain similar to oscillators work, but confused perhaps because time at quantum scale is happening on a different frequency compared to time at human scale. However what is implied in both quantum entanglement and in the double slit experiment is an oscillation in at least two places, one where the particle was measured and two where and when it was observed. So are our eyes transmitting a frequency event to the environment in 4D that is traced back in time to the measured particle, simply because the particle was some phase pattern that was defining space itself, and that implies that we are looking into a kind of liquid space at the quantum range, its liquid to us because its moving faster in time compared to us. So that from our perspective time is moving faster.

The interaction points cause cascading wripples in space, affecting the fabric of space time, making gravity possible as an attractor state between oscillatorys which are warming spacetime to attract electric phases and bind them together, slowing them down into increasingly dense mass states.

  3294     12:   14: but space is not really expanding, its just expanding relative to the oscillators, one might also say that the oscillators are shrinking and space is staying the same. This would make sense because dissipative systems tend to dissolve eventually. This means that planets are shrinking and becoming more dense gaining mass as they move through space attracting new particles through collision lanes
  3295:    15:   46: The question is what started the first oscillation in the universe? but perhaps its about the conceptual probability of a universe existing being split between two undecidable states, 1 existing somewhere like mass, or 2 being a frequency like energy, that is defined as an interval between two points in spacetime that it takes for something with an oscillation or spin to travel. 
  3296     23:   118: I think Quantum Gravity is the result of space warping around oscillator flows, or large scale wave patterns in the electromagnetic field around masses caused by the interactions of oscillators of different scales with different properties.

  3307    105:   30: I suspect that the reason we do not see light decay is because it's moving in normal time which is frozen relative to how fast time moves for us, our experience of time has a lot of harmonic oscillation between entropic states, with the mass (information) of physical space moving slower than light but transforming (decaying/emerging) faster than light.

  3310    136:   19: the combined reflection of oscillating mass might multiple like a laser like the Bose-Einstein Condensate

  3313    191:   25: I like to think of space as something that was created everywhere at once, and at every time at once, as if all of time is forever happening inside an ever present now moment. We are experiencing the frequences of time folding around itself in massive oscillators, and micro oscillators. We are oscillators inside oscillators with oscillators inside us with a fractal ordinance.
  3314:   301:   86: in other words the vector field of space time and the mass of space time are examples of two different spatial/temporal patterns that are the inverse of multiplying micro-frequency patterns that are multiplying when they oscillate together harmonically.
  3315    349:   17: the arc of the oscillating of mass is shorter

  3321    421:   420: Having space time to it's putting a drag on space time. So it's causing space time to and be faster closer to the center of the oscillator and slow down further away from the center of the. Also the curvature space time starts from the center of any oscillator and the this the the mass of the oscillator, the combined oscillator.
  3322:   431:    99: So like, imagine that each oscillator is like a 3d configuration of space time. It's creating 3d space time. But, but, but well in actuality it's creating intervals of three days based on it. So, the interval of state of through these baseline increases with mass or decreases with frequency.
  3323    461:   32: So if it's oscillating to get, if everything is oscillating together then it should have a magnified pressure or density. But if things are, if if the oscillations are if it's not oscillating together as a mass then it might have is a single mass and it might have much less density.

  3404     83:    18: This means that neural oscillating array-projection tomography can physically represent patterns as (non-linear) phase variation sequences. Then oscillating cell assemblies will learn the expressed spatial & temporal phase patterns happening within their cell assembly & derive from those learned patterns the shapes of concepts, the shapes & parameters & properties feelings, objects, sensations, and anything else you can become conscious of. These are learned patterns that percolate through the oscillation cell assemblies with something like infinite summation but basically infinite summation as a neural network would accomplish it through coincident detection, and this tempo-spatial rendering of action potential sequences in phase patterns would be "seen" or perceived by the receptive fields of downstream (receiving) dendrites in the next neural array, cortical column, or oscillating cell assembly.

    29:   152: Most of the tonic brainwave activity is detectable with EEG sensors. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, (and also low Gamma 30-50hz). My argument is that the tonic frequency spectrum is slower frequency and higher magnitude so it has wider spatial effects which are useful for binding or synchronizing oscillations across vast distances in the brain. Phasic Brainwave frequences can spike much higher.
    30    153  

    47    24  
    48:   25: but changes in dendritic spines that reduce or increase active potassium receptors may have the biggest effect on short term memory as the neurons spike is going to close sooner or later, resulting in higher frequency, low amplitude, small novel sequence firing, faster phasic spikes (information broadcasting) or low frequency, high amplitude, group guassian firing, slower tonic spikes (information observation).
    49    26  

    56    10  
    57:   11: but many of the incoming sensory paths are in the alpha powerband frequency range, so maybe alpha, beta, and gamma frequences can be considered phasic
    58    12  

    62    16  
    63:   17: I'm not sure this is right or a useful way to look at things because in a sense the consistent repetition of any frequency range would be considered tonic, and changes or differences in the phase could be either inhibited or phasic or high phasic, and those difference levels signal a degree of difference that helps shape both unconscious mental patterns and conscious mental qualia
    64  

    76    16  
    77:   17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations

    89:   43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.

I think the information that makes up the human experience consists of synchronizing coincidence patterns in the higher phasic gamma frequencies and inhibiting decoherence patterns disrupting the lower frequency tonic firing of the aware mind. Yes this process involves electric-chemical interactions, but the quantum mechanic may be as mechanical in the brain as a drive shaft is in a car, no reason at this point to assume the drive shaft is conscious.

   412:   47: One way to consider Information theory is as a description of how information can be encoded in the variations between frequent signals and infrequent signals, the frequency of tonic for example ought to have low information value, but by contrast the low information value of tonic signals might amplify the meaning of less common phasic signals, but if information can be encoded as phase changes between common signals that have little meaning, and uncommon signals that have more meaning then you can encode information in anything, and effectively information is encoded in amino-acid sequences in RNA & DNA.
   413    48  Right so each receptor on a cell might be unique, which means a unique information containing structure, or a protein, acts as a 3D shape that performs a detection function, a sodium receptor detects for example sodium ions that are allowed to pass through the sodium receptor.

If the soliton wave hypothesis combined with Hodgkin & Huxley + Chemical Neurotransmitter are both true, then a single neuron would be able to observe, learn, and transmit 4D patterns to its network. If only the chemical neurotransmitter theory is true, then at least neurons can communicate both their amplitude & frequency via multi-vesicle-release, which by itself is going to transmit a temporal pattern that has spatial characteristic into the network. In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.

In both situations the neurons are using their dendrites to track 4D patterns (at least via the build up of ions in the branches & body that create the electromagnetic charge that distributes transmitters and opens up ion channels in the exit synapses) and their synapses to transmit patterns over time to the network. A tempo spatial pattern can be as simple as a time series of voltages, so the synapse firing can create & track a time series of voltages, so can the dendrite through ion charge build up, including dendritic action potentials, the soma, where the cells primary action potential event happens is a signal convergence event. The signal output could be a vector representing the frequency or phase or voltage or a wave, with one vector representing its frequency & amplitude (the magnitude of its chemical distribution) which are inversely related. The chemical pressure in the synaptic cleft could be increasing, which could lead to sodium ions being pushed into the next cell, even as the excitation of the membrane of the next cell is causing the next cell to explain and pull in new neurotransmitters like a balloon.
   793:    360:   23: So imagine that a low amplitude high frequency phasic action potential spike transmits both neurotransmitters and a mechanical wave that is received as sodium channels open on the other side of the synapse. The delta (or amount) of the mechanical wave ought to correlate 1:1 with the delta of the synaptic transmission.

   796:    391     16: from reading Buzsaki I dialed into the fact that frequency is the inverse of time.
   797:    392:    18: I thought about frequency being in the inverse of time and the inverse of amplitude, and the expansion of neurons in the soma right before they fire phasically (phasic firing is high frequency firing)
   798:    393     28: I realized that a high frequency firing might created a amplitude release of neurotransmitrers which might open lots of potassium channel receptors inhibiting other neurons faster, creating a collective representation in a columized layer, edge community, circuit, or neural array that would be collectively perceived by the next array, and so on, and that the entire bunch of neurons would learn invariant representations,

   805:    521:   5: I've considered the possibility also that a low frequency gamma pattern in the range of around 40z could be the tonic firing pattern for super high phasic firing patterns, such as something that is 500hz or 600hz

   809:    528:   47: One way to consider Information theory is as a description of how information can be encoded in the variations between frequent signals and infrequent signals, the frequency of tonic for example ought to have low information value, but by contrast the low information value of tonic signals might amplify the meaning of less common phasic signals, but if information can be encoded as phase changes between common signals that have little meaning, and uncommon signals that have more meaning then you can encode information in anything, and effectively information is encoded in amino-acid sequences in RNA & DNA.

   816:    659    25: And and so this allows to have this allows for patterns to have varying levels of frequency, right? And, and so sense.
   817:    660:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
   818:    661    55: And and of course other you know, that's in the sensory input areas. But the later on your reality is in the delta pattern and a data and in somewhere else hasn't the data pattern and and and, and, and it's in it, it's really in the contrast between the basic firing patterns and the, the resonating contrast because patterns resonate and the alpha frequency and the beta, frequency, the data, and the gamma frequency, but the amount of possible, right?

   821:    668:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
   822:    669    327: This triggers some ideas for amplifying the human sense of smell, by considering how the shape of a dog's olfactory bulb, and the rates & types of its signal pathways are different from the human nose. I imagine that the sense of smell might be heavily influenced by the frequency of the whole brain and that people who use caffiene to stay in a beta brainwave state might have their sense of smell deteriorate more over time compared to people who meditate deeply & do yoga.

So a longer duration or longer duration I so I'm still trying to figure out if the longer duration of the action potential means of phasic.

There's temporal properties and there's also phasic properties. It's not just spatial and temporal was also the phase in each location of the temple. Spatial as it's actually have a frequency and and and if you could draw if you could draw a frequency through just one dot through one through one point of one vector.

What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?

   836:    834    264: So even if it temporarily changes its frequency because it fired it sooner or later than it normally fires, that's just this temporary pattern but this actually what we want. Because like imagine that when you move from the left to the right, not only is it the case that neurons need to fire.
   837:    835:   326: This is the event baboon, I don't know if that's right. Maybe that's something I sound but but that is a, that is a different. It's not a tonic frequency, that's a phasic frequency, it's a phasic pattern. It's phase of frequency pattern and so you can say it, we can go into.
   838:    836    328: Well the brain is consists of temporal and spatial patterns time patterns spatial patterns, and to, and temporal and it'll end and they also can convince. It's also tonic and it's also a sort of like dialectic between tonic and physic firing patterns. All right? So a face of physic firing pattern can happen, which is, you know, it's a different frequency.
   839:    837    330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
   840:    838:   350: That is very regular and it's a whole bunch of neurons doing it. So it's not really information but then you have phasic firing which is unique and if that's like when the piano when you hear a piano note, that's the phasic firing and that faceobok firing is much, it's much higher for frequency.
   841:    839    352: That could be like a 200 Hertz, gamma frequency or something. But I'm also arguing that the entire brain from the canvas of consciousness and tonic frequency range to the physic firings and higher frequency ranges. I consist of consists of temples spatial frequencies between 0.02 hertz and as high as 600 hertz.

   843:    897     63: Between like these are these are non-neuron cells that can do this and neurons are more capable than these non neurons cells, so I have this opportunity here to sort of like basically like design a new perceptron a new artificial neuron a new artificial neural network, that is not just frequency information but it's.
   844:    898:    65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
   845:    899    105: It does it's gonna do not just frequency information it will do and not just amplitude information it'll do spatial information because the larger amplitude will have a spatial impact on the next layer of cells, but also not only that. But this but I'm talking about a true 3D neural network so right now we have 2D internal networks now a 3D neural network means that every neuron and every every neuros circuit so neuro circuit is several neurons linked together and went in you know, the whole the whole time window of a neuron when it fires to when it reset is going to be like 10 milliseconds.

  1164    1463    46: And so they are basically because of the large oscillators are receiving, not knowledge patterns in the small oscillators. And because of the principles, a lot must oscillators are causing that energy to dissipate the causing the novel oscillations. The novel firing the bright and brighter and the inhibited to return to a ton of firing rate and they do this the way that oscillators work, the large oscillator absorbs, the smaller one, and gradually.
  1165:   1464:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.

  1176    1494    321: If the action potential resonates a lot over time the growth can be a lot. A lot of energy can flow towards certain patterns, and those densely connected learned patterns (via synaptic connections) have a lot of attractive power (in the sense of being attractors in an oscillatory network) These patterns become memories that pull, attract, or drive other patterns to make connections. (like oscillators attracting & absorbing other oscillators)
  1177:   1495:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  1178    1496    341: I wanted to say that the excitatory/inhibitory fast wave ripple process that might lead to LTP in some instances and LTD in other instances is creating a multi-neuron oscillating assembling pattern, that drives behavior.

  1183  
  1184:   1878     13: But, and oscillation frequency allows the, the oscillation frequency is seen when you have, let's say that the gamma frequency is defined by the decay rate of the, of the inhibition of signal or the LTD signal and so you have. But you have with the camera, you have this sort of like linking or association or binding of different gamma patterns or cross multiple reasons of the brain that happened had some sort of coincidental pattern in temp and time or space or stale, or break or frequency.
  1185    1879:    15: And so the gamma oscillation is accomplished again. Oscillation is basically of large group and oscillator is an oscillator. A larger group that's firing together and it's the decay rate sets the cadence of the gamma oscillation the decay rate of the action of the higher phasic action potential, which inhibits in thereby neurons.

  1194:   2057:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  1195    2058    17: Is it like, very fast but very thin or is it very broad? But very powerful. I'm very slow, very bright. Yeah broaden everything. If it was broadens slow or fast and thin, right? And so yeah, the slower tonic oscillation is sort of like resetting the whole neighborhood, right? That's the, that's how coordinated activity happens.

And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
  1212:   2198    113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?
  1213  

  1222    2415    50: Because the brain primarily communicates with itself via phase changes, tempo-spatially distributed phase changes, producing a phase space with its tonic oscillators, that are tracking phase changes (predictive coding, neurons predicting when they are going to fire), and thus observing phase changes

  1224    2417    68: But in general a slower oscillation over time ought to result in a larger group of neurons being pulled into the same oscillator. So maybe what it means is that the triggering of the group of neurons is more even, because each terminal is getting more transmitters?

  1282:   2675:    658:   49: So that means that the novel firing is of phasic, phase of firing is a resonator or at the decaying oscillator and oscillator is almost like a harmonic oscillator and that it has more regularity in, you know, it stays like the alpha frequency. But that is with that regularity is about like if you see an alpha figure there's like a lot of different levels of alpha because those different levels of alpha represent the phase field, being a change by inhibition patterns and firing patterns, they're defining the depths of the phase field that defines your reality.
  1283:   2676     665:   261: *That inspires our minds to imagine that an anti-gravity propulsion technology could be accomplished with an oscillation pattern is a splay state (relatively opposite in the timing of it's oscillatory intervals) to the oscillation frequency of gravity (the Quantum Gradient Time Dilation). 
  1284:   2677:    666:   325: As cells become oscillating assemblies, synchronizing their tonic firing rates, they become a powerful attractor to sparse fast phasic bursts from the incoming senses. (this may explain why it there might be an evolutionary incentive for your brain to throw away most of it's incoming sensory data before it reaches the neocortex, with the exception of the Olfactory sense which probably requires high spatial amplitude & lower frequency sensory input channels for increased spatial resolution of the tiny particles that visit your nose & mouth. Which might explain why 4/5 of the Olfactory input channels do not have their signals routed through thalamic nuclei before colliding with the neo cortex. (this paragraph is loaded with big assumptions that need further research).
  1285:   2678     673:   67: # In this book I argue that the morphology of the dendrite represents the long term memory at the synaptic level, and the phase oscillation rate and duration represent the magnitude & frequency of the dendritic memory detection.

  1287:   2706     818:   17: It's dimension. It's the speed of their spin, right? The speed the frequency. This is feet is like frequency of the oscillation, but it's but it's it's that's inverted to their amplitude, right? So if they go faster, they're smaller to go slower and it's then it's, that's bigger. It's a bigger effect in that sense, in that sense the the that's a mechanism for.
  1288:   2707:    828:   15: Yeah, that's interesting. So this is a question like well what is the tonic oscillation like action potential? What is a tonic oscillation action potential like compared to the phasic action potential, right? Is the fate does, the phasic action potential have a greater amplitude and a lower frequency or higher frequency in a lower amplitude?
  1289:   2708     835:   330: It's much faster. You can travel much farther, it's not regular, it's novel. It happens more rare. And as soon as it happens, the rest of the neurons that it oscillates with, they, they start to pull it back into the regular tonic frequency. So that, you know, when you play a piano, the tone doesn't stay loud.
  1290  
  1291:   2721     891:   81: So that could mean that you have an oscillation that where, okay? So let's say that you have like an offer frequency oscillation that has a certain pattern that is that has special and turnable characteristics that are you unique identifiers for a specific pattern. They represent maybe they represent a flower, okay?
  1292:   2722:    896:    65: It's frequency information, it's spatial information and it's phasic information. And it's phasic in the sense of the oscillator of the macroscopic also to oscillatory pattern of brain activity because there's because neural networks are non-temporal. I mean there they don't have. They don't have oscillations and neural network has inputs and it has an output and it's done but it's not active in a in a temporal way, it doesn't have different office obsulatory patterns, you're saying that.
  1293:   2723     898:   113: Then then then the one millisecond that that we each have for memory. Is by is by continuing to repeat the same message in a group. And. And in general, you know, you have what's interesting is you have neurons will will oscillate in large groups and if you have one neuron that fires out of the frequency of the rest of the group of oscillations like for example your super kids manic nucleus, which is which was the thing that that sets your your when you go to sleep and when you're awake, it's your that's your primary 24 hour clock, right?

    66:   25: but changes in dendritic spines that reduce or increase active potassium receptors may have the biggest effect on short term memory as the neurons spike is going to close sooner or later, resulting in higher frequency, low amplitude, small novel sequence firing, faster phasic spikes (information broadcasting) or low frequency, high amplitude, group guassian firing, slower tonic spikes (information observation).

    71:   43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.

   227:   78: We may need to model the ionotropic brain. That means modeling how calcium and potassium ions, stored in the dendrite soma, are changing amplitude & frequency of the action potential, which changes the synaptic output, ie how many vesicles are activated, and what types of neurotransmitter are released downstream, which further alters the ionotropic balance of dendrites on the receiving end. If one neuron is connected to 200 downstream neurons, when that one neuron fires, with varying strength, varying amounts of vesicle activation, varying quantities and types of neurotransmitters, how are those 200 downstream neurons affected in a different way?

And if you have at the at the frequency of of the action potential is shorter than the amplitude of its radius is going to be larger think because there's a there's a there's an inverse relationship so if the if the frequency is smaller the amplitude is larger if the amplitude is smaller, the frequencies longer or larger.

Moreover, the precise oscillation frequency can have profound consequences in terms of synchronization properties (correlation, phase relations). Hence, we argue that manipulations of detuning represent a key experimental target to causally infer oscillatory properties without strongly affecting other network properties. Advanced multi-neuron electrophysiological and optical techniques (optogenetics, cellular voltage imaging) in future studies will provide exciting possibilities to measure and target frequency generation in neural oscillations and synchronization during cognition and behavior."

  1199:   1261    2607:     68:   17: When it comes to the thermodynamics of consciousness, slower oscillations are going to be aware of and perhaps disturbed by phasic burst firing patterns, because fast non-oscillating information representing waves of phases are costly and inherently disturb and threaten to destabilize the low frequency group oscillations
  1200:   1262:   2608:     69:   43: The Neurons synapses, via Potassium are preseting the criteria for what patterns the neuron will respond to, and they are presetting the shape of the wave form of the axonal action potential, by changing the time for when it closes, which will determine the amplitudinal/frequency deviation from its local oscillatory body should its threshold be triggered early into a phasic burst or should it become inhibited from firing tonically.
  1201:   1263    2609      74:   206: so quantum general relativity is suggesting that at scales from quantum physics, to astrophysics to neurophysics there is an inverse relationship between amplitude (density & volume of mass) and frequency (energy) and that gravity is caused by the coherence and decoherence patterns in the phase field of spacetime between oscillating bodies that are either in phase (coherence expanding spacetime) or out of phase (decoherence shrinking spacetime as masses dissolve or explode)

  86  “Hemo-EncephalographyIn 1999, the late Hershel Toomim and Robert Marsh were awarded the US patent on HEG. HEG uses light to observe blood in the brain through the skull.In 2009, Hershel Toomim and I had the opportunity to discuss the wave. Had he seen it using HEG? His answer was, that he had looked for it, but “No”, he had not seen it. His thinking was that for cerebral homeostasis, the brain micro-manages blood flow, normalizing the wave.
  87: “Hemo-EncephalographyBut could it be a matter of filtering, i.e. very low frequency signals were being excluded? (The way we were able to see the wave plethysmographically was by eliminating the low frequency filtering of the state-of-the-art heart rate variability instrument.)Hershel and I agreed to consider it..He passed away in 2011 at age 95.
  88  “This year I learned that Jonathan Toomim, Hershel’s grandson had continued his HEG research.I connected with Jonathan via Skype, and learned that he had developed a research instrument without filtering.”

   94: You're basically enough to tell me more so they blast a radio signal at the watering and and specific frequency and it causes the because the water molecules to release a to release energy which is as a specific frequency of a camera waiting on the other side. So the mat, so the magnet for big giant magnet where it does is, that's, that's, it's getting your molecules aligned, and then they hit it with a radio frequency and when the magnet stops and then the might be that long.

  100: And so because it's admitting that specific frequency while it's traveling on a specific line and your caching it from specific angle. You're like you're the camera that does to your next capture and account is doing a why capture and account is doing a z capture at least three and then you can do tensor calculus on and figure out the position and direction of those water molecules to become your tensors or resolution of data, you get from them.

  154: You have the incoming, something that you see the idea is going to be a popularized, is that photons are bouncing off of that and they're bouncing off your eye, and then they're triggering brainwaves and these right ways. They have characteristics that in time, you know, play frequency patterns, and they characteristics and in space, right?

   67: Essentially the tonic oscillation frequency of the oscillating group of cells is the canvas of consciousness, and the changes to it, via the release of 0 1 2 or 3 vesicle sacks at each interval relative to the group oscillation is the paint of the minds internal representations or qualia inside the mind that is perceived by the observer that is the oscillating group of cells

  118: 16. I applied Buzsáki's work to Steven Strogatz (in the book Sync) work to connect Oscillations brainwaves at EEG scale to phase variation produced oscillations at the neuronal scale & neurotransmitter scale, and unified neural firing with brainwave firing via the hypothesis that magnitude is inverted to frequency at all scales of the universe, including at the scale of individual neuron action potential firing & at the scale of brainwaves from cortical columns or oscillating groups of cells. https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/e84c247b5a9a0f1d24bb41048368e1eba032c1a1/a0079z.md
