(humor) Word of the day "Computational-AstroNeuroPhysics" what kind of neuromorphic chip based program simulates the holographic duality of quantum fluctuations in the microtubules of your neurons that drive everyone crazy while Mercury is in retrograde ostensibly because of gravitational or electromagnetic forces? How does the density of a moving planet alter the curvature of space so as to impact the flow of the oscillation canvas of an expectation based heirarchical spatial temporal consciousness in a computer chipset? Further how can we program our artificial attractor trains of spiking neurons to balance a cellular dissipative system in response to the changing density of spacetime so as to export entropy and maintain structural equalibrium? Welcome to "Computational-AstroNeuroPhysics 101" This is a class your grandchildren will be taking in the future. To begin your study read this: http://medicalxpress.com/print293346930.html 

(humor) Yes as we speak I'm writing the book on computational-astroneurophysics, chapter one is on the mass consumption of microantinutrients via certain foods, via temporal rituals, ie drinking holidays, and how these events disrupt the metabolism of the masses collating with the quantum equilibrium of a cell and how that is inversely proportional via holographic duality to the surging electromagnetism that comes simultaneously with the changing curvature of spacetime when the mass Earth moves closer to the mass of Jupiter. Resulting in an Myelin based exploitation of phase transitions to aid the plasticity of your changing mind in accepting this new information http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-07-myelin-exploits-phase-transitions.html

Laws don't protect people, laws are by their nature reactive programs, at best they are threats of retaliation for socially unacceptable behavior.
