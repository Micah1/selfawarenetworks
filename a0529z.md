Monica Anderson I reserve the right to disbelieve experiments that imply a paradigm shift in six disciplines. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

Monica Anderson Seen it. Smells very fishy and I'm going to ignore it until there are TWO replications.

Micah Blumberg that's probably wise, not sure why it seems fishy or extraordinary, except that you probably have a different preferential logic

Monica Anderson Answer me this: How does sperm in a rat's testicles know what neurons in the brain that will code for fear to a flowery smell?

Monica Anderson How do they know that's what they need to encode? How do they encode it (in what medium? DNA?) and how do they escape demethylation which happens at conception. How does the message passed imprint the brain of the offspring? How can they fit that information into the DNA + external load? How does the body even know *what* sensory expression is worth passing on to the offspring.

These questions just scratch the surface and I cannot conceive of any mechanism that could provide the reported result.

Micah Blumberg "Answer me this: How does sperm in a rat's testicles"

I will answer.

This is a very old idea I came to hypothesize after studying LTP. I had this idea way before this study came along, so when it did come along I wasn't really surprised.

In order for a new long term potential memory to form, a new protein must be synthesized by a neuron, and this new protein permanently alters it's physical structure, it's mass, it's energy dissipation requirements, how much energy it takes to cause it's action potential to fire, and how much entropy it can tolerate before dissolution. It's new structure, the result of LTP, is a new genetic structure, a tiny change that can be transmitted when the creature self replicates.

If the offspring's genetic structure resembles the parent's genetic structure, then the memory in this case can simply be a gene based structural similarity between parent and child.

Neuroscientists today think there are many, perhaps between 5 and 8 or even more types of memory systems in the human brain, sort of evolving on top of one another.

So that's how this type of memory can be plausible, but also how it can be just one of several types of memory.

The new neuron structure may or may not result in the same memory, there is a chance it could result in the fear of a very different smell, I'm not sure what the odds are, and I think that's my point, no one knows what the odds are. The odds that the new neural structure, caused by new protein synthesis, caused by LTP, causes a new memory, and a new dna pattern that sperm can pass onto offspring, that causes grandchildren to fear smells their grandparents learned to fear, isn't impossible by any means, and if we knew the odds, which we don't, we might not scoff at the idea of it being an extraordinary claim, it might be pretty ordinary.
