# OpenAI Whisper Transcription

my my time with the with the machine set up with the machines that brain

simulation machines with the process that I called the neomind cycle treatment

the neomind cycle alternative biotherapy treatment you know it's

the neurofeedback so called the neomind cycle so neurofeedback was another part

of the inspiration the word neofed neurofeedback is close to the word

neomind cycle neurofeedback it's got like there's three large simp three large I

mean so neuro is is two syllables but neurofeed is that they're really close

together and then you have feed which is almost in one set it's almost in one

syllable and then back which is another syllable so you see you have four

syllables but they're sort of spaced like as if there are three so neurofeedback

sort of spaces if there's three syllables because two of them real close to each

other and then you have neomind cycle so neo is technically also to to syllables

to you know and then you have mind cycles is to cycle is to so but the

point what the purpose of this was that my time with you know I had about two

years in which I was periodically subjecting my brain to this really

advanced neurofeedback with light and sound so it was a lot of treatments a

lot of self-treatments and that in in in hindsight I'm like wow my brain was my

brain went through some radical transformations between then and now

like I've gone through so many character like character evolutions like I've I've I feel like

I've lived through different personalities and seen and absorbed and I feel like you

know like but you know that you know that saying like that I contain

multitudes I feel like I have modeled so many different personalities just not

like creative models of them and done such amazing like basically personalities

that are rendered to the same sort of you know resolution even higher than my

own then you know my own self construct my own understanding of myself and I

think it helps to like when you model so many different you know other people's

mind you're modeling you in threat your life you're modeling other people's

minds right and the complexity the complexity of the understanding you

have of other people and being able to predict their minds and know who they

are that that really that lets you get to you know but in any case like I had a

weird I had an unusual experience like that a mind-altering experience that

probably altered my mind for the long term probably altered the way I think

forever and it involved you know light and sound machine isochronic beats and

or I'm not sure what isochronic beats and and alternately brain binaural

beats lots of binaural beats lots of meditation with different programs

different light and sound machines without e.g. just you know audio bass only

brain wave entertainment I did a lot of that and having like all sorts of like

the there's the I've had a transcranial of direct-to-current

stimulation machine I had a those I bought from focus foc.us and I had a

TACS transcranial as with is it has it with a TACS is

oh shoot I can't get them off the top of my head but but but yes a TACS is another

electrical stimulation device and that you in this in this case I clipped

something to each of my ears and electrode was basically put to each of

my ears and then that sent that sent us a signal across to just to apparently

like basically stimulate the center of my brain between the two ears I guess

is hypothesis is how it works it's electrical stimulation that runs

straight through you between your ears and let's see and then we have oh new

tropics lots of new tropics that have had over the years that have also you know

caught like so you take a new tropics right and you know they maybe they're

doing something that excites your brain maybe or supports your memory function

and and these new tropics are interfacing with the with the oscillations

of your mind in a way that is you know they're what they're with the hundred

year effect of you know a person taking new tropics isn't well known yet we

guess people are you know I guess I guess everyone in the world is a

guinea pig with depending on the in some way in some ways because there's there

are not we're lacking in like it would be great if everyone in the world was

participating in scientific studies if we had like mass scale scientific studies

and we asked everyone in the world to participate in these studies and you know

like you know what like the idea is like well what if robots take over our jobs

what can what can we look in the people do well the people can do science work

there's lots of science work that needs to be done you know there's there's we

get robots to take over the all the little the current human jobs there's a

lot of things that we don't have enough people for that we need more people for

and sure at some point like we'll have robots that can do that too but but the

but the but you think that there's it's like right now it seems like there's

and there's an infinite supply of work and a limited supply of people we want to

do it and a limited and a limited supply of people total and so imagine that

there's so many workers unlimited workers that we that we basically run

out of work and so that means that like in a long enough time line we eventually

run out of work because we have so many workers we're able to do everything and

everyone in human being could could help with science you know or you know with

art the the way people could collaborate with you know with machines to do like

to accomplish next generation beats of beautiful architecture or maybe space

ships and colonize over planets and expand out into space and you know maybe

it would be like never mind I was gonna mention some science fiction to you show

but it would be too much humor but yeah like my like this I I favor the idea

that my brain was altered for the better however I mean I feel like like I

really became a machine in terms of my ability to read books and consume

information and identify high-level patterns you're basically to scale to

be able to scale between high-level and low-level patterns really easily and to

be able to like compare like ice there's you might find an isomorphic pattern

in in one domain of science within be able to identify an isomorphic pet that

imagine isomorphic pattern in another domain of science right when when you

know what John Carmack refers to is like when you're when you're reading a book

about rockets about how rockets are made and suddenly a concept from how gun

powder works like helps you to imagine a new rocket design that might be a lot

more efficient and like and like yeah so John Carmack has it has described

experiences like that where you're reading an idea in a book that's

unrelated to the topic that you're reading but you'll you're able to pull

out like an information configuration that's sort of like substrate and

variant and that now it works you know now we can go from you know take the

lessons how rocket rockets work and and make better guns or vice-versa make use

the lessons of how guns work but yeah it is interesting to sort of like you

know I'm arguing basically that patterns are not just invariant

temporally invariant spatially but they're invariant in scale because of

this magnification of patterns and this it's the magnification but it's also

like you could think of as divergence like when it goes from the neuron level

to the screen of the oscillation level that's a divergence and then each of the

neurons at risk that is part of that oscillation is this is firing in that

also in that oscillation is sort of

participating in the collective group activity of sort of representing that

pattern because they are they were all firing at the same time but because that

pattern the pattern of incoming signals just sort of like stoked a disruption to

their normal cycle so now now they are there the really comfortable sort of

synchronization that they all had has become disrupted with the coherence

patterns because in new because because the differences of the action

potential and of the subsequent inhibited set you know it's not just action

potential but it's also like either an acceleration message because it it

caused more more sodium channels to open or it's like hey go faster cut more

sodium channels open or hey go slower more potassium channel and more

potassium channels open with SNAPs and that that causes decoherence because now

like we it's like you had the whole groups awesome together and their response

gives like a bunch of them a bunch of them now get excited right and a bunch

of them now get depressed right so now their surface is responding to the to

the print it's like that it's like the surface of the oscillation is now has

negative edges and it has positive edges the negative edges are the inhibitions

and the positive edges are the excitations and that canvas is now it's

it's it's a decoherence pattern has been pressed into it from the action

potential that and it's basically scaling up the action potentials to a

larger scale that is now something that you know it that that that that is like

it's like reversing the that's rendering it's like rendering a piece of an

image from outside your body right because that because the image comes to

your eye and it you know the dendrite has receptors right so the dendrite is

going to receive signals on its receptors and at that point that the

the signals are going through a convergence point there the synapses

of the receiving of each of the dendrites is converging and the dendrites

only going to fire if the it's getting enough data but it's only going to get

data from the synapses that are active and so the synapses are other active to

find the pattern that it's a capable of seeing at that moment in time right and

they're only in that they're not just they're not just active but they're

also active in terms of their their the temporal interval of the synapse you'd

have to have like to you have to have like a coincidence firing event you'd

have to like you know the signals would have to arrive within milliseconds of

each other so I'm not exactly sure that but they have to arrive within milliseconds

of each other because otherwise the the membrane of the dendrite is is leaky so

it's like so the pattern can arrive all at once or it can arrive at different

times right so different parts of the pattern can again come in at different

times so it's in that sense it's it's synapse invariant in terms of like the

the the pattern has been learned to synapse invariant and sometimes like a

partial pattern may trigger the neuron to fire it's like if it's seen so it's

missing like part of the pattern it's able to recognize it because there's

enough it's received enough information and if you I guess if you go with the

sparse distributed representation idea I guess you only need a like maybe two you

only need maybe two two points two synapses to fire within three milliseconds

in order to create a like a coincidence pattern at the minimum you'd need you

you probably need to because because because that because the phase is going

to be a phase change is a change in the is like if it's like it's it's it's

increasing or decreasing right but you probably need you're gonna need at least

two synapses to fire because that means that there is a coincidence happening

that is going to plot that that might a coincidence happening that that might

have enough scale to cause the action potential event whereas like if you had

just one synapse fire you would think that you know that that's not going to

be enough to cause that the threshold to fire because that means the threshold

to set at one and right right and there's there's basically no point to the

threshold at that point there'd be no point to there being a synapse at all it

might as well be like just it might as well just be like a an electric

synapse then right if there's if the threshold is one and it's reached

literally every time no matter what so it just it's just like I think you need

to have at least two at a minimum and then and then maybe you know like that's

it's it's weird to think but that that might be you know cuz cuz I don't know

I don't know cuz I guess it could be just one synapse and then one more fire

from the same synapse like cuz it cuz it cuz the charge of sodium ions if you

only if you only let's see I think yeah it's really like it's really

interesting to sort of speculate about that because yeah cuz because even with

it
