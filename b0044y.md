# Major arguments found in this note:
1. Theta Wave Patterns as a Reality Generator: You discuss how your perception of reality is shaped by stable, low-frequency theta wave patterns. These patterns act as a foundation for processing incoming sensory data, creating a "rendering" of reality that is flexible enough to handle a wide range of sensory inputs (e.g., visual, auditory, heat).

2. Neural Texture Sensing: There is an emphasis on how neurons can sense and process different textures, frequencies, and amplitudes of stimuli (e.g., brightness and frequency of light) and that neurons interpret phase changes in light and other sensory inputs to render internal representations of reality.

3. Fractal Hierarchy and Functional Isomorphism: You introduce the idea that neural processes across different scales repeat similar patterns, resembling fractals. These fractal-like structures, such as dendrites, might behave in isomorphic ways across different scales of neural activity, creating transformations that contribute to perception and cognition.

4. Prioceptive Feedback System and Neural Timing: A detailed explanation of how hand movements and perception are processed in real time, involving neural firing patterns down to the millisecond scale. This suggests that perception and action are intricately linked to precise timing mechanisms in neurons.

5. Neural Convergence and Divergence: The note discusses how neural signals in the brain diverge and converge. For instance, granule cells receive converging signals from smaller sets of neurons but also fan out into larger networks, demonstrating how information is both amplified and refined through neural circuits.

6. Perception of Space and Size through Neural Feedback: A fascinating exploration of how humans can perceive the size of spaces in their minds even without visual input. You describe the brain's capacity to mentally expand or shrink the size of imagined spaces, indicating the flexibility of neural rendering.

7. Functional Morphology of Neurons: There is a metaphor comparing dendrites to hands, suggesting that neurons' branching structures serve as functional extensions of their "body," capable of intricate actions akin to a biological organism, possibly inspired by the actions of white blood cells.

8. Memory and Neural Divergence/Convergence: The relationship between the granule cells in the brain, which converge incoming signals from one region and diverge signals to another, mirrors broader principles of neural information processing, where convergence and divergence co-exist as fundamental organizational principles.

# Whisper Transcript: 

# 1. Theta Wave Patterns as a Reality Generator
I just say that I feel more transparent in terms of understanding how my head is doing,

in terms of what my theta patterns are doing, in terms of creating this sort of stable oscillatory signal

that just waits for incoming data to update some parts of it.

# 2. Neural Texture Sensing:
So it's just made like this reality, just this very stable low frequency theta pattern,

theta noise pattern, so the theta phase changes in the theta wave.

And that's what my rendering of the reality is made out of,

but it's very like you can send in signals of many different scales and many different kinds of signals,

many different textures, and it can process it all.

The neurons have this ability to sense all kinds of textures and heat and audio and visual.

They can process the energy of the phase changes in reality, in the light.

It's like you have light that has certain kinds of frequency,

and it has certain kinds of spectrum amplitude, the frequency amplitude.

You have light of different frequency and different amplitude.

I mean in terms of how bright is it, if there's one example, there's a lot of light or very little light,

so there's range in the brightness.

So frequency means that you could have light that could be flashing very fast or it could be very slow.

In the amplitude, it could be slow but it could be very warm.

I'm just trying to say there's a lot of different ways to portray light.

There's basically this whole, it sounds obvious to say it out loud,

but it's kind of something you don't really think about is the fact that if you can see it in your mind,

then your brain can render that.

Whatever you can see in your mind or with your eyes,

or whatever you can perceive with any of your senses, maybe you don't have eyes or no,

whatever you can see in your mind's eye,

if you can imagine a place, if you can imagine anything that you're seeing in your mind,

your mind has to be capable of rendering that graphically because you're perceiving it graphically.

If you're perceiving a visual representation or the graphics of a place or the space of a place,

you're visualizing the space of a place or if you just can sense the feel or know,

if you could just kind of know the size of the place,

even if you close your eyes, you just kind of know the size of the place that you're in.

# Perception of Space and Size through Neural Feedback:

If you keep your eyes closed and just imagine suddenly the space, you keep your eyes closed.

Imagine suddenly the spaces you're in just became very big, much bigger.

In a place, it's way bigger than the place you're at right now.

Oh, this is massive, it just keeps growing.

The place just keeps growing, but you're back to normal, you're back to reality.

You can open your eyes.

It's just this idea that we have this sense of space.

# Fractal Hierarchy and Functional Isomorphism:
Going to the fractal hierarchy, fractal functional isomorphism,

it is this thing that we see with EEG and MEG and MRI that there's,

it seems like the signals at one scale are repeating at another scale.

There's similarity or isomorphism where you see a system going through several transformation states.

And as part of a routine oscillation, it's just some sort of physical pattern happens.

And you say, oh, wait a second now.

For one thing that's interesting is that the dendrite is tree-like, it's branch-like.

Your hand is actually kind of branch-like.

# Functional Morphology of Neurons
Your hand is kind of like a dendrite in a way.

It's not actually, but it's not functionally.

Your hand is, but think about it for a second.

Imagine with a neuron that its branches are actually like its hand.

It's an alien hand.

To us, it's just branches, but to it, what if that's like its hand?

It's its body.

And I say this because I was reading in John Lee's book that the white blood cell can sprout arms

and pull and push and prod and force its way through the cellular structure.

It's like a little man, it's like a little bear.

The white blood cell crawls through this forest that's you to get to the destination where he does his job.

And meanwhile, he's coordinating with headquarters.

We're giving him steps along the way to help guide him.

Okay, where do I go next? Can you imagine this dense mess of a forest of flesh that is never ending?

You can never get outside of it, okay?

But it's just like there's no road signs.

Even if you had a road sign, it would be fucking confusing.

What does this road sign mean?

Does this road sign mean I need to go through this wall of flesh or that wall of flesh?

# Prioceptive Feedback System and Neural Timing

It's very confusing, but it's kind of like I think of the prioceptive feedback system.

The prioceptive feedback system is where you can stick out your hand and you can think about something you want to grab with your hand

and you can move your hand closer to grabbing that thing and eventually to grabbing that thing.

But if you divide that in your hand movement in time, imagine you film to your hand movement at some normal speed

reaching it out and picking up something that you would normally pick up

or imagine someone else doing it if you want.

Just think about what happens in your mind at each interval and time.

Imagine that it takes a second.

You think, okay, I'm going to pick this up.

So you take that one second and now divide it into pico seconds or something.

Imagine it's like a movie and at every interval of time, you pick the interval of time, it could be milliseconds.

Then that's because I think neurofiring, people think of it as something that's happening on the scale of milliseconds, maybe 3 milliseconds for synapse to detect

that it's been triggered.

It's weird. It's like a synapse has its own threshold.

That makes neurons so fucking complex.

I think what it represents is a learned pattern.

Here's what I'm saying.

With the thing with the granule cells, you had the situation where the granule cells were...

Okay, so they're converging signals from their perspective.

# Neural Convergence and Divergence
The granule cells are converging signals from the enterino cortex.

But from the enterino cortex, they're diverging signals to the granule cells, period.

They're diverging signals because there's a million granule cells or something like that.

Then there's something in the order of 50,000 enterino cortex cells.

It's like this massive fanning out.

They're from a small amount of cells to a comparatively larger amount of cells.

So you'd have this fanning out or divergence.

Convergence is divergence, isn't it?

So you have this divergence of activity that's fanning out.

In a macroscopic way, these signals are diverging, but it's curious that from the granule cell's perspective, it is converging cells.

# Memory and Neural Divergence/Convergence
In fact, all of the neurons in the brain are converging signals and diverging signals at the same time.

The part that I think may not be really well thought about is this.

So if you have these, the signals are diverging, but they're also connecting like there's going to be like...

You're going to have like many different... You have like a huge number of... I forget the numbers.

But it's like a huge number. This is an important number too. I have it written down somewhere.

I think if you have... This is from the book by Buzaki.

He was saying, look, this is great. This was great. This was a great moment.

And the great thing about Buzaki is that his book is so good.

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

That makes sense. So here's the thing. So the way to structure the book is I have a lot of my own original material.

But what I'm good at is sort of like writing ideas while I think about someone else's material.

So if I use someone... So if I think of the book as like a series of articles.

And I like the way I'm thinking about this. It's like the outline is looking really good. It looks really good.

There's more stuff that I'm adding to it. It's growing.

So what I'm thinking about is the comprehension of the whole thing is a little bit hard to get at.

So I think that I want to go over each piece of evidence one more time.

Now I have an outline but this is a way of accomplishing two birds with one stone.

Which is that what I want to do is sort of like explore... I want to list of all the exhibits.

And then I want to sort of like explore the exhibits one at a time.

And just add that to the book. And so the book is just like about these exhibits.

This is like a Disneyland worth of stuff here.

So okay, so these are exhibits, right? There's tons of stuff to talk about.

So yeah, I can do that.

I think we should extend Hodgkin and Huxley with the Soliton Wave model.

And circle back to the original Hebbian Learning idea.

Okay, so let's make a timeline.

So we've got the creator of EEG: Hans Berger
