(emotion) 1133 website: Neo mind cycle is for the greater good

I have now the best neurofeedback machine anywhere, it's the most powerful experience I have ever tried!

It's better than brain state technologies, because they use neurofeedback + sound that can be changed with emotions,

I use neurofeedback + onscreen visuals, + audio you can change with feelings and thoughts and internal representations + light goggles that reflected the brainwave pattern and the brain entrainment pattern in isochronic beats that can also be brightened with emotions, or made to blink faster or slower + brainwave entrainment going from delta, to theta, to alpha, to beta, to gamma, in one session, and from gamma to beta to alpha to theta to delta in another session.

What I'm doing is better than biocybernaut, and that cost 25k for a three day retreat!
