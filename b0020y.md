I'm an entity module. And what I mean is that of oscillations in my brain, right? It's like, it's I say that there is a computational structure, like a 3D competition structure that of course, bonds to the three tissue layout of the human neural network. And where we have a.

00:39
I mean yeah you know the space is in 3D+1D and so is the space in our brain. So it's actually like a four, it's a four dimensional structure. The brightness. Is it changes over time?

00:53
But,

00:57
What I'm arguing, I guess.

01:05
It's the idea that

01:11
While there's multiple things when I'm just curious about that. Like okay. Well, if there's extra time to mentions, I mean, what I mean by that is like

01:27
If the if the way like imagine like there's actually three times dimensions. I mean like I'm not I'm not I'm just saying in terms of like maybe what? If there's like length time with time and lengthworth and height time, right? Like three kinds of time.

02:01
Right. And each kind of time has. It's like own, like, special properties. So it's just like almost like they're almost like three kinds of particles, right, right? In terms of like how their properties are different. But there are three kinds of time or three kinds of but what a bit like.

02:24
Okay. So let's forget let's consider that that you know how many dimensions, you know, what is the dimension? A dimension is of is um the dimension is like the minimum amount of of that you need to describe but geometry And if
