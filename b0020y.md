I consider my structure and the structure of spacetime.

Entity Module

00:08

I'm an entity module consisting of virtual phase patterns that exist temporarily in the oscillations of my brain.

There is a 3D virtual rendered computational structure that is the mind and it corresponds to the 3D tissue layout of the human brain's neural network. 

00:39

You know the space is 4D (or 3D+1D, three dimensions of space, and also dimensions of time) and so is the space in our brain. So it's actually like a four dimensional structure, the brain is, or a 3D structure that changes over time.

01:05

It's the idea that

01:11

While there's multiple things when I'm just curious 

# What if there's extra time dimensions?

, I mean, what I mean by that is like

01:27

If the if the way like 

Imagine like there's actually three time dimensions, or that we need to describe time in 3D to describe it accurately.

What if there is length time, width time, and height time, right?

Like three perspectives on a time field that need to be correlated to the electromagnetic field.

So we are not calculating spacetime as 3blue 1brown, but instead calculating spacetime as 3blue 3brown. 3 dimensions of space and 3 dimensions of time so we can consider how the odds of particle trajectories are altered by quantum gravity

02:01

Perhaps each kind of time (is defined by its quantum gradient time dilation state) has it's special properties.

So it's just like almost like they're almost like three kinds of particles, right?

In terms of like how their properties are different (time dilation difference, but also time dilation in special situations as it might be altered by bose einstein condensates and fermionic condensates).

But the point is to get away from thinking of time as a single monolithic thing, and make it more bit like, more variable, more flexible, more adjustable at the quantum, and atomic scales.

02:24

Okay. So let's forget that thought experiment.

Let's consider what is a dimension, you know, what is a dimension of space, and what is a dimension of time?

A dimension is the minimum amount of description you need to describe the geometry of a space.

In this situation I think 3 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time may not be enough. I think we need to think of time in 3 dimensions, as a field, and compare it to the electromagnetic field, to understand how it impacts QFT Quantum Field Theory.
