I'm an entity module, and what I mean is that of oscillations in my brain, right? This means I consist of virtual phase patterns that exist temporarily in the oscillations of my brain. It's like, it's to say that there is a computational structure, like a 3D computational structure, a virtual rendered structure corresponding to the 3D tissue layout of the human brain's neural network, that corresponds to the 3D tissue layout of the human neural network.

Well, we have a, I mean, you know, space is in 4D, and so is the space in our brain, so it's actually like a four, it's a four-dimensional structure, the brain is, because it changes over time, or it's like a 3D structure that changes over time. But what I'm arguing, I guess, it's the idea that, well, there's multiple things, when I'm just curious about that, like, okay, well, if there's extra time dimensions, what if we actually need to describe time in 3D, like space?

I mean, what I mean by that is, like, if the way, like, imagine, like, there's actually three time dimensions, length time, width time, and height time, I mean, like, I'm not, I'm just saying in terms of, like, if there's like, length time, width time, and length, width, and height time, right, like, three kinds of time, right, and each kind of time has its own, like, special properties, perhaps each kind of time is defined by its Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation state, which leads to different time dilation properties, especially in extreme conditions, such as within Bose-Einstein condensates or fermionic condensates.

So it's just like, almost like, they're almost like three kinds of particles, right, because their properties are different in how they interact with spacetime and quantum mechanics, in terms of, like, how their properties are different, but there are three kinds of time, or three kinds of, but like, okay, so let's forget, let's consider that, that, you know, how many dimensions, you know, what is the dimension? Let's move away from thinking of time as a single, monolithic dimension and instead consider how it might be more variable and flexible at quantum and atomic scales. The dimension is, the dimension is, like, the minimum amount of, of data that you need to describe, but gee, how much are you eating? Uh, no, I thought it was, I don't know where it comes from.

We also need to think about comparing time as a field, similar to how we understand the electromagnetic field, to explore how time impacts Quantum Field Theory (QFT). In this context, spacetime shouldn't be described as 3blue 1brown (3 dimensions of space + 1 dimension of time), but rather as 3blue 3brownâ€”3 dimensions of space and 3 dimensions of time. This would allow us to consider how quantum gravity alters the odds of particle trajectories and other quantum phenomena.
