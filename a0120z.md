Note from May 1, 2013
Self service via service of others is odder still if the self is a fiction that emerges from neural reflexes (neural reflexes? maybe I should have said cell functions) constituting a program whose job might be to consume the most neurotransmitters (what was I thinking in 2013?), by putting certain sequences of cell firings into place in response to events that fit some classification. http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/513681/memory-implants/?utm_campaign=socialsync&utm_medium=social-post&utm_source=facebook         

(I think I saved this note from 2013 because I wanted to revisit the question of how the activity of cell or a cluster of cells becomes motivated to serve the self or serve others, or to serve the self by serving others, and apparently this question occured in response to reading an MIT Technology Review story about Memory Implants

"Memory Implants
A maverick neuroscientist believes he has deciphered the code by which the brain forms long-term memories."

At the level of a cell we are talking about the growth of a plant function, it considers & reacts to information patterns, but like a computer, I do not imagine that self-awareness is actually existing in a single cell, or even in an entire cortical column, well maybe if the hippocampus is the alpha cortical column that could be, through the hippocampal, entorhinal, thalamic loop the root level for information based self-awareness. I'm speculating, but you have the basics of a reinforcement learning (when neurons fire, they electromagnetically stimulate the mitochondria to produce ATP, new protein synthesis, and cell growth including new receptors, and they signal Glial cells to participate in growing these new receptors and also to remove atrophied receptors (LTD, Long Term Forgetting.) recursive neural network, that takes incoming patterns, exports behaviors, learns from it's own behaviors, learns a model of itself, and then continues to improve its choices systematically over time.

The Choice Refinement theory, through the reinforcement learning (neuron firing stimulating ATP production) and recurrent network learning (oscillating activity patterns) the organism improves it's choices over time as it considers the environment.
