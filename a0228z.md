3 New Medical Imagining Technologies that have Neuroscientists salivating like Pavlov’s dogs.
These three exciting new medical scanning technologies have neuroscientists dreaming about the prospects of next generation of medical imaging that is better, cheaper, more affordable, and more accessible to researchers worldwide than existing medical imaging technologies.

1. The first is Openwater by Mary Lou Jepson

Openwater may or may not involve Holography, Lightfields, some variant of Tractography (the technology umbrella that includes Diffusion Tensor Imaging), and Geometric Neural Networking Analytics. Some Neuroscientists are speculating that Openwater’s NIR Holographic technology is similar to another technology which you can read about called OpenNirs at opennirs.org

My questions: Why is Mary Lou’s tech holographic? Is it like Tractography?

How similar is it to OpenNIRS and is OpenNirs also holographic or is that the big difference between OpenNirs and OpenWater? Opennirs.org

Opinion: AR VR Headsets can also be considered a new form of Brain Computer Interface, lets get these new Medical Sensing Technologies embedded in future AR VR headset designs.

End of story.

Previous story: This is my opinion on how Qualcomm could improve their XR Headset Reference Design. What’s your opinion? If you could design the ultimate mobile all in one AR/VR headset what would that look like, what features would it have?
